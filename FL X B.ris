AB  - The main obstacles to migrant workers starting businesses when they return to their hometowns are their own lack of financial literacy and aptitude, a lack of sufficient venture capital, and inadequate financing options. This paper conducts an analysis of the opportunities and challenges under the rural revitalization environment in conjunction with the Internet of Things Technology, through which a migrant labor entrepreneurship analysis platform is built. Data crawling technology is applied to capture internet data resources related to innovative entrepreneurship in the data collection module, and the entrepreneurship data is processed by the Internet of Things Technology. Based on the research, the approach suggested in this paper has its benefits for analyzing the opportunities and difficulties that migrant workers encounter in a rural revitalization context, in order to finally provide some theoretical support for pertinent research. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - After the collapse of the Rana Plaza building killed over a thousand garment workers in 2013, several transnational corporations partnered with nongovernmental organizations to offer factory-based training initiatives for women in Bangladesh. These programmes promote worthy goals, including women’s empowerment, menstrual health and financial literacy. But textual and visual analysis of lesson plans, awareness posters and instructional videos for workers reveal two mechanisms that undermine transformative change: They splinter worker solidarity through a focus on individualistic self-improvement (self-help) and facilitate business-as-usual by selectively revealing and concealing aspects of workers’ lives (surveillance). This study highlights the worker-facing side of corporate social responsibility and transnational business feminism’s turn toward empowerment education. These programmes purport to be good for business and for women. However, the training materials provide women with what I call ‘band aid’ remedies by telling women how to fix themselves and by strategically covering or exposing their problems. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The traditional market holds a pivotal role in Indonesia’s economy because it is the main contributor to national retail grocery transactions. Nevertheless, competition with modern markets and retailers makes their competitiveness lessened. From the financial side, traditional market SMEs are vulnerable to financial risks and still face obstacles in accessing financial resources due to a lack of financial literacy. In addition, the level of digitalization of traditional market SMEs technology is also still low, so digital adoption is still a challenge that must be faced. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the influence of financial and technological factors on the level of adoption of SME technology in traditional markets and its impact on the performance and sustainability of the SME business. This research will be conducted in a quantitative cross-sectional study of 225 SMEs in the traditional market. The sampling technique that will be used is judgmental sampling. This study’s research data will be analyzed using SEM-PLS. The study result shows that financial literacy positively affects SME financial accessibility and financial risk. The study also confirms that financial accessibility, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence are variables that significantly affect SMEs digital adoption, while the effect of financial risk on digital adoption is found to be insignificant. The study result also shows that SMEs digital adoption is positively affecting their performance, which eventually affects their business sustainability. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The present study develops a tool to measure financial literacy in the era of the post-COVID-19 pandemic while recognizing the challenges and changes posed by the pandemic. Investigating and validating it in the Arab context that lacked such measurement and a dire need for further exploration. It employed new financial concepts that emerged during and post-COVID-19 (e.g., e-wallet, emergency funds), besides adjusting some items from previous instruments (e.g., Yanto et al., 2021; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2019). An electronic questionnaire was distributed among Jordanian universities students. 507 valid responses were retained. Of the sample, females, employed students, bachelor’s degrees, and business and social science majors represent 51.7 percent, 36 percent, 78.5 percent, and 36.3 percent, respectively. A quantitative approach was conducted using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) via AMOS-SEM to validate the robustness of the model. The findings revealed that the EFA demonstrated 11 items with three factors retained for measuring financial literacy (FL) (knowledge, practice, and skills) agree with (Baistaman et al., 2020). Based on the CFA result, the model fits the indexes (CMIN/DF = 2.369, CFI = 0.985, GFI = 0.966, RMSEA = 0.052). Th developed tool is approved in its context, and it would assist policymakers in obtaining information necessary to enhance government strategies, namely, the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. © 2024 The Author.

AB  - Previous literature showed mixed results about the impact of CEOs’ financial literacy (CFL) on small and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs) innovation. This relationship can be motivated by relevant variables, which are missing in the previous literature and make a difference as mediators. In this sense, based on the theoretical framework related to upper echelon theory and resource-based view, this study focuses on the mediating effect of risk-taking attitude and management control systems (MCS) variables. Empirical data from 310 SMEs gathered using a qualitative research questionnaire are analyzed using structural equation modeling methodology. Specifically, estimations are carried out considering the partial least square method. Findings show that MCS and managers’ risk attitudes fully mediate the relationship between financial literacy (FL) and innovation. Between these two mediating variables, the implementation of MCS stands out because it also enables the mediating effect of CEOs’ risk-taking in the CFL–technological innovation relationship. As the results do not support the significant direct relationship between FL and risk attitude, they confirm an indirect effect through MCS. Furthermore, based on the study findings, SMEs’ directors and owners, business associations, and public authorities can improve SMEs’ technological innovation by implementing training programs and policies to foster CFL. They can also acknowledge the interdependency between organizational factors and individual characteristics to enhance SMEs’ technological innovation. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The dynamic development of modern technologies has changed the rules of the game in the financial market, including the insurance sector. While introducing digital business models may bring certain advantages for insurers, there is a widespread expectation of consumers to manage their financial affairs anytime and anywhere. This article sets out by demonstrating recent phenomena on the insurance market arising from its digitalisation, i.e., automation, personalisation, insurance on-demand, machine learning & artificial intelligence, Big Data, concluding distance contracts; along with the threats to consumer safety they pose a cyber risk that may materialise at different stages of the digital insurance selling process. Further, to provide insights into how modern digital insurance markets work, the article presents the results of a study conducted by the authors on a representative sample of 2,136 respondents from Poland. The study allows one to identify certain behaviour patterns of customers in their dealings with providers of insurance products and services as well as their approach to technological innovations introduced by the traders. Crucially, the study shows that insurance consumers have a positive attitude towards the use of modern technologies in insurance, however, their knowledge on this subject is still limited. Specifically, insurance consumers tend to be more afraid of cyber risks than any legal risks resulting from deploying new technologies in the insurance sector. In conclusion, the article maps out key regulatory challenges related to ensuring consumer protection on digital insurance markets. © 2024

AB  - The objective of this article was to analyze the factors that determine the level of financial literacy in Mexican adults, the method used for the analysis was an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model. The results reveal that age, marital status, education, number of dependents and income level in the central and southern regions were positively associated with the financial literacy index; while men and having a job were negatively associated. One of the limitations of the study lies in the number of observations regarding some variables considered. The originality of the work consists in the fact that evidence is provided considering the characteristics at the individual level for Mexico. The findings obtained can be useful for the design of public policies as well as serve as a basis for subsequent studies. Objective: The objective of conducting an investigation into the literality of financing may be to fully understand the specific provisions and clauses of financial contracts. This may include analyzing the terms and conditions set forth in loan agreements, lines of credit or other forms of financing to fully understand the obligations and responsibilities of the parties involved. Theoretical Framework: Various proposals have been developed to measure financial literacy/inclusion (BANAMEX, 2018; Dabla-Norris et al., 2015; OECD, 2018) however, in this work the methodology developed by OECD (2018) is used, said methodology can be adapted to the situation of each country. The ENIF 2018 incorporates questions that cover aspects of financial knowledge, behaviors and attitudes in adults from 18 to 70 years of age, where the maximum score obtained is seven, nine and five points for each aspect respectively, which gives a total of 21 points. The index is built from the sum of the points obtained in each aspect. Method: This sum is normalized to 100 to facilitate its interpretation (CNBV, 2019); a higher value implies greater financial literacy and a lower value the opposite. Context of financial education in Mexico The CNBV (2019) indicates that the financial literacy index for Mexico was located at a rating of 58.2 points; when broken down by components, it indicates that "financial knowledge" was located at 65.8 and Results and conclusion: Current Level of Financial Literacy: The level of financial literacy in Mexico has been determined to be relatively low, with a large proportion of the population lacking basic knowledge of financial issues. Impact on Financial Well-being: It has been shown that there is a direct correlation between the level of financial literacy and the economic well-being of individuals, highlighting the importance of improving education in this area to boost financial development and reduce economic insecurity. Demographic Gaps: Certain demographic groups, such as low-income people, youth and women, have been identified as facing greater challenges in terms of financial literacy, underscoring the need to adopt inclusive and targeted approaches to address these disparities. Importance of Financial Education: The relevance of promoting financial education programs from the early stages of life has been highlighted, both in the educational system and through community initiatives, to equip people with the necessary skills to make responsible financial decisions. and prepare them to face future economic challenges. Resarch implications: Awareness of the Importance of the Topic: Conducting research on financial literacy involves recognizing the critical relevance of this topic in today's society. This means understanding how a lack of financial literacy can negatively impact the lives of individuals and communities in terms of economic well-being, access to opportunities, and the ability to make informed decisions. Understanding the Causes and Consequences: The researcher must delve into the underlying causes of the lack of financial literacy, as well as the possible short- and long-term consequences for individuals and society as a whole. This involves analyzing factors such as access to financial education, the quality of the education received, socioeconomic and cultural barriers, among others. Identification of Areas of Improvement: Research can reveal specific areas where improvements are needed in terms of public policies, educational programs, financial services, and business practices. This may include recommendations to develop stronger school curricula, implement financial awareness campaigns, improve the accessibility of financial services, and promote transparency and accountability in the financial industry. Developing Innovative Solutions: By understanding the needs and challenges related to financial literacy, researchers can contribute to the development of innovative and effective solutions. This could involve creating interactive educational tools, designing training programs tailored to different demographic groups, or implementing financial technologies (fintech) that facilitate access to financial services and making informed decisions. Fostering Dialogue and Collaboration: Research can serve as a basis to foster dialogue between different actors, including government institutions, nonprofit organizations, private companies, academics, and civil society. This can lead to strategic collaborations and coordinated actions to address financial literacy challenges more effectively and sustainably.

AB  - This study analyses the effects of financial literacy and digital financial capabilities in shaping entrepreneurs’ preferences for ethical financial intermediaries and sustainable investment decisions. Exploiting novel survey data on Italian micro-enterprises, we find that more financially literate business owners have higher preferences for intermediaries with a strong ethical stance, are more likely to make investments inspired by environmental and social criteria and have a higher awareness of sustainable financial products. Moreover, digital financial competencies are found to play a significant role in enhancing preferences for ethical intermediaries and sustainable investment decisions. Finally, we show that the beneficial effect of financial literacy is mostly direct, while the indirect effect operating through higher digital financial abilities, despite being statistically significant, impacts firms’ sustainable financing and investing decisions only to a lower extent. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: To develop healthcare professionals as clinical leaders in academic medicine and learning health system; and uncover organizational barriers, as well as pathways and practices to facilitate career growth and professional fulfillment. Methods: The Department of Medicine strategic plan efforts prompted the development of a business of medicine program informed by a needs assessment and realignment between academic departments and the healthcare system. The business of medicine leadership program launched in 2017. This descriptive case study presents its 5th year evaluation. Competencies were included from the Physician MBA program and from specific departmental needs and goals. Results: The program hosted a total of 102 clinical faculty. We had a 37% response rate of those retained at Indiana University School of Medicine. Overall, responses conveyed a positive experience in the course. Over 80% of participants felt that they gained skills in professional reflection, professional socialization, goal orientation, critical thinking, and commitment to profession. Financial literacy was overwhelmingly the skill that was reported to be the most valuable. Finance and accounting were mentioned as the most difficult concepts to understand. Familiar concepts included communication, LEAN, and wellness related topics. One hundred percent of participants said they are utilizing the skills gained in this program in their current role and that they would recommend the course to others. Conclusion: Business of medicine courses are more common now with programs describing elements informed by health system operations. However, few programs incorporate aspects of wellness, equity, diversity, inclusion, and health equity. Our program makes the case for multiple ways to develop inclusive leaders through a focused five-month program. It also recognizes that to really impact the learning health system, health professionals need leadership development and leaders suited to work alongside career administrators, all aiming towards a common goal of equitable patient-centered care. © 2024 Sotto-Santiago et al.

AB  - This research examines the impact of an external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, an internal locus of control, and social media on financial well-being, focusing on the mediating role of financial behavior. Financial wellbeing can be improved by reducing the external locus of control, increasing individual financial self-efficacy and financial literacy, and using social media appropriately. Furthermore, the importance of financial behavior is emphasized by the indirect effects of external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, and social media on financial wellbeing. The study features an online survey questionnaire with 438 respondents. The relationships were investigated using PLS-SEM. According to the study’s findings, financial influencers are social media data variables that significantly affect financial behavior. These findings can assist policymakers, and business leaders in understanding the most influential factors affecting Indonesia’s financial wellbeing. Furthermore, the Indonesian government encourages the younger generation to improve its literacy index through public financial education. Research into financial wellbeing is critical because it aligns with the government’s goal of improving the stability and health of the population’s finances. Individuals can maintain financial control, allowing them to meet financial goals, manage unexpected expenses during emergencies, deal with financial problems, and enjoy life. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This study intends to handle the latter gap: different results of the determinants of financial inclusion, i.e., financial literacy, age, income, and education. Furthermore, it applies the quantitative design, examining the statistical hypotheses. Additionally, the snowball sampling method chose the population of female entrepreneurs in Indonesia. Through the survey in 2022, this study effectively obtained one hundred and fifty-two samples and their responses. Furthermore, the logistic regression model and classification matrix analyze the obtained data. According to this study’s measurements of access, savings, and credit accounts (AA, SA, and CA), financial literacy effectively increases the financial inclusion of female entrepreneurs. At the same time, demographic features, i.e., age, income, and education, have a positive effect on these accounts. The classification accuracy of financial literacy towards AA, SA, and CA is 94.1%, 80.3%, and 95.4%, respectively. For age, the accuracy is 72.4% for AA, 81.6% for SA, and 67.1% for CA. For income, the accuracy is 89.5% for AA, 85.5% for SA, and 96.1% for CA. For education, the accuracy is 88.2% for AA, 78.3% for SA, and 94.7% for CA. Considering this evidence, businesswomen must have the financial knowledge to choose access, savings, and credit accounts to sustain and grow their business scope. For this purpose, central and local government support is still vital to assist them. © 2024 Conscientia Beam. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Digital financial literacy is projected to become an increasingly significant part of education in the digital age, both in India and around the world. To create programs to raise the level of financial literacy among people in the digital age, it is essential to measure the level of digital financial literacy among various societal segments. The study aims to provide a validated tool for measuring the digital financial literacy of individuals in developing countries, like India and also to analyze the significance of its key dimensions. Also, the level of DFL among respondents in the National Capital Territory (India) was measured. The study adopted the widely used scale development paradigm provided by Churchill (1979). The empirical data was collected using two online surveys with 145 (N1) and 323 (N2) sample sizes, which were analyzed with factor analysis using International Business Machines (IBM) Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and IBM SPSS Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) statistical software. The proposed digital financial literacy scale consists of twenty-two statements under five key aspects of digital financial literacy, which are: Digital Financial Risk and Control; Basic Digital Financial Knowledge; Advanced Digital Financial Knowledge; Digital Financial Attitude, and Digital Financial Behavior. The proposed Digital Financial Literacy Scale demonstrated sound psychometric properties, encouraging its future usage for assessing the digital financial literacy of individuals. Furthermore, it can help organizations and concerned authorities compare individuals' digital financial literacy levels pre- and post-implementation of Digital Financial Literacy Awareness campaigns. © 2024 Sociedade Portguesa de Estomatologia e Medicina Dentaria.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the level of Indonesian millennials’ financial risk tolerance and the effect of gender, family occupation background, geographical location and financial literacy on financial risk tolerance. This research applies a quantitative approach using primary data that were collected through questionnaires. The sample used for this survey comprises 410 university students from western (Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan) and eastern (Bali, Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, Maluku, Papua) parts of Indonesia. The online survey was distributed to various universities in Indonesia. The one-way ANOVA and multiple regression methods were used for the analysis. The results show that: 1) the level of Indonesian millennials’ risk tolerance is moderate, 2) the level of Indonesian millennials’ financial risk tolerance is different, 3) gender, geographical location and financial literacy significantly affect the financial risk tolerance, and 4) family occupation background does not significantly affect the financial risk tolerance. These findings offer managerial insights into business practices in the financial industry to develop individualized investment portfolios based on investors’ financial risk tolerance. In addition, financial advisors are recommended to offer relatively riskier financial products to millennials from West Indonesia and those with higher financial literacy. © 2023 Conscientia Beam.

AB  - Entrepreneurs manage the capital structure of their start-ups to align the assumption of financial risk with their risk appetite. We focus on the ways in which management control systems (MCS), categorized as financial and non-financial MCS, serve as determinants of financial leverage in start-ups. Of particular interest is the influence of entrepreneurs' financial literacy on this relationship. We test these associations on a sample of business-incubated start-ups by combining survey and archival data. Our results show that financial MCS are negatively associated with financial leverage, unlike non-financial MCS, which are positively related. Entrepreneurs’ financial literacy mitigates the impact of these associations. Overall, our aim is to shed light on how start-ups navigate the trade-off between taking risks and controlling their operations. In addition, we add to the growing literature on the adjustment of financial leverage and the role of MCS and financial literacy in managing such leverage. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This paper presents empirical evidence suggesting that financial literacy moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship between the amount of qualitative business information provided and the success of an equity crowdfunding campaign. Drawing on a sample of 807 equity offerings posted on 26 platforms operating in 6 Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Cyprus, France, Israel, Italy, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates), the findings indicate that higher levels of financial literacy amplify the positive effect of more comprehensive qualitative business information. However, once a qualitative business information threshold is crossed, financial literacy results related to observed negative returns are even more substantial. These results, rooted into the signalling and information overload theoretical frameworks, offer valuable insights for entrepreneurs, platform administrators, investors and policymakers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to describe earnings growth and marketability generated by Islamic banks in Indonesia and to find the effects of a moderated mediation model on the nexus between Islamic financial inclusion and literacy, marketability and earnings growth. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of this research was Islamic commercial banks in Indonesia listed on the Financial Services Authority and Bank Indonesia using time-series data of financial statements from 2014 to 2021. This research was designed using the model of moderated mediation. Findings: Earnings growth experienced by Islamic banks in Indonesia has a positive average value followed by a positive marketability. Based on the significance test, the level of earnings growth is positively affected by marketability. The result indicates that the higher the marketability, the higher the earnings growth of Islamic banks. In a moderated mediation model, the result has found a positive effect on the nexus between inclusion supported by the role of literacy, marketability and earnings growth. It indicates that Islamic financial inclusion moderated purely by the role of literacy enhances Islamic banking marketability so that earnings growth continuously increases. Practical implications: The increase of literacy is an empirically proven way to strengthen market power, so the finding obtained in this research can be feedback from the scheme made by the Indonesian government in supporting the Islamic business and for the corporate area being eager to grow greater and faster in competing and equalizing its power in the banking industry. In addition, this research implies that other countries continuously promote and increase the role of Islamic financial literacy and inclusion to enhance market power and increase the growth in Islamic banking. Originality/value: This research extends the limited scholarly work on the role of Islamic financial literacy and inclusion using a different design from prior studies. The framework of market power theory has been elaborated to find the effect of Islamic financial inclusion supported by the role of literacy on earnings growth through marketability. This research is a trailblazer in testing the nexus model between variables allowing the path analysis using the moderated mediation model. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study investigates the development of service-learning models for business school students in Azerbaijan. Drawing on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this study identifies field projects and financial literacy immersions that benefit society while also promoting partnerships between Azerbaijan’s business schools, Central Bank, and international non-profit organizations. Based on the conceptual framework of Brower (Academy of Management Learning & Education 10:58-76, 2011) and theoretical underpinnings of Kolb (2015), this article develops two service-learning models for business schools in Azerbaijan and presents new corollaries between issues of sustainable community development, service-learning, and experiential learning theory. In one service-learning model, business school students complete a service-oriented consulting project based on real-world assignments from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In a separate service-learning model, business school students partner with the Central Bank of Azerbaijan and Junior Achievement in exerting servant leadership by serving as mentors for Azerbaijan’s schoolchildren in the area of financial literacy. The service-learning models in this study are distinctive and innovative in the context of Azerbaijan, both in terms of management education development and the potential to infuse and teach the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals into the business curricula. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - This article examines the relationship between financial literacy and business interruption (BI) insurance among Italian entrepreneurs. Following an increase in unexpected shocks, such as COVID-19 and geopolitical conflicts, a high level of BI risk is expected to persist, especially among small firms, which play a key role in the Italian economy. Using a Bank of Italy 2021 survey of 1998 non-financial firms with fewer than 10 employees, we show a significant positive association between the level of the entrepreneur’s financial literacy and the purchase of BI insurance. Our results highlight the key role of financial literacy in shaping risk management strategies and are robust to different model specifications, also addressing endogeneity concerns. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Previous studies have shown a connection between financial literacy, financial inclusion, financial statements, MSME performance, and MSME sustainability. The results of the relationship between these variables varied, according to several studies. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate, the impact of financial literacy, financial inclusion, and financial statements on the performance and sustainability of MSME, moderated by the variable of business length. Bandar Lampung, Indonesia is situated in a very advantageous location with regard to the geopolitical constellations at the global, governmental, and regional levels. As a result, 100 MSME actors in Bandar Lampung, Indonesia, were asked to fill out a questionnaire, and the data was then analysed using PLS-SEM. The study found that each of these elements influenced MSME performance and sustainability in a positive way. Moreover, the sustainability of MSMEs is also positively impacted by MSME performance. Furthermore, the length of the business also improves the correlation between these factors. These results imply that business actors are more cognizant of the significance of the accounting process in their operations the longer a business has been in operation. The other findings indicate that the longer a business has been in operation, the more its business development will be influenced by that fact, as a well-established business will typically have more experience and grow more rapidly. © 2024, Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite.

AB  - The topic of women's financial inclusion has gained international attention, and prior research has shown conflicting results about the factors that influence financial inclusion among Rural Women Entrepreneurs (RWE) worldwide. Nonetheless, previous research has seldom examined how women's financial inclusion is impacted by digital financial literacy and Digital Libraries (DLs). An individual with financial literacy is equipped with the information and abilities needed to make wise business choices. The ability of business owners to get the capital they need has a beneficial impact on the expansion of the national economy. Making sure vulnerable populations, including low-income RWEs, have affordable access to suitable financial goods and services is known as financial inclusion. The geographical region under investigation was the southern part of India. The participants in the study were 499 RWE from five different states (Tamilnadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andra Pradesh and Telangana). A total of 259 respondents who used Digital Financial Goods & Services (DFG & S) using DLs and 240 respondents who did not utilize financial services took part in the survey. The statistical analysis compares the revenue of individuals who use DFG&S through DLs and those who do not use DFG & S. The annual savings exhibit a substantial disparity, shown by a T-ratio of 2.684 and a p-value of 0.015, which suggests a noteworthy difference at a significance level of 1.5%. Results indicate that those who answer save more money each year than those who do not react. On the other hand, the wealth parameter exhibits a T-ratio of 1.987 and a p-value of 0.123, indicating no statistically significant wealth disparity between the two respondent groups. © The Research Publication, www.trp.org.in.

AB  - The Nigerian government commenced large scale cash transfer program in 2017. We evaluated the socioeconomic impact of the cash transfer program (CTP) in Nigeria. Across six randomly selected states that had implemented the CTP for at least six months, qualitative inquiries were conducted among beneficiaries and program implementers. We utilized a program impact theory to explore the interaction of cash transfer on socioeconomic outcomes. Data were analysed using deductive and inductive thematic analysis. The CTP in Nigeria showed positive impact on reduction of poverty through new income generation or expansion of existing businesses. Food security was improved by promoting increased food expenditure. CTP increased utilization of health services including facility delivery of pregnancies. The CTP also promoted education by increasing attendance at school while also promoting opportunities for savings and investments. Though the majority of the beneficiaries were women, expenditure decision making on the cash was by men and in a few cases jointly. With the large number of poor and vulnerable persons in Nigeria the findings of the CTP in Nigeria show promise in improving key socioeconomic outcomes across poverty, health and nutrition, education, savings, and investment. Our findings justify the need for expansion of the CTP to more poor and vulnerable households. CTPs in Nigeria should consider implementing educational programs to enhance women’s financial literacy or adjusting the structure of the CTPs to incentivize shared decision-making. Future studies on CTP and its socioeconomic impact should include key metrics to measure the size of the impact. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Halal micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) play an important role in the economy, supporting the rapid development of the world's halal industry. The performance of halal MSMEs is influenced by knowledge management and financial literacy. Based on knowledge-based theory, which focuses on internal factors to explain business strategies, innovation capabilities and risk attitudes can mediate the influence of knowledge management and financial literacy on the performance of halal MSMEs. Data collected using quantitative proximity from a sample of 195 owners of halal MSMEs in Malang Raya, Indonesia, was analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings showed that knowledge management and financial literacy affect the performance of MSMEs. The innovation ability and risk attitude of MSME owners mediate the effects of knowledge management and financial literacy on the performance of MSMEs. When knowledge is managed effectively, it creates unique capabilities that contribute to improved performance through innovation, realized through innovative products, and risk attitude, realized through optimized opportunities. © 2023 Conscientia Beam.

AB  - Purpose: Present study investigated the influence of female descendent entrepreneur's self-compassion on the perceived succession success of small-family businesses (S-FB) with the mediating mechanism of financial literacy. Design/methodology/approach: The primary data was collected from 319 female descendent entrepreneurs who were designated as chairwomen, and managing director positions in their retails sector S-FBs. The purposive sampling technique was used to collect the data. The provided hypotheses are tested using the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. This study followed multiple regression analyses to see the influence of self-compassion (mindfulness, self-isolation, self-judgment and over-identification) on financial literacy and perceived succession success. Findings: The results reveal that female descendent entrepreneurs mindfulness and over-identification significantly increase but self-isolation decreases the likelihood of successful succession transition. Moreover, female descendent entrepreneur's financial literacy increases mindfulness and overidentification while it decreases self-isolation and improves the likelihood of succession success. However, financial literacy does not influence self-judgmental traits and perceived succession success. Practical implications: This study highlights a vital issue, how the financial literacy of female descendent entrepreneurs manages their self-compassion and increases the likelihood of succession success. In addition, it covers a research gap and helps the S-FBs to improve their survival rate by focusing on the descendent entrepreneur's self-compassion and financial literacy. Originality/value: This study contributes to the body of knowledge by emphasizing predictors that influence the successful succession transition to subsequent generations. This study determines the influence of self-compassion of female descendent entrepreneurs on perceived succession success and financial literacy as a mediator by using the self-control theory. The study can be useful to family business consultants, policymakers and family businesses. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The term “i-FinTech” refers to businesses or entrepreneurs that integrate modern, Shariah-compliant technologies with financial services. Nevertheless, MSMEs are typically having lack internal knowledge or poor management, incompetent entrepreneurs, and limited financial resources. The purpose of this research is to analyse if financial literacy elements affect i-FinTech adoption and, in turn, promote sustainable entrepreneurship among Bumiputera SMEs in Selangor, Malaysia. A convenience sample strategy was used to disseminate 1,394 surveys to the Bumiputera entrepreneurs, utilizing a quantitative approach. PLS-SEM and mediation analysis are used to analyse the data. The findings indicate that financial literacy and digital financial literacy have a favorable and significant impact on the adoption of i-Fintech. On the other hand, the adoption of i-Fintech is adversely affected by financial management behavior. Furthermore, this study shows that the relationship between financial literacy and digital financial literacy towards sustainable entrepreneurship is mediated in a complimentary way by the adoption of i-FinTech. This result indicates that Bumiputera business owners that are financially and digitally literate are more likely to use i-FinTech and ultimately make a substantial contribution to sustainable entrepreneurship. The results should improve knowledge of the dynamics between the potential of i-FinTech and sustainable entrepreneurship for researchers, regulators, entrepreneurs, and i-FinTech service providers. It is advised that MSMEs keep using i-FinTech to support their operations in order to minimise the effects of a downturn in the market and maintain seamless operations. © 2024, Econjournals.

AB  - Research on sustainable business models and climate change is the focus of this article, which examines the industry, business and sustainability which has attracted a lot of attention. Because of this, we are investigating the effects of implementing business sustainability capabilities using a multiple-case methodology. An original report on China's small- and medium-sized businesses provided the data for this study that examined the theoretical and empirical relationships between financial literacy, innovation and environmental conservation. We devised a conceptual model to demonstrate the impact of corporate sustainability skills and competencies on climate change. Endogeneity concerns connected to financial literacy, innovation and ecological sustainability necessitate the employment of an instrumental variable for climate change. After adjusting for individual and firm characteristics, we found that financial literacy may substantially impact a company's sustainable business model. The findings suggest that financial literacy may boost company innovations by relieving financial restrictions and enhancing corporate governance, both of which contribute to the development of sustainable businesses that assist in increasing climate change mitigation efforts. On the other hand, innovation has a more significant influence on low-leverage companies. There was also a lot of talk about climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in the business context. This research, therefore, sheds light on how business sustainability capabilities and competencies might improve a company's environmental performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study investigates the factors affecting digital adoption by ultra-micro, micro, and small enterprises (UMSEs) based on a survey of 5035 UMSEs in 17 major provinces in Indonesia. We use the survey data to construct a digital adoption index to evaluate the variations in digital adoption in the five business processes of e-procurement, POS, e-marketing, e-commerce, and digital payment. This index not only identifies whether a firm has adopted digital technology but also considers the dimensions of use to measure the level of adoption more precisely. Using the primary data, we employ a simple regression model, and the results demonstrate that owner demographic characteristics, firm-specific factors, business environment, connectivity infrastructure quality, and culture are associated with disparities in digital adoption by UMSEs. Our findings also reveal a positive and significant correlation between digital adoption on business performance. Based on a two-stage least squares (2SLS) model, we found strong evidence of the impact of digital adoption on UMSE owners’ level of financial literacy. The latter result suggests that improving digital adoption among UMSEs could enhance their financial literacy. Overall, these findings confirm the vital role of digital transformation for UMSEs to achieve growth and competitiveness in the global market, which requires robust support from policymakers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being among businesspersons in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, México. The applied methodology includes confirmatory factor analysis and multiple linear regression models. Our results indicate that financial literacy is related to financial well-being directly through its financial behavior component and inversely through financial attitude. Moreover, financial knowledge was not significantly associated with it. Hence, we propose the following recommendations for businesspeople and entrepreneurs: becoming more involved in healthy financial inclusion and financial literacy practices and inspiring their transition from models focused solely on profits to others considering their self-realization and satisfaction. Its main limitations and implications are the scarcity of data to perform an analysis by industry, its geographical outreach, and its public policy repercussions. Its originality lies in analyzing financial well-being among businesspeople, a topic rarely studied in Mexico. Our conclusions impact the implementation of the financial inclusion policy in Mexico and, therefore, contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas.

AB  - Many households struggled both physically and financially during the COVID-19 crisis. In a time of such uncertainty, one might expect households to respond differently to financial instruments considered risker than others. Given the nature and general feelings around cryptocurrency, we expected there might be differences in how households that owned cryptocurrencies fared during the COVID-19 crisis as compared to those that did not own cryptocurrency. Our research found that cryptocurrency-owning households reported fewer financial challenges during the pandemic than households that did not own cryptocurrency. Specifically, they were less likely to experience food insecurity or miss payments on a variety of bills, including medical expenses and utilities. Crypto households experienced less unemployment, as both the head of the household and the partner more readily adapted to working from home. Crypto households were also less likely to experience death from COVID-19 than their counterparts were. Data from the Federal Reserve’s 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) reveal that cryptocurrency-owning households in fact fared better than those who did not. The linear probability model results hold after correction for data imputation and controlling for financial literacy, willingness to take risks in the short- and long-term, income, wealth, gender, age, education level, work status, and race. These findings suggest a counternarrative to the mainstream opinion of cryptocurrency owners as risk-loving, irrational, retail day traders. This research contributes to the overall literature by showing households working with cryptocurrency make financially savvy decisions and are better off generally than their counterparts. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Despite the significance of business succession in the family firm literature, few studies have paid attention to the role of financial constraints, a common feature of micro and small firms, in entrepreneurs’ succession intention. Using a nationally representative survey of micro and small firms in China, we find that a higher degree of financial constraints significantly strengthens the entrepreneur’s intention of passing the firm on to the next generation. Moreover, the effect of financial constraints works particularly for firms whose entrepreneurs possess lower levels of financial literacy and for firms in regions with less-developed financial markets. Our results still hold after addressing potential endogeneity problems and conducting a wide array of robustness checks. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The rapid growth of digital financial services especially during the COVID-19 outbreak, is a factor accelerating the use of online loan applications that inevitably require the knowledge of digital finance. This study used the behavior change theory and digital financial literacy to identify relevant and correlated variables to confirm positive motivational factors on digital financial skills and capability. Structure equation modeling (SEM) and path analysis were applied to find the correlation and confirm the proposed hypotheses presented. There were 400 samples of small entrepreneurs from different provinces, and online questionnaires were used for data collection. The findings showed that the knowledge and motivation variables were related and had a positive effect. It contributes to continuously building up the skills and capabilities of small entrepreneurs who need to develop their capabilities in digital financial literacy adequately in line with the changes in business and technology after the outbreak of COVID-19. This concept can apply to online loan policy for small entrepreneurs trained with motivating courses who accepted digital finance literacy's usefulness. © 2023

AB  - This research aimed to explore how well managers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Mogadishu, Somalia, understand financial concepts such as savings, managing debt, handling financial risks, and planning for retirement, and how this understanding affects their investment decisions. The background of the study highlights that many SMEs in Mogadishu struggle to sustain their operations, with low profits or failure often due to poor investment choices. To investigate the link between financial literacy and investment decision-making among these managers, the study was based on the principles of modern portfolio theory. The research used a correlational design to analyze data from 250 targeted SMEs, with 154 respondents selected through stratified random sampling. Data collection was facilitated by questionnaires, and the analysis involved calculating means, standard deviations, and conducting regression analysis. The findings indicated that among the financial literacy components, debt management had the most significant impact on investment decisions (β=0.490, p<0.05), followed by financial risk management (β=0.137, p<0.05), and lastly, the ability to save (β=0.128, p<0.05). The study concluded that financial literacy plays a crucial role in influencing investment decisions among SME managers in Mogadishu, suggesting that improving financial knowledge could lead to better business outcomes. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Low-income households are those with lower incomes than most households in the region. In Malaysia, a low-income household earns less than RM 4,500 per month. Savings issues for low-income households are rarely discussed. This is because, logically, how can these low-income households save when their money is barely enough to cover their basic needs? Nonetheless, despite limited research, there is evidence that low-income households save. This study aims to identify the type of savings of low-income households. According to this study, low-income households do save. The methodology used in this study is multinomial logistic regression. The result of the study shows that strata, household size, number of income earners, the ability of households to save, and perception of households in access to higher education are the factors influencing low-income households' savings. This study implies that low-income households face numerous obstacles that make saving difficult, including low-income levels, limited access to financial products and services, and a lack of financial literacy. The term savings is used to describe the sum of money that has been set aside for some unspecified purpose. Money, investments, and other forms of liquid capital are all acceptable. Whether for a down payment on a house, a business start-up, or retirement, savings plays a critical role in a person's finances. Lack of discretionary income is a major obstacle to saving. Many people struggle to save money because they have a lot of debt, low wages, and no idea how to manage their finances. It's also possible. © 2018 Malaysian Consumer and Family Economics Association (MACFEA).

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates how students' propensity towards indebtedness affects their savings behaviour. Additionally, the study examines the moderating role of financial literacy in the relationship between propensity towards indebtedness and savings behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaires were administered to undergraduate students from the University of Ghana Business School. A total of 370 valid responses were used in the empirical analysis. The hypothesised relationships were tested using partial least square – structural equation modelling. Findings: The structural model results suggest that students' propensity towards indebtedness is negatively related to their savings behaviour. Further, the results demonstrate that financial literacy moderates the negative association between students' propensity towards debt and savings behaviour. Originality/value: This study highlights students' propensity towards indebtedness and how it impacts their savings behaviour. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aims to investigate the effects of sector 4.0 technologies, particularly Financial Technology (Fintech), on Sustainable Business Success (SBS) within the Indian garment sector. It aims to analyse the impact of Fintech Integration (IF) and Extent of Financial Knowledge (EFK) on sustainability performance, with a focus on understanding the mediating effect of Financial Accessibility (FA) in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilizes covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) to analyse data collected from 683 enterprises in the Indian garment sector. The theoretical frameworks of Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT) and the Resource-Based View are employed to guide the research. Findings: The investigation reveals that Fintech Integration (IF) and environmental friendliness knowledge significantly impact the promotion and maintenance of sustainability within the Indian garment sector. Moreover, the study highlights the moderating influence of financial Accessibility (FA) on the associations among fintech integration, Extent of Financial Knowledge, and sustainability attainment. Furthermore, sensitivity studies demonstrate that improved financial access positively affects a firm’s sustainability performance. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature by addressing significant knowledge gaps and offering practical insights for managers and policymakers in the Ready-Made Garments (RMG) industry. It provides a comprehensive approach that integrates fintech and financial expertise to enhance credit accessibility and foster long-term viability for enterprises within the Indian garment sector. The originality lies in its holistic perspective, combining technological integration with the Extent of Financial Knowledge to drive sustainability in a specific industrial context, thus providing valuable guidance for industry stakeholders. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - For young people, financial literacy is important because they face financial decisions that can have significant consequences throughout their lives, such as investing in a college education or a business, shopping, buying books or computer games. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between the financial literacy levels of young people and their perceived ICT competence, reading and mathematical literacy, which are measurable and observable phenomena. The research data were obtained from the 2018 PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) database, officially published by the OECD. The participants of this study were 15-year-old students from 15 different countries that participated in the PISA programme in 2018. Mathematical and reading literacy were found to be an important variable affecting the financial literacy performance of young people. However, ICT competencies did not significantly affect the financial literacy performance of young people. Additionally, this study tested the mediating effects of reading literacy, mathematical literacy and perceived ICT competence variables on financial literacy. © 2023 British Educational Research Association.

AB  - In recent years, E-Commerce has experienced a very significant increase. E-commerce provides a broad overview of technology, processes and practices that can be carried out without using paper as a means of transactions. E-commerce can be a solution to the paper waste problem which is an environmental issue that can lead to social problems. Thus, e-commerce has a vital role in achieving business sustainability performance. E-commerce has had a big influence on the social and economic growth of today's society. Business management's ability to manage financial information is an important indicator in influencing Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises’ (MSME's) business performance. Good managements’ financial literacy equips MSMEs with knowledge and skill empowering MSMEs to make informed financial decisions, manage resources effectively and promote sustainable development. This research aims to analyze the relationship between E-Commerce and the sustainability performance of MSMEs and analyze the relationship between financial literacy and its positive and significant relationship with the sustainability performance of MSMEs. The research method uses a descriptive method with a quantitative approach. The population in this research are MSMEs managers in Indonesia who have comprehensive knowledge regarding the operations and performance of MSMEs. In this study, researchers used a simple random sampling technique with a sample size of 478 MSME managers. Data analysis in this research uses the Partial Least Square (PLS) technique which is an alternative method based on the variance of the variables used. The stages of data analysis are validity testing, reliability testing and hypothesis testing. The independent variables in this research are e-commerce and financial literacy, while the dependent variable is MSME sustainability performance. The results of this research show that e-commerce has a positive and significant relationship with MSME sustainability performance and financial literacy has a positive and significant relationship to MSME sustainability performance. In addition, e-commerce has a significant influence on the sustainability performance of MSMEs because the presence of e-commerce is one of the marketing alternatives used to reach more vendors and customers which can change the supply chain leads to social problem solution such as food distribution. Further, e-commerce may minimize traveling long distances for shopping resulting to the carbon footprint reduction. MSMEs have the same opportunity to use e-commerce as an alternative to maximize performance. However, not all MSMEs have the capability to use and utilize e-commerce optimally. After all, knowing good financial management will make it easier to make sustainable decisions since the higher the level of financial literacy, the MSME players can optimize their sustainability performance. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

AB  - Purpose: This qualitative study aims to examine bankers’ perspectives regarding financial inclusion, the challenges it faces and the scope for improvement. This research proposes a financial inclusion model, considering the inputs received by bankers. Financial exclusion of different sections is an issue common to emerging countries. Design/methodology/approach: Data for qualitative research were collected through interviews with bank officials. The information was gathered from 32 bankers from India’s several zones (North, South, West and East). The data were collected from bankers from different public and private sector banks. Thematic analysis was performed up to the point of saturation to study the response received from bankers. Findings: Bank-related issues such as frequent computer problems, network connectivity problems, costs, a shortage of bank branches, fewer transactions through automated teller machines and a shortage of banking staff affect customers’ confidence in formal banking. Banking services are disrupted by a lack of trust in banking correspondents (BCs), as they are not regular employees of banks. Limits on daily transactions discourage high-value customers from using BCs and kiosks. The time spent on administrative formalities impacts customers. Financial inclusion is affected by availability, accessibility, usage and affordability. Digital financial literacy is essential for ease of transaction, but awareness about financial products helps protect customers from cyber scams. The findings of this research would benefit financial institutions globally in developing their businesses and helping to achieve financial inclusion and the United Nation’s sustainable development goals (SDGs). Originality/value: This research paper undertakes a qualitative analysis of the views collected from bankers. Bankers are crucial stakeholders in the successful implementation of the National Financial Inclusion Policy of the Government of India. Bankers’ perspectives will be important not only for India and its researchers but also in the global context, as the UN’s SDGs focus on leaving no one behind. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Even though studies have been conducted in the field of finance to examine the impact of financial literacy on small business performance, there is a lack of clarity regarding the specific mechanisms through which this influence is achieved. This paper seeks to address this gap by investigating the mediating role of financial capability in the relationship between financial literacy and small business performance in the Sekondi-Takoradi Metropolis of Ghana. The study utilizes structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques and employs Smart-PLS 3 software to test the proposed hypotheses. The empirical findings reveal that the association between financial literacy and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) performance is not direct but rather mediated by financial capability. Furthermore, the results indicate that the financial capability of SME owners/managers has a significant impact on their firm's performance. Additionally, the findings support the mediation model, as financial capability also acts as an important mechanism through which financial access influences SME performance. Policymakers, SME operators, and other stakeholders should prioritize the key areas identified by these findings to enhance small business performance in Ghana. © 2024 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of the article is theoretical and methodological substantiation of the state and post-war prospects of financial inclusion in Ukraine, taking into account the experience of EU countries. The objectives of the study are as follows: to theoretically sub-stantiate the content and features of financial inclusion, taking into account the experience of EU countries; to assess the current state of financial inclusion; and to outline post-war prospects for the development of financial inclusion in Ukraine. It is argued that the key parameters of financial inclusion are financial well-being, financial behaviour, financial knowledge, and the utilization of financial products, as well as physical access to financial services. Drawing on the experience of EU countries, it is substantiated that creating conditions for free access to financial services for all categories of the population and businesses, as well as their digitalization, contribute to the growth of citizens' income, the simplification of investment mechanisms, and thus the economic development of the country. An assessment of the state of financial inclusion in Ukraine is conducted through online surveys of various categories of citizens. It is determined that Ukrainians feel a strong need for additional sources of income, and the financial situation of the majority of them is extremely unstable. Based on the results of correlation-regression analysis, the priorities of financial inclusion are identified as the level of financial literacy and competency among the population. This will enable them to budget their income and expenses, promote the transformation of savings into investments, and have a positive impact on the post-war recovery of the country's economy. © 2023 by the author(s).

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to provide and find an alternative solution to achieving literacy indexes and financial inclusion that exceeded the target in 2019. Design/methodology/approach: This research uses a normative research type. Secondary data becomes the primary data and uses the method of qualitative data analysis. Findings: The results showed that public literacy and financial institutions’ inclusion were dependent on public trust in financial institutions. The Financial Services Authorities’ (FSA) arrangement’s weakness lies in the limited scope of the FSA’s authority in carrying out legal actions against unlicensed financial institutions and the low critical power of the community in choosing a credible financial institution. Research limitations/implications: Based on the research findings, results are expected to have implications for the concept of FSA’s authority. Practical implications: Based on the research findings, results are expected to have implications for expanding the FSA’s authority to conduct oversight of financial institutions so that the high literacy and financial inclusion of the public can achieve public welfare. Social implications: The research implication for the community is that the results of this study find weaknesses in the financial literacy and inclusion policies to find the causes of the problems and find solutions to these problems. The practical research implications are for policymakers; research results can be used as a basis for determining solutions to problems in regulations. The results of this study can also have implications for the development of a boy of knowledge in the field of business economic law, especially economic law.

AB  - This study aims to answer the impact of digital financial literacy (DFL) and the demographic factors on digital financial inclusion (DFI). This model employed the independent variables that consist of digital financial literacy and demographic factors including gender, age, occupation, marital status, income. By applying purposive sampling, this study collected the data from 160 households who have minimum one banks’ accounts. To answer the research hypotheses, this study analyzed the data using binary logistic regression that categorized sample into DFI or otherwise. Based on the model fit test, the findings showed that DFL and demographic factors affect DFI. The effect of gender and marital status showed an insignificant effect on DFI. Conversely, DFL and other demographic factors including age, income, occupation significantly explain DFI in Indonesian household. The model can predict 84.4% respondents in a correct classification as DFI or otherwise. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper explored the factors that impact the sustainability and growth of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) in Botswana. A self-administered structured questionnaire was used to survey 348 owners/managers of SMEs in the South Eastern District of Botswana. Descriptive and inferential statistics were generated from the gathered data using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Version 27.0). Findings revealed that entrepreneurial factors, firm-specific factors and exogenous factors impacted the growth and sustainability of manufacturing firms in Botswana. In addition, government policies and guidelines, innovation and creativity, human capital development, access to finance, financial management skills and managerial skills were also confirmed as significantly contributing to the growth and sustainability of manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises in Botswana. Key recommendations derived from these findings include the need for policymakers in the government of Botswana and private sector partners to upskill owners/managers of manufacturing enterprises on business planning, financial management, financial literacy, quality management, and market research skills. Furthermore, efforts should be accelerated to promote products manufactured in Botswana to regional and global markets. © 2024, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to explore the intricate relationship between financial literacy, digital transformation, Fintech adoption, competitiveness and sustainable firm performance, particularly focusing on how financial literacy empowers firms in the evolving digital landscape. Leveraging technological innovation systems (TIS) and resource-based view (RBV), this research suggests a model that incorporates these concepts, focusing on the moderating role of financial literacy in essential interactions. Design/methodology/approach: This study employed a survey-based methodology, collecting data from employees across five major Pakistani banks. The survey yielded 426 responses, from which 387 valid ones were selected for analysis. The analysis utilized partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), complemented by the Hayes Process Model for moderated mediation analysis. This approach ensured robust examination of the relationships between the constructs of the proposed model. Findings: The study's findings validate that digital transformation significantly enhances sustainable performance, with Fintech adoption and competitiveness acting as crucial mediators. Financial literacy is highlighted as a key moderator, influencing the effects of digital transformation on Fintech adoption and competitiveness, although its direct impact on sustainable performance is less pronounced. This comprehensive analysis underscores the complex interplay among these factors in driving sustainable performance in the banking sector. Originality/value: This research enriches the theoretical and practical comprehension of how digital transformation and Fintech integration, underpinned by financial literacy, bolster sustainable business outcomes. It sheds light on the synergy between technology, strategy and organizational success, offering key insights for the banking industry's navigation through the digital era's challenges. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Additionally, business owners’ literacy levels positively influence innovation. Although digitalization shows a positive impact on innovation and financial performance, the lack of statistical significance calls for nuanced exploration. The study contributes to understanding the complex dynamics within MSMEs post-pandemic, emphasizing the importance of literation and innovation. The research offers practical insights for MSME owners on enhancing financial literacy and fostering an innovative culture within their businesses. Policymakers were also encouraged to allocate resources to facilitate financial training for business owners. Urban areas might employ varying pandemic response strategies depending on their economic circumstances, resulting in differences in interaction variables. Future studies should extend these findings to diverse urban settings to broaden our understanding of literation, innovation, and digitalization’s impact on MSME performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the process by which the level of immersion in virtual reality-based behavioral simulation (VR-BS) impacts on the non-cognitive and cognitive outcomes. The cognitive outcome is measured using the increase in the level of Sharia financial literacy, while the noncognitive outcome is measured using the behavioral intention to use VR-BS. Design/methodology/approach: The method consists of two parts: First, the development of VR-BS, in the context of sharia financial literacy, using the waterfall model. Second, testing the effectiveness of VR-BS using the theory of interactive media effects framework. The participants were 142 students from three secondary schools (two Islamic religious schools and one public school) in Yogyakarta and Central Java, Indonesia. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used for testing the hypotheses. Findings: VR-BS creates a perceived coolness and vividness, which in turn has an impact on increasing the participants’ engagement. Also, the use of VR has an impact on natural mapping, which increases a user’s engagement through its perceived ease of use. As predicted, the user’s engagement affects VR’s behavior, mediated by the user’s attitude toward VR media. VR’s interactivity, however, does not impact on the cognitive aspect. Research limitations/implications: The participants were not randomly selected, as the data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the majority of the participants had never tried VR before this study. The participants, however, were digital natives. Practical implications: It is implied from the findings that Islamic financial business actors and the relevant government agencies (e.g. the Indonesian Financial Services Authority [OJK], the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology and the Ministry of Religious Affairs) should collaborate to best prepare the future generation of ummah by using VR-BS in their joint promotion and education programs. The results of the current study reveal that the use of VR-BS may attract people to engage in Islamic financial activities. By engaging in such activities, or at least engaging in real-life simulations/classes/workshops, people may gradually acquire more knowledge about Islamic finance. Originality/value: As predicted, the user’s engagement has an impact on behavior toward VR-BS, which is mediated by attitude toward VR-BS. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study seeks to examine the influence of financial literacy, educational level, information technology, and the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards for small and medium-sized enterprises (FAS SMEs) on the quality of financial reports for restaurant small and medium business enterprises in the Banyumas region of Indonesia. A sample of 100 restaurants was selected from a population of approximately 300 small and medium-sized restaurants using a simple random sampling method with the Slovin’s formula. Data was collected by distributing questionnaires. Out of a total of 300 questionnaires, 100 were received back. Subsequently, the data was subjected to multiple linear regression analysis. Based on the resource-based hypothesis, the findings indicate that the use of information technology and the adoption of FAS SMEs have a beneficial impact on the quality of their financial reports. However, financial literacy and educational level do not have any effect. This study, despite its limited sample size, contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field of financial accounting for SMEs, specifically in emerging countries like Indonesia. It achieves this by offering empirical data on the factors that influence the quality of financial reports for SMEs. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Research background: Retirement planning is viewed as one of the cornerstones of long-term household financial security. The responsibility of retirement planning has now been shifted to the individual and is no longer the responsibility of the employer. Purpose: This paper examines the link between financial literacy and retirement planning among informal sector traders in the Randburg area of Johannesburg, South Africa. Research methodology: A questionnaire approach was used to collect data from 269 randomly selected informal sector respondents. The data was analysed using ordinal regression. Robustness tests were executed using the Wald test. Results: Findings reveal that financial literacy is linked to retirement planning, and especially with reference to informal sector workers. Additionally, education, income and the informal business sector were observed to have a positive and significant influence on retirement planning. Novelty: The paper contributes to both theoretical and practical discourses on retirement planning for informal sector entrepreneurs which has not received much attention. These results are important for policy makers in retirement planning as well as curriculum development.  © 2024 Rudo Gutura et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to analyse the effect of financial literacy and innovation capability on business performance with government support as a mediating variable. Theoretical framework: Government Support as a mediation was analyzed the effect of financial literacy and innovation capability on business performance. Method: A quantitative methods approach was used by distributing questionnaires to 110 Food & Beverage MSME in Jakarta Area. The data collection process was carried out using google form, then analysed using path analysis processed using Smart-PLS. Result: This study found that financial literacy has positive impact on government support but innovation capability has not, then innovation capability and government support have the positive effect on MSME performance, but financial literacy has no impact on MSME performance. The mediation test found that government support mediates the effect of innovation capability and financial literacy on MSME performance. Research, Practical & Social implications: This finding suggests that the government as a regulator should continue to increase its support for MSME actors so as to improve the performance of MSME businesses. This finding encourages MSME actors to have strong instincts in creating and implementing the latest innovations in their business to get government support in improving their business. Originality/value: This study uses 3 business performance indicators using primary data which are usually used in analysing the company's secondary data, with sufficient validity and reliability results, the use of these indicators is also suitable in analysing business performance in primary data. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

AB  - Finance and growth underpin the debate on the implication of financial literacy and financial inclusion for development among scholars. While financial inclusion and financial literacy are positioned as enablers of sustainable development, literature has failed to link the two with sustainable development, especially for rural agrarian dwellers in dire need of financial development attributes. Therefore, this study applied variance-based structural equation modelling to examine the implication of financial literacy and financial inclusion for the sustainable livelihood of rural agrarian settlers in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Global scales were adapted and validated before administering them to 283 farmers and subsistence businesses in the region. The results revealed that financial literacy positively and significantly influences financial inclusion (β = 0.452) and the attainment of sustainable livelihood (β = 0.444). Financial inclusion partially mediates the influence of financial literacy on sustainable livelihood (β = 0.253), as it directly explains the province's sustainable livelihood (β = 0.114). The study's implication informs structured intervention for improving financial literacy to assist the target group with access to requisite funding, which could support their economic activities for a decent living. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper investigates the complex factors hindering entrepreneurial aspirations in Lebanon, focusing on the absence of a functional financial system and its impact on entrepreneurial intentions. Drawing on surveys conducted with 325 Lebanese participants across three generations, using ordinal regression, the research reveals crucial determinants of entrepreneurial intentions, emphasizing the roles of entrepreneurial attitude, the absence of banking sector services, optimism, risk propensity, and age. Positive attitudes and optimism correlate with stronger intentions; however, the weakened economic situation and lack of a functional financial system diminish this positive correlation. Demographic factors like gender and education do not significantly influence intentions. In addition, the study reveals differences in entrepreneurial intentions determinants across the three generations of X, Y, and Z. This study underscores the urgent need for financial system reforms in Lebanon to enhance stability while advocating for financial literacy programs and private sector initiatives to empower entrepreneurs and expand their businesses. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - India has experienced a significant digital payments transformation, driven by technological advancements, smartphone penetration, and government initiatives. This research explores the role of digital payments and mobile payments in India's Fintech revolution. Using an extended technology acceptance model, the study investigates user acceptance and perceived usability. The research identifies factors influencing perceived usefulness, behavioral intention, and actual usage of digital payments. Four constructs—Financial Literacy, Trust and Privacy, Service Quality, and Perceived Ease of Use—are analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results show the growing adoption of digital and mobile payment platforms like Paytm, Google Pay, and PhonePe, even among financially excluded segments. However, financial literacy does not directly impact digital payment acceptance. The study concludes that digital and mobile payments have disrupted the payment landscape in India, bringing efficiency and simplicity. Enhancing financial literacy is crucial for wider adoption. The findings contribute insights for businesses, policymakers, and users in leveraging the benefits of digital and mobile payments during India's Fintech revolution. © 2023 WITPress.

AB  - Consumer fraud is a civil violation of a remedial statute not requiring specific intent to deceive. Most consumer fraud statutes define violations as unconscionable, misleading, or deceptive practices irrespective of intent, in derogation of the principle of caveat emptor. They do not apply to business-to-business transactions. Trust plays a central role in businessto-consumer transactions. Because consumers are individuals, there is often an inherent inequality in consumer transactions. Sophisticated marketing techniques—especially target marketing that follows potential customers all over the internet—hound consumers’ online lives and manipulate purchasing decisions. The increasing monetization of almost everything exacerbates these effects. This transactionalism itself erodes trust because commercial trust is less robust than interpersonal trust. “Consumers” are not a monolithic category and the effects of consumer fraud depend on one’s education, business sophistication, and ethnicity. The neoclassical model of a universal, rational, self-interested, decontextualized individual has numerous limitations, and we now know that rationality is bounded in any event—we are unable to incorporate all relevant information in our decision-making. Further, the neoclassical model does not accurately represent the financial situations and daily realities of most American consumers, who are working to middle class, struggling economically, and lacking in financial literacy. This Essay applies this framework to the phenomenon of home lending fraud, which was the primary cause of the Great Recession and the worldwide financial meltdown of 2008. Home lending fraud of all sorts erodes trust in our system and country. Trust tends to be eroded more in consumers who do not realize the risks taken when entering into these transactions, which is disproportionally the case with lower income consumers. They are hit especially hard because they have fewer resources, and if they own a home, it is generally their only valuable asset. In this Essay, I focus particularly on the example of land contracts—rent-to-own arrangements often accompanied by predatory features—that have looted many millions of dollars of wealth from low-to moderate-income Americans. The Essay finally turns to the post-Great Recession Dodd–Frank Act and its creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Bureau is the first federal agency with the sole mission to regulate consumer financial products. Dodd–Frank regulations and oversight have helped increase trust in consumer financial markets since the last financial crisis. Supervision of lending institutions—some of which were not previously subject to federal regulation—is a critical tool in resisting forces that continue to undermine trust in our system. © 2023 by Linda E.

AB  - This study aims to create a theoretical model of business sustainability with financial literacy antecedents. The antecedents of financial literacy are intellectual capital and risk attitudes. The research location is in the province of East Java, Indonesia. Batik SMEs are only found in Indonesia because it is a cultural heritage belonging to Indonesia that does not exist in other countries. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling, with 222 respondents from the batik SMEs spread across six cities. The data was taken using a questionnaire on a Likert scale. Data analysis uses SEM (structural equation modeling) with the SmartPLS application. The study results show that risk attitudes toward financial literacy have a positive effect. The effect of financial literacy on the business sustainability of the batik industry has a positive influence. The impact of intellectual capital on the business sustainability of the batik industry has a positive effect. Risk attitudes have no significant positive impact on business sustainability. Financial literacy has yet to be able to mediate intellectual capital's influence on the batik SME's business sustainability. This needs to be explored further with further research. Furthermore, financial literacy can mediate risk attitudes towards the business sustainability of batik SMEs.  © 2023 Ahmad Idris et al.

AB  - Agro-based small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are currently receiving top priority among policymakers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations due to their great contribution to employment and GDP growth. This study examines the impact of financial literacy on the sustainable competitive performance of agro-based SMEs, with a focus on the mediating role of access to digital finance and the moderating role of business experience. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), we analysed data from 345 SME owner-managers. The results indicate that financial literacy positively affects sustainable competitive performance, with access to digital finance serving as a significant mediator. However, business experience does not moderate the relationship between financial literacy and access to digital finance. These findings suggest that improving financial literacy and enhancing digital finance access are critical for the sustainable development of agro-based SMEs in the SAARC region. © The authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on small businesses, significantly influencing entrepreneurial aspirations and presenting numerous challenges. This calls for additional research into perceptions, intentions, and the challenges faced in this context. This study aims to explore the comprehension of key entrepreneurial concepts among business students in the post-pandemic era. The paper presents an empirical study which employs qualitative in-depth interviews with 34 undergraduate business students from one public university in the Midwest of the United States. The findings reveal a complex view of entrepreneurship that extends beyond traditional business creation, encompassing elements of social innovation and personal fulfillment. Students displayed a generally positive attitude towards entrepreneurship, influenced strongly by their involvement in practical entrepreneurship-related activities and their familial backgrounds. However, they also identified significant barriers, including financial constraints, fear of failure, and a lack of practical experience, which hinder their intentions to pursue entrepreneurial ventures. The study underscores the importance of entrepreneurship education programs incorporating more comprehensive practical experiences, enhancing financial literacy, and providing psychological support to overcome these challenges. These insights contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to effectively support and prepare aspiring entrepreneurs in a changing educational landscape. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - Financial competences are essential in the tourism industry and consequently are valued in hiring and promotion decisions. However, according to the literature, tourism graduates appear to have inadequate levels of financial skills. The perceived lack of required competences results in a competitive disadvantage for tourism graduates in favour of those who studied Management & Business Administration, or equivalent degrees. To explain this gap, some authors point to the scarcity of finance-related courses within the curriculum of most of tourism or hospitality programs, but it is also suggested that the characteristics of the students enrolling in tourism and hospitality degrees could play a relevant role, highlighting that those students lack the required background knowledge and attitudes resulting in major constraints for financial competences development. Our study compares the levels of financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, numeracy, and financial interest of entry-level students enrolled in these two competing university degrees, Tourism and Management & Business Administration. Our results indicate significant differences in both variables that in addition to the scarcity of finance subjects in the tourism curriculum could affect the students’ prospects and employability. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: The main purpose of this paper is to establish the mediating effect of credit counselling in the relationship between access to microcredit and survival of micro small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa post COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modelling (SEM) through SmartPLS 4.0 was used to generate the standardized parameters to test whether credit counselling mediates the relationship between access to microcredit and survival of MSMEs in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa post COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda. Findings: The SEM bootstrap results revealed that credit counselling enhances access to microcredit by 27% to promote survival of MSMEs in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa post COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda. Research limitations: The current study focused only on women MSMEs. Future studies may possibly collect data from all the MSMEs to draw better generalization of the findings within the sector. Practical implications: The findings can help public finance policy to ensure provision of credit counselling to microentrepreneurs who borrow from different financial institutions to reduce the problem of loan defaults and delinquency rampant in lending. This could be done through conducting routine business education and counselling sessions for microentrepreneurs who often need credit to grow their businesses. Originality/value: This study is amongst the first few studies to establish the mediating effect of credit counselling in the relationship between access to microcredit and survival of MSMEs in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda. There is a dearth in literature and theory on the rehabilitative and preventive role of credit counselling in reducing repayment defaults amongst borrowers within the credit market to spur survival of MSMEs seen as the main enabler of economic growth, especially in developing countries. In fact, credit counselling acts as a safety net by substituting financial literacy and education to solve the rampant problem of overindebtedness amongst borrowers who are debt illiterate within the credit market. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The study focused on the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs at the Galerías Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia, from 2019 to 2023. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the paper is empirical-analytical, focusing on the tangible and unique aspects of reality that can be fragmented for measurement. This approach privileges the use of data from the study population’s experience, which is treated analytically through statistics to establish frequencies and correlations between variables. The research involved a structured questionnaire based on bibliographic references and considering the operational framework of the variables, which underwent expert review, necessary adjustments, a pilot test and subsequent validation in 2019 and 2023. The reliability of the instrument was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, ensuring a reliable indicator when equal to or greater than 0.7 in each analysis period. This methodology aimed to identify practices and how the financial profile influences short term. Findings: The findings from the survey conducted with the microentrepreneurs at Galerías Shopping Center reveal several significant connections to the theoretical framework. The study revealed that many microentrepreneurs relied on their personal funds for business financing, indicating a limited understanding of financial principles. Additionally, a significant portion of microentrepreneurs mitigated investment risk by securing loans from financial institutions, yet none utilized government subsidies like entrepreneurship loans, pointing to a lack of advice. The findings underscore the importance of financial education and suitable financial services for business development. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this study is the lack of detailed data on the financial structure of microentrepreneurs' businesses, as well as specific information on interest rates and the terms and conditions of the microcredit used. These limitations may affect the generalization of the results and the comprehensive understanding of the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs. Future research could include a larger sample size and more accurate data on the financial structure of businesses, as well as a detailed investigation of interest rates and terms and conditions of microcredit, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the financial impacts for microentrepreneurs. Practical implications: The findings of this study have practical implications for microentrepreneurs in the Galerías Shopping Center. The research emphasizes the need for improved financial knowledge, accounting practices and debt management among microentrepreneurs. It also highlights the importance of financial education and access to suitable financial services for business development. The study’s insights can guide the development of training programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing financial literacy and financial management among microentrepreneurs, leading to more informed decision-making and improved financial outcomes. Social implications: From a social perspective, this research contributes to promoting economic development and financial inclusion. By addressing the mismanagement of microcredit by microentrepreneurs and providing insights into their short-term finances, the study aims to foster economic empowerment and sustainable development within communities. The findings underscore the significance of microfinance in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. The research emphasizes the importance of equitable access to financial services, which can contribute to narrowing the gap between the financially excluded population and the conventional financial system. Originality/value: This research adds originality and value to the academic community by addressing the incidence of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs in the specific context of the Galerías Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia. By characterizing the financial profile of microentrepreneurs, establishing the relationship between microcredit characteristics and the financial profile and proposing an action plan, the study provides valuable insights for decision-making in both the academic and microfinance fields. The research contributes to the existing literature on microfinance and financial inclusion, offering a unique perspective and potential solutions for optimizing the use of microcredit-funded resources by microentrepreneurs. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Financing capital investments and working capital have been the key challenges for small businesses during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. Excessive indebtedness can increase the fragility of firms, particularly during times of uncertainty. While there are several programs globally that target entrepreneurs' financial literacy, most of them do not take into consideration entrepreneurs' financial resilience during and after crisis times such as pandemics. The objective of this paper is to discuss the status of financial literacy programs targeting entrepreneurs. This paper conducts a review of the relevant literature to establish the initial understanding and then generates a framework consisting of entrepreneurs' financial literacy along with its components. This is done by carrying out qualitative content analysis of the various financial literacy initiatives targeting entrepreneurs in twenty countries globally to understand their target segments, scope, initiating organisations and limitations. The paper then suggests a framework for entrepreneurs' financial education that takes into consideration financial resilience during and after crisis situations in general and pandemics in particular. © 2023 Malaysian Economic Association.

AB  - Achieving financial security becomes one of the main tasks of the government, business management, investors and citizens. However, at the same time, the very comprehen-sion of the essence of such security is ambiguous, as well as the mechanism for achieving it. The purpose of the article is to identify the trends and key areas of financial security research by conducting a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications that are indexed in the Scopus database. A thorough review of the evolution of financial security research was conducted from 1951 to March 2023. 2,515 publications indexed in the Scopus that contain the term "financial security" in their titles, abstracts and keywords were analyzed. The VOSviewer software was used to build network maps of the relationship between keywords, visualize the relationships between scholars from different countries, and build a network map of the relationship between keywords in chronolog-ical order. The results showed that since the beginning of the 90s of the 20th century, the number of publications on financial security has been increasing annually; the term "financial security" is used in the research of various fields of science; the majority of publications on financial security appeared between 2014 and 2020. The leadership of such research belongs to the USA, the United Kingdom and China. Visualization of the network map of common words based on bibliographic data allowed us to single out 11 clusters that characterize the key areas of financial security research. The following keywords were identified in each cluster: employment security, financial efficiency and stability, life safety, financial risks, social security, financial technologies, psychological state, economic security, family and personal security, financial literacy, and the covid-19 pandemic. The obtained results will contribute to a better understanding of global trends by researchers as well as promote future research in the field of financial security. © 2023 by the author(s).

AB  - In a context of market volatility, the growing complexity of financial products, and a shift towards self-employment, there is an increasing demand for inclusive financial services for sole traders and micro-organizations. To address this need, we conducted a study using real-time data from a Fintech lender in the Czech Republic to assess the effectiveness of a new financial literacy based psychometric credit scoring model (PSM) in improving access to finance for micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSME) sector, particularly sole traders, and micro-organizations, during volatile market conditions. This study affirms that PSMs play a significant role in responsibly including this underserved sector. Specifically, we observed a 30% higher approval rate and a 23% lower default rate when utilizing the PSM versus the traditional credit scoring model (TCSM). Moreover, during the period of substantial market volatility and instability, such as the state-of-emergency during the COVID-19 pandemic, the PSM exhibited a 13% higher approval rate at a 20% lower default rate than the TCSM. This evidence supports the proposition that PSMs offer a viable option for promoting financial inclusion and targeted financial education among MSMEs in the face of instable financial markets. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Indonesia stands as a colossus in the digital payment frontier, boasting the largest market in Southeast Asia with a staggering 92 million users in 2020 alone and a transaction value eclipsing 18.7 billion US dollars. It’s within this vibrant backdrop that our research unravels the enigma of Gen Z, the digital-native cohort swiftly commandeering these platforms. Riding the wave of e-Wallet domination, with over 70 service providers and an impressive 104 million users, our findings dive deep into the pulsating core of Gen Z’s behaviors. At the intersection of culture and commerce, we discover that cultural nuances, notably acceptance of inequality and collectivism, significantly sculpt their brand allegiance. Concurrently, a superior customer experience emerges as a pivotal anchor for their loyalty. Yet, the shimmering digital horizon reveals disparities: a discernible gender imbalance and concerning gaps in financial literacy among these young consumers. For forward-thinking businesses, the clarion call is unmistakable: to triumph in the Indonesian market, one must deftly navigate its cultural tapestry, elevate customer experiences, and champion financial literacy. This study doesn’t just decode the Gen Z phenomenon in Indonesia but illuminates the roadmap for businesses to thrive in the heart of Southeast Asia’s digital payment behemoth. © 2023, Editura Lumen.

AB  - This study’s purpose is to assess the influence of small and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs) budgeting skills on loan repayment in South Africa. The quantitative research approach was selected as the appropriate methodology for this study, while the purposive sampling approach was selected as the appropriate way to select participants for this study. The primary data for this study came from respondents who were business owners of SMEs in the retail, hardware, construction, and manufacturing industries. SPSS was used to analyze the acquired data. A total of 380 research questionnaires were distributed, and there were 375 that were returned for analysis (which gives a response rate of 99%). Both a regression analysis and a correlation analysis using Pearson’s method were carried out. Pearson’s correlation coefficient revealed a positive and significant relationship between SMEs’ budgeting skills and loan repayment at the level of r =.250, p < 0.0005. These results were supported by the finding that there is a positive and significant association between these two factors. According to the findings of the study, it is recommended that financial providers educate their SMEs on how to prepare various types of budgets, how to follow up and compare their financial objectives to their performance, and that financial institutions and government organizations should assist SMEs with budgeting skills to decrease SME loan defaults. © Thabiso Sthembiso Msomi, 2024.

AB  - Entrepreneurship has become a central issue in an effort to improve the nation’s economic welfare. Several previous studies agree that the ideal country is one that has an entrepreneurial contribution of at least 4% of its total population. However, when compared with other countries, Indonesia’s entrepreneurial contribution is currently still low because it has only reached an entrepreneurial ratio of 3.47%. One of the causes of this low contribution is the lack of effective entrepreneurship education. Some empirical evidence has not been able to explain how entrepreneurship education is able to prepare generation Z to become entrepreneurs through various new literacies. This research aims to investigate the influence of entrepreneurship education on the entrepreneurial readiness of generation Z students, which is moderated by digital business literacy and financial literacy. This research was conducted using a quantitative approach and involved 700 students in Makassar City, Indonesia. The data analysis technique used is partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis. Research findings show that entrepreneurship education plays an important role in the entrepreneurial readiness of generation Z students, which is strengthened by digital business literacy and financial literacy. The findings of this research can help expand and develop concepts related to digital business literacy and financial literacy in the context of entrepreneurship education in higher education, so that, by implication, this research provides a valuable contribution to entrepreneurship education, which paves the way for further research regarding entrepreneurial readiness in the context of diverse higher education through various other new literacies. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of financial literacy on financial well-being among the business school faculties. Both the variables (financial literacy and financial well-being) are operationalized as multi-dimensional constructs to undertake the study. Moreover, the paper also endeavored to examine the mediating role of financial self-efficacy between financial literacy and financial well-being. The paper adopts a survey by questionnaire method to gather data from 203 business school faculty members through the simple random sampling (SRS) technique. Confirmatory factor analysis was used for scale validation, and structural equation modeling was used for hypotheses testing. Mediation was tested using percentile bootstrap with a 95% confidence interval. The study found a significantly positive impact of financial literacy as well as its dimensions on financial self-efficacy and financial well-being. It was also found that financial self-efficacy partially mediates the effect of financial literacy on financial well-being. Measurement of the constructs was done on subjective measures, and the study is limited to business school faculties only. The present research findings could be employed in crafting educational programs for business schools. These programs shall guide such institutions in imparting the knowledge and skills among students regarding their personal finances in terms of savings and retirement planning. The study was focused on the business school faculties of the Jammu and Kashmir region, who are less exposed to the financial literacy programs due to factors like frequent lockdown and internet shutdowns. Moreover, it is generally witnessed that salaried class people in Jammu and Kashmir pay less attention to long-term financial planning for retirement, which makes the present study more relevant. Therefore, this study will prove beneficial to all the employees, especially the business school faculties, to understand the importance of financial literacy and its subsequent effect on financial well-being. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2022.

AB  - Developing financial literacy is a crucial part of entrepreneurship. It can aid aspiring entrepreneurs to learn how to analyze market trends, formulate business plans, conduct cost accounting activities, and navigate fiscal risks in their businesses. Therefore, we investigated the most recent dataset on rural residents in China to determine the effects of financial literacy on their entrepreneurial behaviors. Our observations reveal that individuals with high financial literacy, that is, those who have attained advanced financial knowledge, are more likely to start a business than those with low financial literacy. We employed instrumental variable analysis to mitigate the endogeneity of financial literacy. Results show a causal relationship between Chinese rural residents’ financial literacy and entrepreneurship. Finally, we demonstrate that the aggressive risk attitudes of rural families magnify the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurship. © 2024

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between financial literacy, financial technology, and financial inclusion and the business performance of SMEs in Malang Raya, Indonesia. Looking at various cases related to financial progress, all of which are turning to technology to ensure time efficiency, there is a need for further development related to research on financial technology, and financial inclusion for SMEs' business performance in Malang Raya. The analysis in this study used bibliometrics and PLS. Bibliometrics is used to find relationships that will later become new things. Before the bibliometric analysis, this research looked for references to research through Publish or Perish, so more than 200 reputable journals based on electronics were found in accordance with this study. Furthermore, filters related to the scope are more specifically related to financial technology and the inclusion of SMEs' performance. So fintech is being discovered as a novelty between financial literacy and financial inclusion. The second analysis examines the influence of financial literacy, financial technology, and, financial inclusion on the business performance of SMEs. The results of this study using PLS show that financial literacy has a positive and significant effect on the business performance of SMEs. Financial technology does not affect SMEs' business performance, and lastly, financial inclusion has a positive and significant effect on SMEs' business performance. The limitation of this study is related to the object of research that still focuses on Malang Raya. © 2023 Conscientia Beam. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian–Ukrainian war have had a significant impact on economies around the world, with pivotal implications for the activities of companies. The issue of corporate financial literacy has been within our scope of interest for a matter of years now, and this study aims at re-enforcing our previous overall theoretical and literacy-based analysis from a methodological approach. We use our own previous databases to explore and analyze the importance of corporate financial literacy, taking into account the economic factors inside and outside the organization that affect the businesses. For this, a confirmative factor analysis (CFA) model has been created. The article aims at two things with this. On the one hand, we intend to introduce the wider scope of the fit tests applicable in the CFA, thus giving a direction to other authors. It also allows for adequate verification for their models, while at the same time conducting the fit test for our corporate financial literacy model as well as a valid model framework suitable for making measurements and deductions. With the resulting model, this paper aims to examine the corporate financial literacy, the current economic challenges, and the issues faced by managers during crises. In addition to all this, with our article, we also want to make some contribution to the methodology of empirical data analysis: in the article we collect the fit tests that can be used to validate confirmatory factor models, the way they are determined, and most importantly, we try to sort out the literature approaches to the acceptable values of these tests, giving the reader a kind of guide and a reference base. The results of the research identify response measures that can contribute to increasing companies’ resilience based on the principles of financial awareness. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) contribute to the economy's health. To preserve their businesses, owners or managers are required to not only attempt various means to achieve their sales target but also to ensure optimal financial management. Business decision-making is related to financial decisions, which indicates the need for financial management understanding and skills. The research is a survey study, and data are collected from owners and managers of the MSMEs. This study aims to obtain a depiction of MSMEs’ financial inclusion. The study also explores the antecedents of financial literacy, which ultimately determines the MSMEs' financial inclusion. The study’s findings indicate that financial communication, information, and attitudes toward money affect MSMEs’ financial literacy. The study’s results also confirm the impact of financial literacy on MSMEs' financial inclusion. © 2024 GMP Press and Printing.

AB  - Businesses have been exposed to various challenges during the global pandemic. Unfortunately, the financially vulnerable groups in society are disproportionately affected by such a difficult time. Therefore, it is important for businesses to recognise this when creating new business models for sustainable corporate management. This paper attempts to (1) identify the factors that affect individual financial vulnerability, (2) develop survey items to assess financial vulnerability and its factors and (3) provide the characteristics of financially vulnerable groups by presenting a complete set of descriptive statistics. The results can help to create more inclusive business models that are better equipped to address the challenges ahead. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted with collaboration with an NGO that provides a financial counselling service in Hong Kong. In total, 338 valid responses were collected and the data were used to characterise financially vulnerable groups in terms of (1) change in financial conditions due to COVID-19; (2) exposure to digitised financial services and related push marketing; (3) financial management ability; (4) changes in four financial behaviours and (5) financial vulnerability as measured according to the debt/service ratio. Results show that the respondents have a median debt/service ratio of 0.513, which represents an unsustainable level of debt. Around ¼ of surveyed respondents reported that their debt/service ratio was 1 or even higher, indicating obvious difficulties in meeting financial obligations. A total of 36.7% of the respondents reported worsening financial conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19. The results presented provide a solid empirical set of data that will help future research work to examine and/or develop a heuristic financial vulnerability model that incorporates the key factors leading to it. Businesses can refer to them when creating new business models that are sustainable, able to meet corporate social responsibility goals and can achieve several targets/goals of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Grounded in upper echelon (UE) theory, this study aims to examine the role of managerial competencies (business experience, financial literacy and digital literacy) in sustainable development strategy, with resource management as a mediator. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical data collection is conducted through a survey completed by 297 top management teams of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in Pakistan. Structural equation modelling in Smart PLS is used to substantiate the hypotheses. Findings: The findings reveal that financially and digitally literate managers significantly contribute to the sustainable development strategies of SMEs. However, experienced managers do not focus significantly on sustainable development strategies. Resource management partially mediates the nexus between financial literacy and sustainable development strategy, as well as between digital literacy and sustainable development strategy. In contrast, resource management does not mediate the nexus between business experience and sustainable development strategy. Research limitations/implications: This study recommends that SMEs should prioritize managers with digital and financial literacy over those with experience. SMEs led by a management team with digital and financial literacy are more effective in resource management for sustainable development practices, whereas experienced managers may not significantly prioritize managing resources for sustainability. Originality/value: While research based on the UE theory significantly contributes to the body of knowledge on sustainable development, the role of managerial competencies, particularly business experience, financial literacy and digital literacy, in sustainable development strategy via resource management is neglected. This research fills this gap in the context of UE theory and thereby enriches the literature. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The main aim of this study is to explore the probable impact of audit committee (AC) features (AC size, AC independence, AC meetings, and AC financial expertise) on firm performance of listed firms in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. This empirical investigation uses a sample of 281 listed firms in the six GCC countries representing 1124 firm-year observations for a period of four financial periods (2019-2022). Findings from both Hierarchical Multiple Regression models suggest that only two out of four independent variables (AC independence and AC financial expertise) explain the firm performance of listed firms in GCC countries. This study makes a valuable contribution to the existing literature by offering a comprehensive analysis of the influence of AC existence and its specific features on firm performance, drawing insights from agency theory and resource dependence theory. By examining these relationships, the study enhances our understanding of the mechanisms through which AC characteristics can impact a firm's success. The findings of this study hold practical implications for businesses and investors. By understanding the impact of AC characteristics on firm performance, businesses can make informed decisions when structuring their audit committees. They can prioritize specific features or attributes that have been found to positively influence firm performance, such as independence, expertise, and financial literacy of AC members. This knowledge can guide businesses in optimizing their governance structures and enhancing their overall performance. The results can be used as a guide by governments and other regulatory bodies for drafting rules pertaining to corporate governance (CG) codes, particularly those that deal with AC creation. © 2024, Czestochowa University of Technology.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between corporate asset intensity and the readability of 10-K forms within the U.S. lodging industry over the period 1994–2020. Using OLS regressions, the study reveals that as a company's asset intensity decreases, so does the readability of its 10-K form. Additionally, we show that this relationship has become more pronounced since 1998 and is stronger for larger companies or those in the hotel industry. These results suggest that, in light of ongoing discussions and policies surrounding the readability of financial statements, companies produce more comprehensible documentation when their business operations are less specialized. This finding indicates that companies that need to address a more diverse investor base try to be as understandable as possible. This should also lead to social implications in terms of enhanced transparency, improved financial literacy, investor confidence, and a positive impact on corporate responsibility for stakeholders. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Manuscript type: Literature review Research aims: This study aims to identify research trends in theoretical models of financial literacy in the Scopus database from 2013 to 2021. Future research can focus on the least-used variables in theoretical models of financial literacy. Design/Methodology/Approach: Seventy-three articles using theoretical models of financial literacy are discussed in this study. This paper uses bibliometric analysis to visualise the bibliographic coupling, co-citation, and co-occurrence of keywords. Research findings: An increasing number of articles on financial literacy models have been published in the Scopus database, suggesting a growing interest in theoretical models of financial literacy and financial literacy knowledge. Performance, competitive advantage and business experience are increasingly being used as variables, indicating an opportunity to further investigate financial literacy models. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study is the first to investigate theoretical models of financial literacy using bibliometric analysis and a literature review. This study focuses on articles published between 2013 to 2021. Practitioner/Policy implication: This study is important because it connects previous and more recent studies, identifies gaps in understanding, and suggests new ways to study theoretical models of financial literacy. Research limitations/Implications: The material used in this study was only taken from the Scopus database. Therefore, further research needs to be done by including indexing and other databases. © 2023, Faculty of Business and Economics,University of Malaya. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research methodology: This case is based on primary data collected via interviews with the CEO of the company. The authors obtained the case release form to publish this case. Case overview/synopsis: Various stakeholders, regulators, environmental activists and public awareness have increased companies’ pressure to contribute to environmental issues. However, the pressure seems to be more on large-scale companies to make progress and have an elaborate vision and goals related to environmental issues than small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This case deals with the sustainability focus of the CEO of Ruscombe Artisan Food & Drink Ltd. (Made for Drink), an SME in the UK with a voluntary environmental impact investment proposal under consideration while having losses since 2017. The case integrates the financial aspects and environmental considerations into this strategic investment evaluation process for making a capital investment decision. The case provides the actual financials of the company, including the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement of the company since its inception in 2017. The case information enables students to comprehend and evaluate the consequences of doing a voluntary environmental capital investment project. The students will have the opportunity to apply simple capital investment methods and consider the external and less tangible environmental benefits in their final decision-making. Complexity academic level: The case is suitable for undergraduate accounting or management modules, mainly introductory modules such as Managing Financial Resources, International Accounting, Finance, Introductory Corporate Finance, Basic Financial Literacy and Entrepreneurship. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: In this case study, the authors aimed to investigate the usefulness of five interactive workshops on leadership skills relevant to academic physicians for their professional fulfillment. Workshops were led by experts in finance, negotiation, business administration and digital tools and enhanced a practical understanding of skills in 1) financial investment; 2) growing clout on social media; 3) negotiation; 4) navigating institutional culture as a woman; and 5) conflict management. Design/methodology/approach: Workshops were deployed to faculty in the departments of Radiology and Psychiatry. Attendance at seminars was captured, categorized as in-person (when offered), virtual-live or virtual-recording views post hoc. The authors also collected responses to a brief, 5-question survey which assessed faculty familiarity with the topic pre-and post-seminar and evaluated the perceived relevance of the topic to professional fulfillment. Findings: The highest attendance was for the seminar on financial investments, and the lowest attendance was for that on conflict management. The seminar that the highest proportion of respondents deemed important as a leadership skill was on the topic of navigating institutional culture as a woman in the workplace. The seminar that focused on cultivating clout on social media was the seminar that the highest proportion of respondents deemed worth attending. Originality/value: From this case study, the authors learned that financial literacy, discerning institutional culture, managing conflicts, negotiating and using digital tools are topics which have relevance to physician professional fulfillment. Such topics could be valuable as the building blocks for future programs which provide leadership training to physicians. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) account for the vast majority of firms in most economies, particularly in developing nations, and are key contributors to job creation and global economic development. However, the most significant impediment to MSME development in low- and middle-income countries is a lack of access to both investment and working capital financing. Due to a lack of essential track record, appropriate collateral, and credit history, MSMEs are frequently denied business loans by traditional lending institutions. In addition, SMEs’ inability to access funding is hindered by institutional, structural, and non-financial factors. To address this, both the public and private sectors employ indirect and direct finance interventions to help MSMEs in developing and emerging economies enhance and increase their financing needs. Given the importance of MSMEs in the economy, a comprehensive overview of and systematic synthesizing of the evidence of the effects of financial access interventions for MSMEs, capturing a wide variety of outcome variables, is useful. Objectives: The objective of this evidence and gap map (EGM) is to describe the existing evidence on the effects of various interventions dedicated to supporting and improving MSMEs’ access to credit, as well as the corresponding firm performance and/or welfare outcomes. Methods: An EGM is a systematic evidence product that displays the existing evidence relevant to a specific research question. An EGM's end product is a research article or report, but it can also be shared via an interactive map drawn as a matrix of included studies and their corresponding interventions and outcomes. Interventions in low- and middle-income countries that target specific population subgroups are included on the map. The EGM considers five types of interventions: (i) strategy, legislation and regulatory; (ii) systems and institutions; (iii) facilitate access; (iv) lending instruments or financial products; and (v) demand-side interventions. The map, on the other hand, covers outcome domains for policy environment, financial inclusion, firm performance, and welfare. Impact evaluations or systematic reviews of relevant interventions for a previously defined target population are included in the EGM. Studies using experimental or non-experimental designs, as well as systematic reviews, are eligible. The EGM excludes before-and-after study designs with no suitable comparison group. Furthermore, the map excludes literature reviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and descriptive analyses. Search strings were used to conduct electronic searches in databases. To ensure that the research team had identified a significant portion of relevant research works, the search strategy was supplemented with gray literature searches and systematic review citation tracking. We have compiled studies that are either completed or in progress. For practical reasons, studies are limited to papers written in English and are not restricted by publication date. Selection Criteria: We included studies that examined interventions to enhance MSMEs’ access to finance in low- and middle-income countries targeting MSMEs including households, smallholder farmers and single person enterprise as well as financial institutions/agencies and their staff. The EGM considers five types of interventions that aim to: (i) deliver strategy, legislation, and regulatory aspects; (ii) systems and institutions that enable financing; (iii) facilitate access to finance; (iv) deliver different lending instruments or financial products, including traditional forms of microcredit; and (v) demand-side interventions such as programs on financial literacy. The map includes outcome domains surrounding policy environment, financial inclusion, firm performance, and welfare. Eligible studies must be experimental, non-experimental, or systematic reviews. In addition, the study designs must have a suitable comparison group before and after the implementation of interventions. Results: The EGM includes 413 studies. The majority of the studies (379 studies) analyzed microenterprises, such as households and smallholder farmers; 7 studies analyzed community groups; while 109 studies analyzed small and medium enterprises. There were 147 studies on interventions that targeted multiple firm sizes. Lending instruments/financial products are the most common intervention across all firm types. When it comes to the types of firms that receive the said financial intervention, the data is overwhelmingly in favor of microenterprises (278 studies), followed by systems and organizations (138 studies) that support better access to such financial products and services. Welfare outcomes have the most evidence out of all of the outcomes of interest, followed by firm performance and financial inclusion. Among all firm types, welfare outcomes are primarily targeted at microenterprises. With 59 studies, we can say that small businesses have a significantly large number of enterprise performance outcomes. of the 413 studies, 243 used non-experimental or quasi-experimental designs (mainly propensity score matching and instrumental variable approaches), 136 used experimental methods, and 34 were systematic reviews. 175 studies (43%) provided evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa, 142 studies (35%) from South Asia, 86 studies (21%) from East Asia and the Pacific, 66 studies (16%) from Latin America and the Caribbean, 28 studies (7%), Europe and Central Asia, and 21 studies (5%) from the Middle East and North Africa. Most of the included evidence covers low-income (26%) and lower-middle income countries (66%), and to a lesser extent upper-middle-income countries (26%). Conclusion: This map depicts the existing evidence and gaps on the effects of interventions to enhance MSMEs’ access to financial services in low and middle-income countries. Interventions directed at microenterprises with welfare outcomes have a significant number of research outcomes in the literature. SME evaluations have looked at firm performance, with less focus to employment and the welfare effects on owners and employees, including poverty reduction. Microcredit/loans have been the focus of a large number of research papers (238 studies), indicating the field's growing popularity. However, emerging financial interventions such as facilitating access to digital financial services are relatively under-studied. Several studies also investigate rural or population in remote areas with 192 studies, 126 studies on poor and disadvantaged, and 114 papers on women. Most of the research is conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa (175 studies) and South Asia (142 studies) so further research in other regions could be conducted to allow a more holistic understanding of the effects of financial inclusion interventions. Credit lines, supply chain finance, and trade financing, which are some of the ADB's financial tools have limited evidence. Future studies should look into strategy, law, and regulation interventions, as well as interventions targeted at SMEs, and examine policy and regulatory environment outcomes as well as welfare outcomes. Interventions on the demand side and their impact on the policy and regulatory environment, as well as facilitating access are relatively understudied. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Traditional agricultural training programs often fall short in cultivating the comprehensive entrepreneurial skill set necessary for navigating the challenges of modern organic farming. Moreover, the potential synergies between community-based learning approaches and design thinking principles in agricultural education are yet to be fully explored. This study investigates the impact of a training approach integrating community-based learning and design thinking to enhance entrepreneurship competencies among organic farmers in Khon Kaen province, Thailand. Using a quasi-experimental design involving sixty participants, the study employs pre- and post-training assessments to evaluate changes in entrepreneurship competencies, including innovation, risk management, business planning, and financial literacy. Preliminary findings indicate significant improvements in all competency areas post-training, highlighting the potential of combining the two approaches in agricultural education. This research contributes to the broader goals of sustainable agriculture and rural development in Thailand, offering insights for educators, policymakers, and practitioners aiming to empower the organic farming community. ©Authors.

AB  - Recent and ongoing advancements in the field of ICT have led to the introduction of increasingly diversified financial products, and their use is improving people’s level of financial knowledge and skills. This article aims at assessing the effect of Fintech on the level of financial literacy of small business’ managers in Cameroon. To this end, information was gathered using a questionnaire from 209 small business managers in Cameroon. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), and multiple linear regression are used. Results lead to two main conclusions. On the one hand, unlike knowledge of their existence, the frequency of use of Fintech tools is better able to contribute to improving financial literacy levels overall. On the other hand, specifically, this result is of increased importance when it comes to competence and self-confidence in managing financial affairs. As a result, increasing the utilization of financial technology instruments in companies is imperative for efficiency. © 2024 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.

AB  - This study analysed the effect of credit on the poverty status of roasted plantain vendors in Calabar, Nigeria. The study described sources of credit, comparing the poverty status of credit recipients versus non-recipients, and the relationship between credit access and poverty index alongside the relationship between socioeconomic factors and poverty index. Data was collected from 110 randomly sampled roasted plantain vendors with the use of structured questionnaire. Poverty was measured with the Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) model class of weighted poverty measures. Descriptive statistics were used to examine poverty status, access to credit and the sociodemographic attributes of the roasted plantain vendors. Next, using descriptive statistics, the poverty status of the vendors who accessed credit was compared to those who did not access credit. Finally, the association between access to credit and poverty index was analyzed with logistic regression model while adjusting for the effects of sociodemographic factors. Descriptive statistics showed that 60% of the vendors were female, the average age was 35 years, and the average household size was four persons. Precisely, 91% of the roasted plantain vendors had completed primary or higher education. Exactly, 64.5% received credit, while 30.79% reported non-institutional lenders as sources of credit. The mean monthly income was N48,036.36 (US$116.89). Poverty incidence was lower among credit recipients (0.268) compared to non-recipients (0.487). Credit access (OR =.083, p<.01) and household (OR=2.496, p<.01) had statistically significant associations with the poverty index. Policies promoting structural transformation are recommended for sustainable financial inclusion. An effective economic growth and development program, for example, will increase productive capacities and reduce capital losses, increase creditworthiness, motivate capital expansion and sustainable growth. Also, it was recommended that cooperative formation among the vendors is required. Membership of such a cooperative will increase credit access through reduced transaction cost, higher group’s creditworthiness/borrowing experience and stronger negotiation capacity. A Nigerian economic transformation program to promote increased productive capacities and reduced capital losses is necessary for any financial inclusion policies to sustainably alleviate poverty among deprived agro-processors such as the roasted plantain vendors. Such programs will include financial literacy including banking and loan repayments, business innovations, and business plan development. © (2024), (African Scholarly Science Communications Trust (ASSCAT)).

AB  - The study models inter-relationship among key enablers that influence the growth of FinTechs that offer credit services to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It focuses on emerging market of India, which is the world’s third-largest FinTech centre. It employs Grey DEMATEL method to measure the cause-effect relationship based on the assessment given by FinTech practitioners, experts, policymakers, and investors. The results show that credit demand by SME borrowers, availability of alternate data sources, and Covid-19 are the critical enablers that exercise strong impact on FinTech system. Collaboration between FinTechs and traditional financial institutions, end-to-end financial solutions, and scalability of business operations are recognized as critical dependents that are hugely affected by others. The study recommends policymakers to foster collaborative environment, strengthen digital data landscape, and improve financial literacy to develop FinTech sector. It recommends practitioners to focus on data security and to offer end-to-end financial solutions to its SME borrowers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Institute of Applied Informatics at University of Leipzig.

AB  - The development of halal tourism in Indonesia is the focus of the Indonesian government and MSMEs have an important role in supporting the development of halal tourism in Indonesia. This study aims to examine the relationship between marketing communication and Islamic financial literacy on Islamic financial inclusion and MSME performance in the halal-tourism sector. A covariance-based SEM technique utilizing LISREL software was used to analyze the data from this investigation. Nonprobability sampling was employed to collect the data, and the sample consists of 152 halal-tourism entrepreneurs. This study found a positive and significant association between Islamic financial inclusion and business performance. This study also found that there is a positive and significant association between Islamic financial literacy and Islamic financial inclusion. Marketing communication and Islamic financial inclusion have a positive relationship, but it is insignificant. This study implies that to establish a halal-tourist ecosystem for long-term development in Indonesia, commercial actors must lend their full support. This study demonstrates that they can thrive when MSMEs in the halal-tourist ecosystem are backed by Islamic banking and Islamic rural banks. As a result, a more accommodating approach from Islamic banking is required to provide access to halal finance for business actors in Indonesia’s halal-tourism ecosystem. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In spite of the devastating effects of COVID-19 on businesses, many SMEs have demonstrated resilience and continued on with their operations. This study investigates the determinants of SMEs’ business resilience in Malaysia and Indonesia, with a focus on the moderating factor of technology adoption. The Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, the Dynamic Capability View Theory (DCV), and the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework were combined to analyze a set of business resilience-impacting factors in each country. Online surveys with respondents were used to gather data. Partial least squares-based structural equation modeling was used to examine a total of 539 respondents, of whom 335 were from Indonesia and 204 were from Malaysia. The results showed that government support, technological use, and compliance costs have a significant direct impact on the business resilience of SMEs in both countries. Notably, it was discovered that there were insignificant effects from financial resources and financial literacy. The association between financial resources and business resilience in Indonesia and the relationship between government support and business resilience in Malaysia are both negatively moderated by technology adoption. The findings of this study contributed to a multigroup analysis between neighboring countries, offering valuable insights on the factors influencing SMEs’ business resilience to withstand the COVID-19 crisis and their subsequent recovery. It helps explain how SMEs cope with the epidemic, use government support, and use technology to adapt to the changing business climate. These findings enabled SMEs and governments to use preparation and resilience methods to anticipate future difficulties. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This study explores the nexus between digital financial inclusion and household participation in commercial insurance, utilizing data from the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index and the 2018 CFPS database. Using Probit and Logit models, our research uncovers significant regional and risk -preference variations, emphasizing the influence of governance mechanisms. The study underscores the pivotal role of digital participation in a sustainable governance mechanism in shaping financial behavior, as well as the importance of advocating for regulatory interventions, enhanced financial literacy, and infrastructure development to foster equitable insurance access. Moreover, positive determinants, such as education level and social insurance participation, are identified, while discretionary spending emerges as a barrier. This study advocates for expedited digital financial inclusion initiatives to increase financial literacy with strengthened regulatory oversight and governance mechanisms which would ensure sustainable regional development and insurance market resilience. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to make an exploratory analysis of the impact of the entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) as defined by Acs et al. (2014) on opportunity-driven senior entrepreneurial activity in Latin America. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute of five Latin America countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico), providing a total of 15,019 observations of people that are 50+ years old, between the years 2013 and 2017. A multi-level logistic regression model was used to estimate the relation between the total entrepreneurial activity by opportunity of seniors and some EE indicators. A total of three equations were estimated on the data set described. Findings: This research confirms the relevance of some elements of EE on senior entrepreneurship in Latin America. Entrepreneurial attitudes have a positive relationship with senior entrepreneurs, generating higher levels of entrepreneurial ventures. The combination of institutions that support these attitudes on the EE enhances senior entrepreneurial activity. It also demonstrates that a higher level of entrepreneurial education at postschool stages is relevant to increasing senior entrepreneurial activity. Originality/value: This research makes some interesting contributions in the field of measuring the impact of EE on senior entrepreneurship by opportunity in developing countries, filling a literature gap. It allows us to glimpse some measures that policymakers could take to improve the entrepreneurial activity of this segment in the region, such as implementing programs that facilitate networking opportunities and mentorship, along with providing training in business and financial literacy. © 2024, Alfonso Torres-Marín, José Ernesto Amorós, Marcelo Leporati and Sergio Roses.

AB  - South Africa imposed lockdown level five to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Businesses and shops had to close, adding to the hardships because of the lockout. Furthermore, employees chose to stay at home because of the lack of notice, resulting in job losses. Many people nowadays stay at home to do activities like surfing social media and watching videos online. Users can contact businesses via the Internet, but not all of them can be trusted. When people go shopping, they frequently overestimate their needs and end up spending more money than they should. The idea that purchasers are influenced by variables outside of the store when making purchases is one of the more dated beliefs about consumer behaviour that is still applicable today. The conceptualisation of this literary work is informed by both the Uses and Gratification Theory and the Hawkins Stern‘s Theory of Impulsive Purchases. Using a quantitative method and convenient sampling, this study evaluated how people's purchasing patterns were altered because of the lockdown. A total of 384 people volunteered to participate in the study. The results collected were computed with the use of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, and Microsoft Excel was used for data analysis. The study concluded that, despite the shutdown, South Africans are not easily swayed by social media influence. The study recommended that, to mitigate the negative effects of social media‘s influence on people‘s spending of money during the lockdown, the community needs to collaborate with the Communications and Marketing Division of the University of Zululand and organise a seminar by the community leaders involving the municipality of the selected rural area. However, financial entities should be consulted to educate consumers on financial literacy. Consumers should be encouraged to avoid overdependence on social media. © 2024 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The primary aim is to renew academic discourse on financial education in business families. It emphasizes the need for effective financial literacy programs to foster a healthier relationship with money, addressing both technical aspects of finance and its psychological and relational impacts among family members. Design/methodology/approach: This perspective article explores the impact of money education within business families. It discusses the psychological effects of money education on family dynamics and decision-making in family businesses. The research draws on previous studies, surveys and practical examples to highlight the importance of financial education and its implications on family and business sustainability. Findings: Financial education is essential in business families as it enables more meaningful discussions on money and wealth, fostering informed decisions and decreasing conflict. Yet, it is often overlooked. There is a need for academic research into effective strategies for financial education for family members and the effects of financial literacy, or its absence, on various aspects of the business and the family system. The article presents a selection of pertinent questions for future research in this domain. Originality/value: This article contributes to the family business field by underscoring the gap in scholarly research on money education within family businesses. It advocates for comprehensive financial education strategies that balance technical knowledge with an understanding of the psychological and relational aspects of money. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The issue of culture is becoming ever more interesting, especially when interconnected with other business factors like finance. Although intriguing, the relationship between culture and finance has long been neglected. Unlike existing research, this article aims at assessing the impact of culture on financial inclusion and financial literacy among Cameroonian small business managers. In this quantitative investigation, the indices are built using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the estimation is done using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The data used is from a research survey on 161 small enterprises in the cities of Douala, Bafoussam, Foumban, Foumbot, and Dschang. The findings demonstrate that organizational culture, in contrast to its social component, is positively and strongly associated with financial literacy and financial inclusion. Additionally, firm and manager variables like age, turnover variation, and education level significantly explain these financial variables. Thus, it is essential to promote organizational culture in Cameroonian businesses. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Financial inclusion (FI) relates to the access and availability of financial services to society, especially in low-income groups. FI is pivotal in achieving 7 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This paper explores the level of FI in the rural areas of Maharashtra and measures the impact of FI on the social conditions of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) prevalent in these areas. The study is based on a 424 SHGs survey conducted in the Pune, Thane, and Palghar districts of Maharashtra, India. The impact of FI on SHGs is evaluated using a Structural Equation Model (SEM). The results of the study show that physical banking services, Business Facilitators (BFs), and Business Correspondents (BCs) improve the social conditions of rural SHGs. Additionally, BCs and BFs mediate the relationship between physical banking services and social conditions. The study also reveals an insignificant association between BCs and BFs and insurance services. The present study highlights the importance of increasing the awareness of insurance policies through financial literacy programs and making timely availability and accessibility of BCs and BFs to enhance financial inclusion in rural areas. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Although Islamic banks offer superior financial services than other interest-based conventional banks, they could not expand their share and dominate the markets in several Islamic countries. This problem could be attributed to some causes not addressed. The current study proposes Islamic financial literacy as an important factor that could help aggress this problem. Due to a wide variety of Islamic financial services and the lack of understanding of these services, the banks' small business customers are indifferent between Islamic and interested-based conventional services to finance their business. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the exploratory technique of multiple correspondence analysis to detect any potential role of Islamic financial literacy in customers' preference for Islamic banks over conventional ones. The potential effect was tested with other essential factors, such as the customers' age, gender, and educational level. This analysis was conducted on a data set from 2061 banks' small businesses customers using the mall-intercept survey method. Findings: The study shows a low level of Islamic financial literacy among Yemeni banks' small business owners' customers. Furthermore, despite integrating some critical factors that could influence the actual bank selection process among Yemini banks' customers, the authors found a decisive potential role of Islamic financial literacy as one of the key determinants of bank selection preferences. Originality/value: This is the first paper to explore the potential role of Islamic financial literacy on the actual selection between Islamic Banks and their counterparts: the conventional banks in Yemen. The research results could build a more comprehensive theoretical model on Islamic banks' customer behavior. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Digital transformation remains a passion. Globally, science and technology are transforming businesses to make them more competitive and conducive to sustainable development. However, rapid advancements in financial technology have enabled financial institutions to steal customers from traditional banks, resulting in their demise. Consequently, this study employs the System GMM-two step estimator and data from 118 Chinese banks from 2014 to 2021 investigate the issue. Empirical evidence suggests that banks’ digital transformation has a negative impact on their profitability to some extent, but digital inclusive finance has enabled the bank to change its digital transformation behavior and enhance its operational performance. Therefore, banks must continue to strengthen their digital transformation by expanding online customer services, increasing the use of e-accounts and mobile applications, providing digital offline services, strengthening digital risk management and privacy and security controls, reducing customer psychological risk, and promoting financial inclusion. Financial inclusion should simultaneously achieve reduced financial exclusion of customers and increased financial literacy of customers. All these factors will help banks to maintain profitability by leveraging synergies with financial inclusion in the process of digital transformation. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Using a representative survey of Dutch entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals, (i) we measure their subjective financial knowledge and the extent to which they ask for advice when managing their companies, and (ii) we examine whether subjective financial knowledge and the demand for advice are related to the firm economic performance. We find that the respondents feel more comfortable with accounting subjects than they do with strategic ones, of which they feel that they know the least. Entrepreneurs with a greater extent of financial knowledge are more likely to report a higher gross margin and higher revenue growth for their firm. These entrepreneurs are also less likely to seek advice and to delegate financial decisions. Seeking professional advice does not increase the likelihood of an entrepreneur having better performance. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs’ degree of financial knowledge is related to the success of their businesses, while seeking advice is not significantly correlated with better firm performance. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - It is vital to understand Saving Behavior at an individual level, since an individual member of society initiates capital accumulation / mobilization. Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) have been provided credit facilities solely as a source of financing for a long time, but there has been increasing concern lately that MSEs require not only credit but also savings that have risen to the top of the financial services for this market. Micro and small business owners, however, often struggle to save, even if they have surpluses. This is attributed to the lack of incorporation of cognitive factors, financial indiscipline and lack of vision. This study examines the moderating effect of self-control on the relationship between financial literacy and saving behavior using cross-sectional data from 395 micro and small business owners in Kampala, Uganda.The study used a quantitative, positivist research approach. Process macro was used as a statistical tool for analyzing the data gathered using a questionnaire. The study was guided by the social cognitive theory. Results indicate that both financial literacy and self-control significantly predict saving behavior. Besides, the relationship between financial literacy and saving behavior is moderated by self-control. Furthermore, the findings suggest that individuals with low self-control require a lot of financial literacy in order to have a positive effect on their savings behavior relative to those with high self-control because even though they go through financial literacy training, its effect on savings behavior would be negligible. This means that first evaluation of their self-control levels is required before individuals are taken for financial literacy training. Therefore it is advised to determine the self-control of an individual before they are taken for training in financial literacy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Financial literacy is generally seen as an important factor explaining a broader set of investment behaviors. In the context of a weak financial knowledge in France, this article focuses on the particular situation of Generation Z (individuals born after 1995) and more particularly management students likely to be involved in financial decisions in the near future. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a survey conducted in the Fall of 2019, through a questionnaire distributed to 300 students enrolled in a French business school. Findings: The results indicate that financial knowledge is poor for students who do not follow a specialized course in finance. This research also demonstrates the importance of risk behavior, showing that risk adverse students are also those with the lowest level of financial literacy. Originality/value: This article contributes to the academic literature by focusing on students in France. It is the first study to examine Gen Z financial literacy and its implications. It raises awareness on the importance of financial education in the education curriculum. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Lampung is one of the provinces that makes a major contribution to the Indonesian economy. The aim was to investigate the relationship between financial literacy and risk aversion on financial performance with innovative behavior as the mediating variable. The population were the SMEs in Lampung and a sample of 284 were selected. Structural equation modeling was used to test the research hypothesis. The research findings show that financial literacy had a positive direct effect on financial performance (β =. 27, p =. 006), risk aversion had a positive direct effect on financial performance (β =. 21, p =. 000), risk aversion, which had a positive direct effect on innovative behavior (β=. 16, p =. 005). Financial literacy was found to had a positive direct effect on innovative behavior (β =. 73, p =. 000); and innovative behavior had a positive direct effect on financial performance (β =. 39, p =. 000). When innovative behavior entered the relationship between financial literacy and financial performance, the direct effect (β =. 04, p =. 000) was significant. When innovative behavior was introduced into the link between risk aversion and financial success, the direct effect was significant (β =. 34, p =. 01). As a result, innovative behavior is regarded as a moderator of financial literacy and risk aversion on financial performance. This study elaborates on the ways that SME owners can improve their financial success by enhancing their financial literacy and embracing innovative behaviors that will ultimately benefit their business. © (2023), All Rights Reserved.

AB  - As financial technology and consumer behavior in Indonesia evolve, research that assesses their level of risk in debt management is required. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between personality traits and other factors, such as effective financial decision making, attitude toward debt, locus of control, and financial literacy, in influencing a person's response in unexpected situations and causing them into debt, as a lot happened when covid-19 hit. Our data from an online questionnaire revealed that personality has a significant relationship to risk in debt management; additionally, attitude toward debt and financial behavior significantly affect debt risk. This analysis was obtained through ordinal regression by categorizing respondents into three categories: low, middle, and high-risk debt management. This study has potentially implementation for lenders such as banks or peer-to-peer businesses, regarding the type of people who are most likely to have debt troubles, and also regulators regarding how they can make policies related to borrowing applicants to avoid risky debtor in order to push the non-performing loan (NPL) low.

AB  - The growing popularity of smartphones and the proliferation of technology have accelerated the development of the digital payment industry. Fintech enables customers to access financial services more efficiently and faster than traditional business, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic due to health protocols, including restrictions on physical contact. This study investigates financial literacy, fintech adoption, and the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the financial health of consumers in Vietnam. The relatively higher level of the unbanked population in Vietnam and the lower level of adult financial literacy compared with the ASEAN region motivated this study. Based on judgment sampling, participants were approached using the mall intercept technique, and those familiar with fintech were selected for the research interview. Thirty participants were interviewed and were given a survey form to be filled online using their mobile phones. Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS software version 23. Perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, brand image, government support, user innovativeness, and attitude are found to be significantly correlated with fintech adoption in Vietnam, while financial literacy was found to be not significantly correlated with fintech adoption. Furthermore, further analysis using multiple linear regression revealed user innovativeness and attitude have a positive impact towards fintech adoption, and in contrast, financial literacy showed significant negative impact on fintech. This inverse relationship could indicate that in Vietnam, fintech may play a role of bringing financial inclusion where people with lower financial literacy are able to use technology for financial transactions, which was previ-ously inaccessible to them. This could also mean that Vietnamese with higher financial literacy do not see fintech as an important tool for their financial transactions, as they may already have strong access to traditional financial facilities. This research contributes to knowledge in the field of Fintech adoption in Vietnam at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak. To foster greater financial inclusivity and access for the Vietnamese consumers, policy makers could promote the development of fintech business infrastructure and regulatory sandboxes to foster fintech startups. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: An understanding of financial literacy is important not only for business actors but also for individuals and households; even there is a need to introduce this all-important skill to children early. There is a projection that the financial behavior of the young generation will have a better influence on the global economy than that of the previous generation. Therefore, it is crucial that today’s young generation understands financial literacy. This study aims to measure how digital financial literacy and financial confidence can influence both the financial behavior and financial well-being of the younger generation. Design/methodology/approach: The participants in this study are university students from all over Indonesia. This is a quantitative research project that uses online questionnaires, and the collected data is processed using structural equations mode-partial least squares (SEM-PLS) with the Smart-PLS application. Questionnaires have been distributed and obtained by 353 respondents to be processed by the Smart-PLS application. Finding: The result indicates that digital financial literacy has a significant effect on financial behavior, and financial behavior also has a significant effect on financial well-being. Meanwhile, financial confidence influences both financial well-being and financial behavior. Conclusion: This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing information to the public about the importance of digital financial literacy for individuals to control their financial behaviour amidst the rapid growth of financial technology. Furthermore, the research findings are enriched with literature on digital financial literacy, which is still rarely studied. However, a limitation of this study is the fact that the respondents are mainly women. Therefore, there should be further research involving a higher number of respondents and covering a wider research location. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The study investigates how financial literacy and financial capabilities influence small firms’ sustainability in Lagos and Ogun States, Nigeria. It employs a survey research design to collect data from 300 small business owners across the two States. Data collected were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique. The study shows that environmental sustainability, financial sustainability and social responsibility are significant determinants of small firms’ sustainability in Nigeria. Financial literacy and financial capabilities practices also have a significant positive impact on firm sustainability. However, the use of savings product shows a significant adverse effect on firms’ sustainability. The findings imply that financial literacy knowledge and practice in small business operations enhance firms’ sustainability. The study recommends that small firms should incorporate sustainability models into their business operations and improve their financial knowledge to maintain sustainability. Small business owners should also invest their savings in an appropriate investment product that suits their risk tolerance. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper assesses the impact of an integrated skills training program given to youth aged 17–25-year-old living under the $2/day poverty line in the cocoa belt region of Ghana. Despite being a leading producer of cocoa and having a burgeoning youth population, it is estimated that the average age of a cocoa farmer in Ghana is greater than 50 years. To introduce young people to cocoa farming and address the potential barriers they face in order to do that; a multi-faceted skills training programme was designed with the ultimate aim of improving and diversifying youth livelihoods. The training had three key components: i) cocoa academies (which includes agricultural practices; life skills and financial literacy); ii) business incubators (including entrepreneurial training, networks, mentoring) and iii) supporting enabling environment (access to land and finance). Combining quasi-experimental methods Propensity Score Matching with Difference in Differences, we estimate the causal effect of the programme on agricultural outcomes (farming, agricultural practices), financial behaviour outcomes (saving practices, mobile banking) and livelihood outcomes (employment, income, poverty likelihood) one year after the completion of training. The results of the impact evaluation suggest that compared to the control group (youth non-participants), youths who participated in the training adopt better agricultural practices (26 percentage points (pp)), cultivate cocoa (24 pp), and are more likely to engage in farming (22 pp). We also find a 28.7% increase in income in the last seven days and hours worked by 12.4%. Youth also increase the use of banks for saving (16 pp), save using mobile money (6.7 pp), the use of Village Savings and Loan Associations (1.7 pp) and, in general, the use of mobile money for both sending and receiving transfers (10.6 pp). The sex-disaggregated sub-sample analysis provides other valuable insights on the intervention. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The main purpose of this research is the estimation and analysis of the level of Financial Literacy of professionals oriented to business management. The sample was composed of young executives starting MBA studies. The level of FL was analyzed in detail through various statistical techniques, under two perspectives. The first perspective referred to the dimensions involved in the definition of FL and the second referred to the demographic characteristics of the population. Theresults show a level of FL that does not reach an acceptable minimum in its global measurement; neither in its different dimensions, but the Information dimension. In general terms, this result is reproduced at the different demographic segments analyzed. In terms of the demographic categories, there were no differences in age or gender. Based on the income level, there were differences in the Knowledge and Information dimensions. Likewise, based on the number of dependents and on profession, there were differences in the Consciousness dimension. The results allow us to make two important conjectures for further research: the Financial Duality and the Financial Divergence conjectures. It is postulated that the Financial Duality conjecture could be explained through Kahneman’s theory of System 1/System 2 and corresponding behavioral biases. © 2023 by Cherkas Global University All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to analyze the effect of the Finlite mobile app on the financial literacy of undergraduate business students in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a quasi-experimental pre-intervention design. The data are collected using a quiz and a questionnaire. Cluster sampling is adopted for three different zones in Malaysia. A total of 400 business students enrolled in economics courses participated in the intervention. Findings: The results indicate that Finlite significantly promotes students’ savings intentions, practices, decision-making, accountability, values and financial literacy. All results are analyzed based on gender and race. However, Finlite does not significantly help overcome students’ financial issues such as credit card debt and poor spending behavior. Practical implications: Financial literacy may be efficiently promoted through digital tools integrated into economics courses. Young adults can make optimal financial decisions after graduation. Future research should explore different courses, addressing undergraduate and high-school students. Originality/value: Previous studies predominantly examine attitudes and behaviors related to financial literacy. In contrast, this study measures the ex post impact of the Finlite mobile app on savings intentions, practices, decision-making, accountability, ability to overcome financial issues and value for money. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper expands on financial literacy, access to digital finance, and SME performance in the Central Region of Ghana. First, the study analysed SMEs’ digital platform knowledge and utilisation. It examined the relationship between financial literacy, access to digital finance, and SME performance. The paper discussed the mediating influence of access to digital finance on SMEs’ financial literacy and performance. The study employed the quantitative research approach. Using the purposive sampling technique, a total of 400 responses were gathered from SMEs in Cape Coast, Mankessim, Assin Fosu, Agona Swedru, and Kasoa. The study used self-administered questionnaires to collect data. SPSS was employed to evaluate descriptive statistics. Results show that SMEs in the study areas use Mobile Money more than any other digital platform. PLS-SEM was used to investigate the relationship between financial literacy, digital finance, and SME performance. It was found that financial literacy positively affects access to digital finance. Also, access to digital finance improved performance. Access to digital finance mediates the relationship between financial literacy and SME performance. Access to digital finance is as crucial as financial literacy for increasing performance. Therefore, using digital platforms to trade would boost business performance. Digital trading platform providers should improve advertising and make their systems user-friendly. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Financial illiteracy could pose a significant challenge to micro-entrepreneurs. There is a pressing need to foster financial literacy;, therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine particularly how Islamic financial literacy may enhance their businesses toward achieving financial sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quantitative methods. Three hundred (300) questionnaires were distributed to micro-entrepreneurs in three states in Malaysia, namely, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu. This study used the partial least squares (PLS) analysis using the SmartPLS 3.2. Findings: The study found that the most robust Islamic financial literacy factors are financial behavior, followed by financial knowledge and financial attitude.The outcome of Islamic financial literacy, which is financial sustainability, also demonstrates a positive and significant relationship. Social implications: All variables show a positive and significant relationship toward financial sustainability. Stated differently, micro-entrepreneurs are aware that understanding the basic concepts of Islamic finance may help them achieve long-term financial sustainability Originality/value: This study incorporates Islamic financial concepts into financial literacy while also assessing demographic aspects like years of business operation and education as moderators, which were not considered by previous studies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose - Investigating the realities of financial and managerial accounting in a select number of small businesses is the goal of this essay. The purpose of this study is to learn more about small company owners' perceptions and knowledge of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). From the owner's viewpoint, it is specifically investigated what financial data is gathered, how it is used or not to make business choices, and assesses the success of the small business owners, as well as the part the accountant plays in the process. Methodology/approach - This exploratory investigation is grounded in a phenomenological paradigm. The owners of 10 small business owners participated in semi-structured interviews with the goal of better understanding organizational behavior as opposed to theory and textbook practice. Findings - The in-depth examination found a very limited comprehension of accounting information and issues with the financial literacy of these small business owners, and the qualitative data confirmed earlier studies in other nations. The main method for evaluating company success was an informal evaluation, such as how much cash was in the bank since accounting reports were not often made or utilized. Although some company owners sought out more comprehensive business guidance, accountants were engaged for tax services. Originality/value - It becomes clearer why there could be a discrepancy between the language of textbooks and the reality of accounting practice in small business owners. The implication of this is that small business owners' financial management practices need to be better described in accounting textbooks. © 2023, Journal for ReAttach Therapy and Developmental Diversities.

AB  - Investment awareness enables people to make sound and effective decisions in their investment activities. It is evident that many individuals were unsuccessful in managing their investment efficiently. Thus, this study aims to be pioneering among its kind to explore and examine the determinants of investment awareness. To achieve this purpose, we develop a comprehensive quantitative model that investigates the impact of the most essential and suggested drivers of investment awareness (i.e., financial literacy, spending patterns, self-control, saving behavior, attitude toward risk, and family financial socialization). Using convenience sampling, an online questionnaire (using five-point Likert scales) was distributed to a sample of students representing the young generation aged between 18–35 years old from the School of Business and Applied College at King Faisal University. To ratify the validity and reliability of the questionnaire, a pilot test was carried out. For analyzing and interpreting that data, we utilized partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The reported results of 409 responses show that financial literacy, self-control, saving behavior, and family financial socialization have positive and significant influences on investment awareness. Conversely, spending patterns and attitude toward risk are found to be positively but insignificantly related to investment awareness. These results ratify the need to formulate and implement operative actions to decrease the issue of investment awareness. This study adds to the body of knowledge on the determinants of investment awareness, specifically among the young generation (university students). Furthermore, examining the level of investment awareness could offer vital implications to policymakers, educational institutions, and families on how to enhance the awareness of young investors and support them in making good investment decisions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper is not an indictment of Black banks and financial institutions, but it pre-sents the difficulties and failures of such minority businesses. Unfortunately, some African Americans are naïve when it comes to banking, primarily because of a lack of financial literacy; and such education is not taught in our schools. Of course, financial education is the key for Black patrons who have never had a bank account. Whether this means that African Americans should only bank with Black financial institutions is important to understand, because of the racial disparities and flat-out discrimination when it comes to banking credit and providing business, home, and personal loans to Black banking clientele. In this regard, traditional white banks in the United States simply upset the financial apple-cart, to use the metaphor, when it comes to fairly deal-ing with Black people—that is, lending to Black entrepreneurs and legitimate borrow-ers. With the failure of Black banks, because of a lack of capital and high net-worth individuals and white investors, it has been extremely hard for many of these venerable institutions to hang-on when providing maximum loan possibilities needed over the years (sometimes more than necessary). © 2022, Polish Academy of Sciences - Institute of Philosophy and Sociology.

AB  - In this research, we analyzed green finance, small and medium-sized businesses, and financial literacy in China to boost the green economy. Green finance and financial literacy were examined holistically using a rigorous empirical approach and data envelopment analysis to provide the way to advance green economic recovery in this research. According to empirical evidence, green financing impacts SMEs at 0.31, 0.41, and 2.02 on green economic recovery. China’s green finance and small businesses contribute significantly to the country’s overall green economic revival. A more accurate forecast of green economic recovery was made possible by including other variables such as population expansion, development, and small business development. The analysis used the data envelopment analysis, and the results were solid. Additional hypothetical time-dependent instances demonstrated China’s predicted green financing and small business’s nexus for 2000 to 2020. The proportion of SMEs is decreasing, and as a result, green financing and financial literacy have increased by an average of 12.5% during this time. China’s green financing would fall dramatically if the country’s industrial structure is reduced. According to our findings, financial literacy is positively correlated with green economic recovery, while illiteracy is negatively correlated with growth. Finally, the report provides some ideas for China’s future green economic recovery. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Financial literacy is one of the key abilities and skills MSME business actors require to manage their finances and achieve successful business performance. This study's purpose was to analyze the impact of financial and technological literacy on improving MSME performance in Medan City and the mediation of this relationship by financial inclusion. The research had a quantitative descriptive methodology with an explanatory research approach. Data were collected from a sample of 100 business actors in Medan City. The data analysis technique used was Structural Equation Modelling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS). The results showed that financial literacy, financial technology, and financial inclusion affected the performance of MSMEs in Medan City, and financial inclusion did not mediate the effects of financial literacy and financial technology on the performance of MSMEs in Medan City. The novelty of this research is its capacity to inform stakeholders of the importance of the financial literacy of MSME business actors; therefore, stakeholders must strive to educate MSME business actors on the importance of financial literacy. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Online Academic Press, USA.

AB  - Shadow banking is usually considered as offering financial and financial-related support outside of the mainstream conventional financial system. The biggest issue facing micro-, small, and medium-sized businesses (MSMEs) in Nigeria is the inconveniences and challenges associated with obtaining funds or credit from conventional banks, which encourages remote business operations and small-scale expansion. Thus, shadow banking activity is still widespread among MSMEs in Nigeria. This study used MSMEs operating in the Marian and Watt markets to analyze the impact of shadow bank interest income, savings products, and loans on the performance of MSMEs. A systematic Likert scale questionnaire was given to a group of 160 people, with 157 questionnaires duly returned. The survey research design was adopted, while the SPSS software was used to analyze the data acquired. As such, shadow banking interest income has a non-significant positive impact (0.022%) on the performance of MSMEs in Calabar metropolis; shadow banking savings products have a negative but significant impact (–0.160%) on MSME performance in Calabar metropolis, while shadow banking loans have a positive and significant effect (0.194%) on micro-, small, and medium-scale firm performance in Calabar metropolis. The study concluded that shadow bank operators should ensure that their service costs are standardized and supplied at affordable rates to attract MSMEs to patronize them for more successful business operations. © Anthony Ogar, Joseph Anyadighibe, Jeremiah Abanbeshie, Aniebiet Etuk, Basil Eja, 2023.

AB  - This study examines the effect of fintech and financial inclusion moderated by financial literacy in improving the financial performance and business growth of SMEs in Indonesia. The purposive sampling technique was used to obtain data from 202 SMEs in Indonesia, statistically analysed using descriptive and multiple regression analyses. The results showed that financial literacy could moderate the effect of fintech on financial inclusion. Furthermore, fintech cannot improve financial performance, despite being moderated by financial literacy. Meanwhile, financial inclusion can improve financial performance, and subsequently, financial performance increases the business growth of SMEs. Implications of this study are that SMEs must improve financial literacy, and the government needs to improve regulations on financial literacy, fintech, and financial inclusion, especially for SMEs.

AB  - The last few years have witnessed a rapid development in digital finance that may threaten the manner in which traditional financial services are being used. It opens up new opportunities for low-income groups and small businesses that have limited or no access to formal financial services. Thus, digital financial inclusion plays a vital role in boosting a country’s financial inclusion, fulfilling some sustainable development goals and achieving higher economic growth. This study builds on a new measure of digital financial inclusion to examine the impact of digital financial inclusion and bank competition on bank stability in Sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2014 to 2020 using the two-step System Generalised Method of Moments. An index of digital financial inclusion, z-score, Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI), and non-performing loans were used as data variables. The study findings reveal that digital financial inclusion has a significant positive relationship with bank stability (z-score) and a negative relationship with non-performing loans. The study also found a significant negative effect of bank competition (HHI) on bank stability in line with the competition-fragility view. Policymakers should ensure digital financial literacy for all since it feeds into bank stability and also reduces bank insolvency. They should also find ways of enhancing bank competition which reduces non-performing loans and bank insolvency. On practical implications, the study calls for strategic measures to preserve bank stability, such as complementing digital financial inclusion with financial literacy and enhancing bank competition. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Digitalization in financing industries, has brought us into Financial Technology (Fintech). Fintech proved to be much more accessible to people with low financial literacy. Fintech Lending is one kind of business in fintech. Also known as Pinjol, Fintech Lending become one of the trending topics on Indonesian Twitter, which unfortunately is more about illegal Pinjol, which brings so many insecurities for government, financial regulations, and pinjol company itself. With this research, the sentiment and central character were analyzed. Using several algorithms for data model creation, Naïve Bayes is the most performing one, giving us the fact that negative sentiment still takes the lead on the earlier day of observation, but it decreased over time. We also discovered the most influential character on the issue, to help interested parties to deal with correction, confirmation, and endorsement to support the regulation and survival of the business. Using the pic model, the study concludes that despite its negative sentiment, pinjol still has a good opportunity to grow with the support of government, regulator, and law enforcement team. The policy, regulation, and government resources had to comply with the development speed of pinjol. © Roman Science Publications.

AB  - Orientation: Among the numerous factors affecting small and medium enterprises’ (SMEs) ability to access funding, financial literacy or the lack thereof continues to rank high. The below-average levels of financial literacy among entrepreneurs inevitably restrict their access to finance, thereby adding to the already soaring rate of small business failure. Research purpose: The main research objective of this article is to determine the underlying financial literacy-financial access relationship among SMEs in the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality in South Africa. Motivation of the study: Understanding the relationship between financial literacy and financial access among small businesses is imperative as they are key players in economic development. Empirical literature outlining this relationship is sparse. Therefore, the study made an original empirical contribution to the financial literacy-financial access nexus in the metropolitan. Research design, approach and method: A quantitative descriptive research design was followed. The survey method was used to gather data, where structured questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. The study considered a targeted population of 5609 registered SMEs in Ekurhuleni with a sample size of 384 prospective participants. A total of 310 responses were obtained from the owners and managers of SMEs in the municipality. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to compute all statitical analyses for the study. Descriptive statistics were used to establish the SMEs’ financial literacy and financial access relationship. Data were analysed using factor analysis, regression analysis and correlation analysis. Main findings: Entrepreneurs in Ekurhuleni were found to have a limited understanding of basic financial concepts implying low levels of financial knowledge. Additionally, the study established that financial access was significantly challenging for most SMEs. The findings further revealed a positive relationship between financial literacy and financial access. Practical managerial/ implications: The knowledge from this article may assist entrepreneurs and financial institutions in bridging the financial literacy gap, thereby increasing the likelihood of accessing funding by SMEs. It may also assist in influencing the development and implementation of micro and macroeconomics policies to raise financial literacy levels and leniency from financing sources towards SMEs. © 2023.

AB  - We investigate how introducing a bidding agent impacts the process and outcome of an online reverse auction in the context of a crowdlending platform. We consider this issue in the context of a peer-to-business platform that connects individual lenders to small and medium-sized enterprises. Using a before/after study design, we perform an econometric analysis and find that introducing a bidding agent had a positive and dramatic impact on the number of bids and bidders and reduced the time necessary to collect the funds. For projects with lower ratings, it also positively impacted the number of lenders and indirectly enhanced portfolio diversification. We find that after the bidding agent was introduced, well-rated projects benefited from lower interest rates, the magnitude of the change depending positively on their rating. These results provide evidence that the bidding agent generates savings in the screening and bidding costs incurred by lenders and benefits both sides of the platform. Our contribution documents the role of bidding agent as a strategic tool to enhance financial intermediation. It also sheds light on how two types of decision support systems (rating-based and bidding agent) interact and shows that this interaction is of crucial importance with respect to the financial regulation of platforms if the crowd has low financial literacy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Previous studies on new venture digitalization have claimed that digitalization is becoming more important for new ventures’ survival. However, it is unclear how factors such as digital strategy, organization’s bricolage behaviour, financial literacy and organization’s IT capabilities can influence the adoption of new venture digitalization and affect small and medium enterprises’ (SMEs) specific business activities. This study is aimed at filling the gap in the literature by creating an understanding of how businesses can utilize their IT capabilities to combine resources towards achieving optimal new venture digitalization. Using gender and educational level as moderators, we examine the effect of organization’s IT capabilities, digital strategy, financial literacy and organization’s bricolage behaviour on new venture digitalization. We find that digital strategy, organizational bricolage behaviour and organization’s IT capabilities have a significant effect on new venture digitalization. Furthermore, digital transformation strengthens SMEs’ ability and flexibility to address main business issues. However, financial literacy has no significant effect on SME digitalization. Also, the gender and educational level of SME entrepreneurs seemed not to be influenced by financial literacy and the adoption of digitalization. These findings increase our understanding of how digital strategy, organization’s bricolage behaviour, financial literacy and organization’s IT capabilities can influence the adoption of new venture digitalization. © 2023 MDI.

AB  - Adequate financial management is of great importance to the health care system. In the contemporary state of affairs, health care is facing numerous limitations due to drastic costs and growing pressures to provide quality health care. In such appalling conditions, the managers of health organizations must build skills and knowledge that go beyond the comfort zone of their clinical competencies. It is necessary to develop their leadership skills. Bearing in mind the importance of financial competencies, the general aim of this paper is to determine the competencies of the managers of Serbian health institutions (private and public sector) in this area. Insufficient attention has been given to how health care organizations’ financial literacy affects their sustainability. For the purpose of this prospective research, a questionnaire was created that surveyed the managers of various health care institutions. The results of this study indicated that managers of health organizations have a relatively modest level of financial knowledge. However, they participate in financial activities to a large extent. This gap between the function they perform and the knowledge they have can potentially harm the well-being of the health care organizations they lead. Managers of organizations in the public sector showed a more active role in the development of business plans and more frequent independent decision making, while managers of organizations in the private sector gave more importance to financial control, negotiation, and internal financial reporting, for the improvement of the management process. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The study aims to address two objectives. First, to examine the socioeconomic and demographic factors contributing to financial literacy and second, to analyze if financial literacy affects investment choices. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses financial inclusion insights (FII) survey data conducted by Intermedia, comprising 47,132 individuals in India. Further, instrument variable estimation has been used to analyze the relationship between financial literacy and individuals' investment choices. Findings: The study finds that differences in financial literacy level can be attributed to various socioeconomic/demographic factors like age, gender, education levels, income, location of residence, sources of information, etc. Econometric analyses indicate that financial literacy influences investment decisions, mainly in businesses and traditional assets such as gold, property, etc. Originality/value: The study contributes to the growing literature on financial literacy in the context of developing countries like India and highlights the role of financial literacy in how individuals make investment choices. Using a novel instrument, i.e. participation in the stock market by family or peers for advanced financial literacy, the results provide evidence that advanced financial literacy among individuals increases the probability of their stock market participation.

AB  - Cryptocurrency could redefine the interplay of Internet-connected world markets by eliminating constraints set by traditional local currencies and exchange rates. It has the potential to revolutionise digital markets through the use of duty-free trading. This study investigates the factors which influence the behavioural intention to use cryptocurrency based on the Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM 3) during the COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) pandemic. Data were collected through a cross-sectional questionnaire from 357 Pakistani business-educated adults, including investors who had a rudimentary understanding of the technology and financial instruments. Partial least square (PLS)-based structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the developed theoretical framework based on the Technology acceptance model 3. The PLS model has explained 72.1% of what constitutes the behavioural intention to use cryptocurrency. Surprisingly, risk was not a major consideration. This might be due to the fact that the majority of respondents thought working with cryptocurrency was hazardous. Willingness to handle cryptocurrency risk, on the other hand, might be a stumbling block to acceptance. The most essential aspect of a cryptocurrency's success was the perceived usefulness. Moreover, the moderating role of experience was not substantiated in this study. However, perceived usefulness was identified as a partial mediator of subjective norm and the perceived ease to use. This study contributed to the literature through the application of TAM 3 (an extension of the technology acceptance models) to investigate the fundamental qualities a cryptocurrency should have in order to influence investor's behavioural intention to use it. These findings provide revolutionary insights for the present and future market players for investment planning and for improved cryptocurrencies development.

AB  - Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia have a significant impact on the economy, contributing 38.3% of GDP in 2022, and so serve as the backbone of the nation. Entrepreneurs’ intention to success and their demographic attributes play a crucial role in SMEs’ future growth (Delmar and Wiklund, 2008). This paper utilises the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to analyse and propose numerous determinants of attitude (ATT), subjective norms (SN), and perceived behavioural control (PBC) toward success intention among Muslim SMEs. Further, age, education, and gender to model Muslim SMEs’ intention to succeed are also analysed. This study contributes to the understanding of entrepreneurs’ intention to success and their demographic attributes that may lead to successful SMEs, in particular among Muslim SMEs in Malaysia.

AB  - Background: Women have generally lower levels of financial literacy than their male counterparts, regardless of country of origin. This financial literacy gender gap makes women more vulnerable to the effects of pandemics, like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Aim: This study sought to examine financial literacy competencies of women in agribusiness and their financial experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Setting: The study was carried out in five agricultural districts namely, Gweru, Masvingo, Mutoko, Mount Darwin, and Mutare. The districts represented Zimbabwean agricultural regions. Methods: An embedded mixed methods research design was adopted where both qualitative and quantitative data were collected for analysis. Data were successfully collected from 216 women in agribusiness and follow-up interviews were conducted with 15 informants. Results: Women in agribusiness have poor financial literacy competencies. Most women in agribusiness practised only a range of 2–3 good financial behaviours out of the eight examined concepts, with only 10% scoring above the minimum expected score of six. During the pandemic, women in agribusiness lost income and failed to take care of household and business expenses. Conclusion: Women in agribusiness do not practise vital financial literacy competencies required for financial wellbeing and financial resilience. Therefore, the study recommends the implementation of training programmes that capacitate women with basic financial literacy competencies such as budgeting, saving, and retirement planning. Contribution: Financial literacy competencies were conceptualised together with financial experiences during a pandemic for the first time. More so, in the agribusiness sector which is crucial for economic development. © 2023. The Authors.

AB  - Fintech has revolutionized the financial services sector, fundamentally transforming how individuals and businesses manage their finances. However, effective and responsible utilization of these innovative services may require a certain degree of financial competence. To explore this possibility, this study investigates the nexus between financial literacy and fintech usage in the Indian context, considering two distinct measures of financial literacy. Primary data were collected conveniently from 391 respondents through a cross-sectional survey. Probit regression was applied to analyze the relationship between the two dimensions of financial literacy and the adoption of fintech services across three segments: mobile banking, mobile payments, and digital lending. The findings reveal a positive relationship between individuals’ subjectively perceived financial literacy and their propensity to use all three fintech services. Conversely, objectively measured financial literacy demonstrates a positive association only with the likelihood of using mobile banking. The study also identifies demographic characteristics as contributing factors to variations in fintech adoption. The study’s findings hold value for policymakers and fintech service providers, as they underscore the importance of enhancing individuals’ subjective perceptions of their financial abilities to promote wider adoption of fintech services. © Shamli Prabhakaran, Mynavathi L., 2023.

AB  - How financial literacy (FL) can contribute to both digital entrepreneurship (DE) willingness and behavior has become a widely concerned and controversial topic among scholars and practitioners, one that is particularly relevant for bottom of pyramid (BOP) entrepreneurs. However, existing literature has not established a systematic theoretical framework for this issue, and its internal mechanism has not been thoroughly revealed. Hence, based on behavioral finance theory and digital business-related literature, we construct a multi-layer linear and mediated-moderation model that relates latent variables of FL, financial inclusion (FI), digital literacy (DL), and DE. A total of 664 villagers carrying out DE are the sample from China, and the empirical results mainly reveal the following: FL significantly improves the DE willingness and behavior, and the sense of FI plays a partial mediating role between FL and DE willingness and behavior. DL is a crucial influencing factor that moderates a positive effect between FL and DE willingness and behavior. Moreover, DL plays a mediated-moderating role. By contrast, FL in poverty-stricken counties (PSC) has a more substantial influence on DE than that in non-poverty-stricken counties (NPSC). If the family background (social capital) is superior (excellent), and the resources are abundant, then the influence of FL on DE will be stronger. This research contributes to the theories and practices related to FL, DE, FI, and DL. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (East Java, Indonesia) are one of the businesses that drive developing nations' economies with various challenges, particularly in finance and digitalization. The impact of financial literacy and the use of digitalization can affect the recording and reporting of company performance. This is quantitative research, and the population in this research is SMEs in East Java, with 401 SMEs from various businesses for the sample used. This research uses the primary data method of SMEs in East Java with the Structural Equation Model as a data analysis tool. The results showed a significant relationship between financial literacy and financial performance, and digital literacy was based on financial performance. However, digital literacy could not moderate financial literacy with the financial performance of East Java SMEs. Much of the untapped potential in this study was adopted from financial governance and digitalization. It is hoped that the subsequent study will examine other phenomena on the variables used in the post-pandemic. © 2022 World Association for Triple helix and Future strategy studies.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate whether the level of financial literacy differs significantly among entrepreneurs in three European countries: Italy, Spain, and the UK. Moreover, I analyze whether financial literacy fosters or hinders entrepreneurial resilience and success. I find that the level of basic financial literacy is significantly lower among entrepreneurs in the UK. I provide an explanation based on job opportunities arguing that basic financial literacy increases the chances of survival of a business, whereas advanced financial literacy decreases it. I propose a taxonomy linking levels of financial literacy with different approaches to financial management. I conclude that a “conservative” approach to financial management (cash based, debt-averse and diversified) is more likely to guarantee survival even if it is not necessarily the best way to maximize firm value. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - This study investigates the factors that affect farmers’ access to Food Security and Agricultural Credit (FSAC) services for the farmers of Pakistan who have no access to banking but have a feasible farm business. Using multiple regressions and logistic analysis, the authors revealed the determinants of farmers’ financial literacy and analyzed the variables which affected the farmers’ accessibility to FSAC. Results indicated that the average financial literacy of respondents was at a moderate level. It was affected by the age of respondents, length of their education, distance to nearby cities, ownership of bank accounts, annual income, and financial education experience. The FSAC accessibility was also impacted by the area of cultivated land, interest rate, collateral, farms’ income, financial literacy index, credit accessibility experiences, the legal status of farmer groups, and the amount of a loan. Some of the issues that prevent farmers from having widespread access to the FSAC include the lack of loan need, lack of FSAC awareness, lack of collateral, loan usury perspective, loan rejection experience, fear of borrowing from the bank, and inactive farmer groups. The study contributes to the existing literature on the determinants of farmers’ access and choice of credit sources by using a primary data set. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In line with today’s economy, investment and financial awareness are necessary for success and an individual’s well-being, specifically for the younger generations. Therefore, this study aims to examine the relationships between financial literacy, saving behavior, a lack of self-control, family financial socialization, and investment awareness. Further, it investigates the moderating role of both family financial socialization and the lack of self-control in these relationships. Employing a quantitative study technique and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), we analyzed a sample of 409 students representing young adults at King Faisal University, specifically in the School of Business. Our results indicate that financial literacy, saving behavior, and family financial socialization are significantly and positively related to investment awareness. Interestingly and as expected, a lack of self-control negatively and significantly affects investment awareness. For the moderating impact, it was found that the connection between financial literacy, saving behavior, and investment awareness is positively and strongly moderated by family financial socialization. Likewise, a lack of self-control significantly and negatively moderated the association between financial literacy, saving behavior, and investment awareness. The results of this study provide substantial implications for regulators, educational organizations, individuals, and their families. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The technological revolution we have been witnessing over the last 30 years is bringing about important changes in business management, specifically in the conception, development, and management of its financial aspects. How to face these challenges is a particularly critical question for individual entrepreneurs who have to assume a much greater responsibility for decisions than in other corporate environments. In this sense, it is very important to understand the financial capabilities and skills and their limitations of this type of entrepreneurship, which is so important for the renewal and extension of the business community in any developed economy. Based on an extensive official survey of this type of entrepreneurship, this research proposes a logistic regression modeling, in order to find out the level of financial knowledge of this business group. One of the findings of this research is that individual entrepreneurs have a higher level of financial knowledge than salaried workers, with a higher qualification in this respect in the case of individual entrepreneurs with employees. This study analyses the link between individual entrepreneurs or self-employed workers – with or without employees – and financial literacy. In addition, we investigated the relationship between this group with their socio-demographic characteristics, financial product holdings, financial planning, and financial fragility. Different binary logistic regression models with maximum likelihood were estimated using a sample of individual entrepreneurs and self-employed workers from the Survey of Financial Competences database conducted in Spain to achieve this. The results of the study show that individuals who choose to be individual entrepreneurs or self-employed, and in particular those with hired workers, had a higher level of financial literacy than salaried workers. Moreover, it was confirmed that financial literacy complements the explanatory power of the other variables analyzed with respect to sole proprietors without employees, although not to a significant degree. The limitations of this work are due to the use of data from the Financial Skills Survey, so some dichotomous variables offer very generic information. In addition, the database is cross-sectional and we cannot analyze variations between different periods. No research before had applied the relationships between the behavior of individual entrepreneurs, with and without employees, and financial competencies using logistic functions and on the basis of a rigorous and comprehensive formal questionnaire. The conclusions provide a valuable perspective for developing training programs for this type of human capital aimed at raising the financial skills of individual entrepreneurs to improve personal and business management. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: This study explored the nature of business practices of small- and micro-enterprises within the South African context to propose recommendations for financial literacy education strategies. Design/methodology/approach: The data collection technique used for this qualitative study included semi-structured in-depth interviews with a case study of 10 small- and micro-enterprise owners who collectively trade within five of the nine South African provinces. Findings/results: Small- and micro-enterprises do not need to differ significantly because the respective business practice themes identified are relevant within both contexts. Both category enterprises make use of a cash basis system, generally have inventory management systems in place and do not have sophisticated financial planning practices. The micro-enterprises studied do not have business plans or accurate pricing strategies and cash management is a concern. The small-enterprise participants generally did not show interest in competitors and their enterprises had more sophisticated bookkeeping practices in place than micro-enterprises. Practical implications: Financial literacy education strategies for the owners should focus on providing guidance on tax matters, significance of business plans and how to prepare them, debtors management strategies, inventory management strategies, and a basic bookkeeping system that evolves from the cash basis of accounting to the accrual basis of accounting. It should also aim to educate owners on the importance of financial planning and risk management. Originality/value: This research provides an evidence-based description of the characteristics of South African small- and micro-enterprises, which could prove valuable in developing future owner financial literacy education programmes as well as other support strategies targeted at this audience. © 2023.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to adopt the mutuality perspective from the field of human resource management (HRM) to examine family firms, specifically human resource (HR) practices that are likely to be found in Thai family firms. Design/methodology/approach: The cross-case analysis of three successful unreformed or authoritarian family firms in Thailand draws on semistructured interviews with top managers and/or HR managers as well as the employees of each family firm, field visits to each firm and a review of archival documents and Web-based resources. Findings: This paper proposes that the recruitment of employees via alternative or substream recruitment channels (especially the recruitment of current employees’ relatives or family members), paternalistic employee relations practices and the management of aging employees, specifically with regard to the absence of retirement age, the facilitation of financial planning, reduced workload, the appointment of mentors/advisors and the encouragement of aging employees to transfer knowledge to younger generations tend to be found across Thai family firms, especially the unreformed or authoritarian type. These HR practices are implemented across family firms because they help to manage high levels of debt that have accumulated over many years so that employees attain financial literacy before retirement and to foster and maintain positive relationships between managers and employees across firms. These positive relationships thus foster the retention of capable and loyal, aging employees who have been developed within the firm and who have worked with the firm for a long time (so-called Look-Mor), leading to the maintenance of tacit knowledge and experience within firms and the alleviation of the problem of labor shortage. Theoretically, this paper proposes that a family-like corporate culture typically found in family firms serves as the antecedent to the adoption and implementation of those HR practices (so-called culture determinism). In particular, the fit between corporate culture and HR practices is likely to foster the strong commitment among employees to firms and the feelings of job security among these employees (so-called commitment match in the mutuality of the employment relationship). Research limitations/implications: An important limitation of this study concerns its methodology. Because this study is based on the case studies of only three unreformed or authoritarian family firms located in Thailand, the findings in this paper only propose substream or alternative HR practices that are likely to be found across Thai family firms; therefore, generalization to all other types of family firms and all other family firms across countries is not possible. Examining whether the HR practices proposed in this paper are uniquely found across family firms should be the subject of future research. Another limitation of this study is that it does not include firms located in other industries, such as the health-care industry and the hotel and restaurant industry. Future research could explore the HR practices implemented by family firms in these industries. Moreover, quantitative studies using large samples of family firms across industries might be useful in deepening the understanding of the HR practices implemented in family firms from the mutuality perspective on HRM. Practical implications: This paper has practical implications for top managers and/or HR managers across firms not only in Thailand but also in other countries. First, top managers and/or HR managers across family firms, especially those of the unreformed or authoritarian type, should implement the HR practices proposed in this paper that are aligned well with a family-like corporate culture found in family firms to foster the strong commitment among employees to firms and the feeling of job security among these employees. Second, other types of firms (e.g. publicly owned corporations and multinational corporations) that do not have a family-like corporate culture may have to adapt some of these HR practices to their corporate culture and workplace atmosphere within their firms. Third, to manage and retain high-quality aging employees within firms, top managers and HR managers across various types of firms should implement some of the HR practices for managing aging employees proposed in this paper so that the firms can retain invaluable aging employees over time. Social implications: This paper provides social/policy implications for the government and/or relevant public agencies of Thailand and of several other emerging market economies. These governments should encourage the firms located in their countries to implement some of the HR practices proposed in this paper to maintain and support knowledgeable and skillful aging employees in their firms. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the two main bodies of literature on HRM and family business in the following ways. First, most previous studies on HRM have focused on the mainstream HR practices used in large firms while neglecting the alternative or substream HR practices used in family firms. Additionally, relatively little research has specifically examined the mutuality perspective with regard to HRM. Thus, this paper extends the literature on HRM and family business settings regarding HR practices that are likely to be found across Thai family firms, corporate culture as an antecedent of the adoption and implementation of those HR practices, and the fit between corporate culture and HR practices with respect to mutuality in the employment relationship. Moreover, the literature on HRM has typically overlooked the underresearched country of Thailand; most studies in this area have primarily focused on developed countries or other emerging market economies, including China and India. The findings of this paper provide an in-depth analysis of HR practices that are likely to be found in family firms located in the emerging market economy of Thailand according to the mutuality perspective with regard to HRM. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Financial planning for retirement is essential to ensure that people have enough money to live the lifestyle they desire when they retire. Self-employed business owners in developed countries widely do financial retirement planning. However, in Malaysia, the percentage of self-employed individuals concerned about financial retirement planning is lower than in other countries. This study aims to identify the relationship between the financial attitude, financial literacy and health literacy of self-employed individuals toward sustainable financial retirement planning in Malaysia and find out the moderating effect of the role of financial advisors. The study utilized structural equation modelling. Data were collected through a survey questionnaire and analyzed using SMART PLS 3.3. The total sample size was 416 self-employed individuals from the northern Malaysian region. The findings revealed that financial attitude and financial literacy significantly impact retirement planning. Moreover, the role of financial advisors moderates the relationship between financial attitude–financial retirement planning and financial literacy–financial retirement planning. The result of the study will fulfil the needs of self-employed individuals to plan their retirement by including the financial planning determinants needed for a well-planned retirement. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - PURPOSE: The first objective of this study is to identify the factors that contribute to the success of equity crowdfunding (ECF) campaigns in Japan. We examined what makes a campaign successful using data from 217 campaigns conducted on FUNDINNO, Japan’s largest ECF platform, between February 2017 and May 2021. The second objective is to assess individual investors’ financial literacy based on the ECF campaign’s success or failure. This study is unique in that it focuses on funding method differences as well as the contents of the business plans disclosed in the ECF campaigns. In Japan, a common equity campaign and stock acquisition rights campaign are run on the same ECF platform, as if they were the same type of funding. Common stock and stock acquisition rights are treated differently by venture capitalists and other professional investors. By comparing the success or failure of the two Japanese projects, we can assess individual investors’ financial literacy after taking into account the project signals. METHODOLOGY: The “Signaling Hypothesis” and the “Lack of Financial Literacy Hypothesis” were tested. Nine and four variables were set as proxy variables for the Signaling Hypothesis and the Lack of Financial Literacy Hypothesis, respectively. This study first divides the qualitative data into success/failure dichotomies for the proxy variables that comprise the hypotheses and then uses a chi-square test to examine the composition ratio of each. The quantitative data among the hypotheses’ proxy variables are then tested for differences in means (t-test) and medians (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Subsequently, we perform a probit analysis with the explained variable being “success (1)/failure (0)” and the explanatory variable being a proxy variable for the hypothesis. We begin with a probit analysis, and the Logit model is then introduced. Finally, a multiple regression analysis is run with the explained variables “fundraising rate” and “number of investors” and the hypothesized proxy variables as explanatory variables. FINDINGS: We found that the “number of directors” is an effective management ability indicator of ECF success. In terms of start-up fundamentals, investors appear to accept the signals “intellectual property”, “product releases” and “tax incentives.” Awards affected the size of the final funding round. In contrast, B2C companies negatively signaled to private investors. The proxy variable “in final year sales” was supported concerning the lack of a financial literacy hypothesis. Individual investors can be assumed to be financially literate if they perform due diligence. However, since “expected rate of return (Internal Rate of Return, hereafter abbreviated as IRR)” and “common stock dummy” are uncorrelated, we can conclude that they do not demonstrate financial literacy in “valuation,” nor whether or not the investment is profitable. Thus, individual investors’ financial literacy in the Japanese ECF can be considered to be limited. IMPLICATIONS: We have demonstrated which signals investors in Japan’s ECF campaigns respond to. These guidelines will be useful for future start-ups planning ECF campaigns. We were able to identify the lack of financial literacy among ECF individual investors. Therefore, for Japan’s equity capital market to grow in the future, individual investors’ financial literacy must be improved. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: With very limited analysis in Asia, home to the world’s second-and third-largest stock markets, we have identified the factors behind the success of Japan’s ECF. Identifying success factors in a country like Japan, where many individual investors are extremely risk averse, will provide new insights. By comparing the success or failure of the two types of Japanese ECF projects (common equity projects and stock acquisition rights), we could test the financial literacy of individual investors, taking into account the project signals. © 2023, Cognitione Foundation for the Dissemination of Knowledge and Science.

AB  - This study empirically examined the relationship between entrepreneurial financial literacy, access to credit, and the sustainability of small businesses in Ethiopia. The study used cross-sectional data collected from 293 owner-managers of small businesses through a survey questionnaire in 2022. It used structural equation modelling to analyze the results. Therefore, the paper’s empirical evidence revealed that entrepreneurial financial literacy contributes to small business sustainability. The findings also show that access to formal credit financing mediates entrepreneurial financial literacy- small business sustainability nexus. In this regard, the paper contributes to the literature on small businesses by demonstrating the importance of entrepreneurial financial literacy and access to formal credit financing for the sustainability of small businesses in Ethiopia, considering the knowledge-resource-based view. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper examines whether the increase in financial literacy of audit committee (AC) members induced by business trainings leads to the decrease in firms’ earnings management, the act of misrepresenting the firms’ financial performance. Using a novel hand-collected dataset of Korean listed companies for the period of 2018–2020, we find that business trainings increase the effectiveness of ACs by enhancing the ability to detect earnings management. Also, our results reveal that the positive effect of business trainings is more pronounced for AC members who lack financial literacy, which suggests that training programs are effective for less financially sophisticated members. © 2022

AB  - Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are business sectors known to play an essential role in the economic growth of a country, especially in Indonesia. In this context, the creative industry is one of the fastest-growing business sectors and the promotion of sustainable economic development is evident in the government's active support for improving the growth of MSMEs. Therefore, this study analyzes the impact of financial literacy and market orientation on the MSMEs performance and sustainability. The sample includes 95 respondents occupying the roles of owners or managers in the creative industry of Yogyakarta Province. The results show that financial literacy and market orientation positively impact performance and sustainability. The performance of MSMEs influences business sustainability but financial literacy has no significant impact. Therefore, the implications show the indispensable need for governmental assistance in improving the knowledge base of MSMEs owners concerning financial literacy and market orientation. © 2023, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

AB  - Entrepreneurship has been viewed as a catalyst for economic growth because it creates jobs and offers solutions to social issues. The government is trying to make entrepreneurship popularized among the public, especially in students in universities. This analysis aims to ascertain how financial behavior and literacy, particularly among accounting students who are the sample of this study at West Java universities, affect entrepreneurial motivation. In addition, this research also examined the level of financial literacy and the level of financial behavior in accounting students in West Java, Indonesia. This research employs a quantitative approach and the data were collected using a survey questionnaire. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) method were used to analyze data of 252 respondents of accounting students from universities in West Java, Indonesia. The study discovered a significant positive association between financial literacy and accounting students’ financial behavior and their willingness to start their own business. The research also assessed the degree of financial literacy and financial behavior among participants who achieved a relatively strong overall outcome, along with the level of drive for entrepreneurship among respondents with a similarly elevated average performance. This research contributes to educators and educational institutions that it is very important to design an integrated educational curriculum to strengthen the entrepreneurial motivation of accounting students who are the sample of this study at West Java universities in Indonesia. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - We examine the impact of providing access to mobile savings accounts and improving financial management skills on the performance of microenterprises in Mozambique. The effects are highly heterogeneous: Combining both types of support is associated with a large increase in both short- and long-term firm profits and in financial security for female microentrepreneurs. This allowed female-headed microenterprises, particularly those with a higher level of profits at baseline, to close the gender profit gap in performance and skills relative to their male counterparts. The main drivers of improved business performance are improved financial management practices (bookkeeping), an increase in accessible savings, and reduced transfers to friends and relatives. Providing access to mobile money as a tool to save and manage finances also increases long-term profits of female microentrepreneurs, particularly for those with higher profits at baseline. However, neither treatment has any impact on male-led enterprises. Uncovering this heterogeneity in impact across different types of microenterprises can help improve the targeting of these interventions in the future. © 2022 INFORMS.

AB  - Financial management behavior is an implementation action of planning and managing a person's financial resources, both in consumption and investment activities, which can show a person's characteristics in financial management based on the risks that arise so that each needs good control. This study aims to determine the impact of financial literacy and financial attitude on financial management behavior, mediated by the behavioral intentions of university students. The participants in this study are undergraduate students currently enrolled at prestigious private universities in Medan (North Sumatra, Indonesia). This study's population and sample consisted of students from the Faculty of Economics and Business at Private Universities in North Sumatra, Indonesia. Purposive and snowball sampling were used with data collection techniques, namely online questionnaires. The Likert scale measures indicators in responses to statements and questions. There were 150 respondents for this study's data collection. The findings of the study indicate that financial literacy influences financial management behavior and behavioral intentions (p < 0.05). Financial attitude affects financial management behavior (p < 0.05), financial attitude does not affect behavioral intentions (p > 0.05), and behavioral intention affects Financial Management Behavior (p < 0.05). Behavioral intentions do not mediate the effect of financial literacy on Financial Management Behavior (p > 0.05), and the effect of financial attitudes on Financial Management Behavior is not mediated by behavioral intentions (p > 0.05).  © Sri Fitri Wahyuni, Radiman, Muhammad Shareza Hafiz, Jufrizen, 2023.

AB  - Background: The belief of individuals and access to useful, affordable financial resources by small and medium businesses, especially to manage their finances to improve their financial condition, is limited. Objectives: This study investigates the impact of financial inclusion on the financial condition of small and medium enterprises in south-west Nigeria through financial self-efficacy and financial literacy. Methods/Approach: This study employs the purposive sampling technique to employ a quantitative method on the active population of registered small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs). Two statistical software were used; statistical package for social sciences and structural equation modelling to test the mediating effect of financial self-efficacy and financial literacy on relationship between financial inclusion and financial capability of SMEs. Results: The component effectively measures all its constructs with the confirmatory factor analysis measure. Based on the structural model, financial inclusion directly and indirectly through financial self-efficacy and financial literacy positively influences financial capability. Conclusion: This shows that financial inclusion amplifies the financial condition of SMEs in south-west part of Nigeria. It was recommended that managers of the firms should encourage and implement suitable and appropriate financial inclusion strategies to enhance financial conditions. Likewise, management of the SMEs when making decision on the product and service offered should strategically create thoughtful ideals that will increase their ability to manage their financial condition through financial self-efficacy and literacy. However, it was suggested that similar studies be conducted in other sectors of the economy. © 2023 MDI.

AB  - The value of MSMEs can be seen from their contribution to the national economy. More than 99% of Indonesia’s current business units are MSMEs, contributing about 61% of GDP and providing all 97% of all jobs (Damuri, 2020). The research is conducted using the OECD framework (2018) to determine the financial literacy rate implications on MSMEs’ company profitability. As many as 205 MSMEs owners in Bandung were asked through questionnaires during March 2020 to April 2020. The findings subsequently indicated that the financial literacy rate of MSMEs in Bandung is moderate, with the total cumulative score of 67.9%. Copyright © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: This paper examines students' decisions when playing an in-class version of the TV game, Deal or No Deal (DOND), to study the relation between personal characteristics and individual decision-making under risk. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes DOND game play data collected from 374 students in 13 university finance classes, and their personal characteristics collected in a post-game survey. It uses ordered probit, OLS and probit regression analysis to examine the impact of personal characteristics on an individual's risk tolerance. Findings: The key finding is that international students are significantly more risk averse than US domestic students. Additionally, given the natural control for age and education, the study finds that gender, race and religion have a limited impact on an individual's risk tolerance. Finally, the study provides evidence that the structure of the DOND game, in general, rewards risk-taking as long as it is not excessive. Once participant behavior becomes risk-seeking, the correlation between risk-taking and game payoff becomes negative. Research limitations/implications: The homogeneous set of contestants (business students) analyzed in this study presents some limitations yet provides opportunities to examine risk tolerance differences between the US and international students, and whether gender, race or religious affiliation has an impact on the level of risk tolerance given a natural control for age and education level. Practical implications: The evidence suggests that culture and environmental unfamiliarity may impact an individual's risk tolerance. This finding is useful when providing financial advice to diverse clients or when conducting international business. Additionally, understanding that education and financial literacy reduces differences in risk tolerance across gender, race and religion can impact the way we interact with others. A broader practical implication for all investors is that, while under normal circumstances, risk-taking is rewarded with a higher expected return, excessive risk-taking may harm their investment performance. Originality/value: This paper utilizes a unique data set, collected through a class activity and post-class survey. While there have been empirical studies using DOND data, this is the first study that examines the impact of personal characteristics on game participants' behavior, thereby generating unique findings not reported in previous studies employing DOND data. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Financial literacy (FL) is an important ability needed by any individual to understand, evaluate, and communicate business and financial information. Having accurate financial information increases one’s competency to be financial literate. It is regarded as a common and basic life skill that libraries can develop for their users. Using purposive sampling, this study ponders into the status and challenges of eight public city libraries in the Philippines in terms of providing FL education and how they can potentially share a role in developing the economy of a country. Public libraries’ readiness to serve their users can be observed in terms of their collection, web presence, services, and programs. The level of financial knowledge and competencies of city librarians were also assessed. A look into the available professional development programs for public librarians in business and finance librarianship was reviewed. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The study of financial literacy and locus of control in the creative economy is a relatively new area of research. However, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that these factors can have a significant impact on the performance of businesses in this sector. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine if training, locus of control, and financial literacy have a direct influence on the performance of creative MSMEs; and to determine whether training has an indirect effect on the performance of creative MSMEs through financial literacy. A convenience sample of 115 respondents served as the study's main source of data in the municipality (Yogyakarta) and four regencies (Sleman, Bantul, Kulonprogo, Gunung Kidul). The data were analyzed using SPSS 22, path analysis and Sobel's test. The results revealed that training, the internal position of control, and financial literacy positively affected performance. However, the position of the external control did not affect the performance. In addition, the training had a positive effect on financial literacy and affected performance through financial literacy. These results indicate that financial understanding, training and individual self-perception have become critical elements to enhance company performance because they enable actors to manage their businesses according to objectives. © 2023

AB  - Loan defaulting is a prominent challenge to financial institutions' outreach and sustainability. As it has been increasing and become a critical problem in the study area, this study aimed to analyze the loan repayment performance of Micro and Small-scale Enterprise (MSEs) in North Wollo Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. The study used a multi-stage sampling technique to select 336 sample enterprises (181 non-defaulter and 155 defaulters). Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from primary and secondary data sources. The descriptive statistics result showed that non-defaulting was higher in trade (29.28%) and manufacturing (21.55%) MSEs, while high defaulting pertains to MSEs engaged in agriculture (24.52%) and construction (21.93%) sectors, respectively. The findings of financial ratios revealed that the average current ratio, debt ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio were 0.65, 0.72 and 7.95, respectively. The logit regression result showed that enterprise manager education level, collateral security, and financial literacy positively and significantly affected loan repayment performance while distance to lending institutions, repayment period, and loan diversion negatively affected it. Therefore, this study recommends that lending institutions and other concerned organizations organize warranties for the loan, align repayment schedules with the production period of enterprises, inclusive monitoring and supervision, and provide financial and basic business training to enterprises. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the association between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success among young entrepreneurs within an economically disadvantaged community in Cape Town, South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The mixed-method approach was adopted for the study. In-depth interviews were used in collecting the qualitative data while structured interviews using questionnaires were administered in collecting the quantitative data. The participants for the study were strictly young entrepreneurs. Findings: The study found that entrepreneurs understood the concept of financial literacy and this was corroborated by their financial literacy average score of 59.03, which is above the national financial literacy average score of 54.00. The study further revealed that a positive association exists between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success. Hence, high levels of financial literacy result in increased business success. Research limitations/implications: The sample size of the study was relatively small, for which reason, a mixed-method approach was adopted to strengthen the research findings. The research also considered only one disadvantaged community in South Africa (Khayelitsha). Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, the influences of financial literacy on the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) among young entrepreneurs have not been well-explored in economically disadvantaged areas within the South African context. As a result, this study sheds light by assessing the level of financial literacy among young entrepreneurs in economically disadvantaged communities and by determining the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success. The study further provides recommendations on policy-making to ensure that through successful entrepreneurship, developmental challenges such as unemployment can be reduced. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The paper examines the mediating effect of financial literacy on fintech and SMEs’ performance during COVID-19 recovery in Cameroon. The study collects 381 survey data from SMEs in Yaoundé and Douala, the country’s business hub, to determine how these financial technology innovations affect SMEs’ business performance. Similarly, the PLS-SEM model was used to test the proposed hypotheses. The study results show that the relationship between fintech and financial literacy was positive and significant. The findings also reveal that fintech has a positive and significant effect on SMEs performance. In addition, the results further indicate that financial literacy positively and significantly mediates the relationship between fintech services and the performance of SMEs. Therefore, the study concludes that financial literacy is an essential mechanism through which fintech services influence SMEs’ operational and financial performance in Cameroon. The study has provided a better understanding of how SMEs can improve their performance by leveraging fintech solutions through financial literacy. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - We analyze the risk attitude of women and men entrepreneurs in the micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and investigate the factors that influence the risk attitude of MSE owners. The empirical analysis of the study consists of two parts. First, we use a moment-based approach to estimate the risk preferences of male and female entrepreneurs. Second, we estimate a regression model to understand the correlates of risk attitude and decompose the gender difference in risk aversion using the Oaxaca-Blinder technique. The results indicate that MSE entrepreneurs are risk-averse, with a relative risk premium of 1.5%. We also find that females are slightly more risk-averse than male entrepreneurs. Our regression estimates show that entrepreneurs’ risk attitude is significantly correlated with the age and experience of the entrepreneur, marital status, education level and financial literacy, wealth, sector, and business form. Furthermore, the predictor variables significantly explain the gender difference in risk aversion, while the unexplained component is insignificant. This suggests that the gender difference in risk aversion is due to disparities in socioeconomic factors than a biological difference in risk preference. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study is to analyse the role of internal social capital and external social capital in determining the financial and non-financial performance of the firm and the effect of manager’s intangible capabilities on internal social capital and external social capital of firm in the context of the manufacturing sector of India. Design/methodology/approach: The data for this study is collected from 417 managers of manufacturing firms through a structured questionnaire and is analysed through SPSS and AMOS by performing confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: Findings reveal that a manager’s business experience, financial literacy and intellectual capital significantly enhance the firm’s internal and external social capital. Furthermore, it has been found that the internal social capital of the firm has the potential to enhance the performance of the firm in financial and non-financial terms. The external social capital also significantly derives from the firm’s financial performance; however, it has not significantly impacted its non-financial performance in the current study. Research limitations/implications: These findings provide many implications in theoretical and practical terms because the literature regarding social capital and the linkage among social capital, intangible capabilities and firm performance will be enhanced. The strategymakers and policymakers can also benefit from this study’s implications for making better strategies and policies regarding social capital and the firm’s performance. Originality/value: Past studies, though, examined the influence of social capital on business performance. However, no prior research addresses the phenomenon through which social capital can determine business performance while undertaking the role of a manager’s intangible capabilities in such a model. Therefore, the current study is the first to study the interrelationship among the manager’s intangible capabilities, social capital, and firm performance. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Numerous nations are worried about adolescent gambling addiction and challenges associated with gambling. Therefore, they have developed strategies to address these concerns (Dixon et al., 2016). This study aims to evaluate gambling management structures in Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau, and Thailand, and to compare educational-based gambling prevention strategies established in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Macau to find the best successful strategy for Thai students. For data collection, qualitative techniques such as document analysis and in-depth interviews were employed. The results indicate that the success of gambling management in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Macau is attributable to the collaboration of many sectors and the allocation of sufficient budgets. Gambling concerns are controlled completely by the government in Thailand, yet there are no government entities specifically responsible for gambling issues, creating management complications. In addition, a lack of finances may lead to poor management planning. The aforementioned three nations have achieved success in preventing gambling by employing strong national programmes and strategies. The objective of these programmes is to assist at-risk students in overcoming or preparing for addiction issues. Thailand must prioritise education on gambling, financial literacy, and collaboration of all relevant agencies to achieve success in gambling management and prevention. © 2022 The Author.

AB  - The overall degree of financial development of the State depends on innovative development of the financial sector. In this regard, it is important to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the characteristics, scopes and limits of the application of digital financial innovations both at the State level and at the global level, which determines the relevance of the research topic. The aim of the research is to develop an approach to assessment of the characteristics, scopes and limits of digital innovations in the financial sector and its approbation of the approach by the example of Russia. At the theoretical level, the method of literature analysis, abstraction and aggregation are used in the research. At the empirical level, methods of statistical, structural and coefficient analysis are applied. The results of the research in terms of the development of the theory of innovation in the financial sector are development of an approach to assessment of the characteristics and scope of digital innovation in the financial sector, to allow a comprehensive assessment of the development of financial innovation at the State level and comparison of the assessment results by country or with the world average values of the indicators proposed for assessment. The paper also proposes classifications of scopes and limits for the use of digital financial technologies, which allow for a qualitative analysis of the integrated development of financial innovations. Empirical research has allowed us to make conclusions about the accelerated development of the Russian financial technology market compared to the world average values based on the developed theoretical approach. At the same time, the problems of further development of financial innovations have been identified, namely, the low level of trust of the Russian population in small businesses in the field of financial technologies, limiting the inflow of foreign investment and narrowing the external market for the dissemination of Russian financial innovations in conditions of political instability. The following measures are proposed to solve these problems: improving the quality of education and improving the working conditions of specialists in the field of innovations, developing programs for concessional lending to small businesses in the field of financial technologies, and improving the financial literacy of the population as a consumer of innovative financial services.  © Zeleneva E.

AB  - This paper investigated the influence of entrepreneurial competency and financial literacy on sustainable small enterprise performance. We simultaneously investigated the mediating role of entrepreneurial resilience on the association between competence and financial literacy with sustainable business performance. We used a quantitative method for collecting data from 220 small business entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia using an online questionnaire. The collected data were analysed with the help of PLS-SEM. The results reveal that financial literacy significantly positively affects entrepreneurial competency and resilience. Entrepreneurial competency has a significant positive effect on Saudi SMEs’ entrepreneurial resilience and sustainable performance. Finally, entrepreneurial resilience was simultaneously found to have a considerable impact on sustainable performance while mediating the effect of financial literacy and competency on sustainable performance across Saudi SMEs. In line with Saudi Vision 2030, with its profound focus on entrepreneurship and developing a financially independent entrepreneurial community, this research contributes to creating economic opportunities for local entrepreneurs managing small enterprises. Apart from extending the body of knowledge, this research can support policymakers in formulating relevant strategies to encourage SMEs that have been worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic to perform sustainably. Several other implications for financial institutions and entrepreneurs have also been drawn. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Recently, the Government of India has emphasized digital financial inclusion for promoting cashless transactions with a vision to transform India from a traditional cash-based economy into a cashless economy. Technology-driven payment apps are facilitated greater access to cashless financial services and improve the speed, efficiency, accuracy and effectiveness of financial transactions. This study aims to explore the determinants of quick response (QR) code mobile payment (m-payment) adoption intention among marginalized street vendors in India. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed research model was tested using 320 responses from QR code m-payment users. An interview schedule was performed using the structured questionnaire from marginalized street vendors by adopting a purposive sampling technique. The proposed research framework of this study developed on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). In addition to the existing variables proposed in the UTAUT model, three more variables have been added, namely, digital financial literacy (DFL), personal innovativeness (PI) and perceived trust (PT). Besides, the study used confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling techniques to analyze the data. Findings: This study confirms that factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, PT and customers’ DFL are significant determinants of street vendors’ intention to use QR code m-payment services. However, social influence and PI have shown an insignificant relationship with adopting a QR code m-payment system. Research limitations/implications: The results provide insights for policymakers and service providers. Specifically, government and bankers design promotional campaigns emphasizing the ease of use, perceived benefits, security and faster business transactions to accept and use the QR code m-payment system to encourage prospective users to achieve a cashless economy. Originality/value: Many prior studies have widely concentrated on m-payment adoption intention in India. However, only a few studies have attempted to examine the factors influencing the adoption of QR code m-payment services among merchants from emerging economies. There is a dearth of studies on QR code adoption from an unorganized sector perspective, specifically marginalized street vendors. Therefore, this study explicitly examines the extent to which the determinants of adoption intention toward QR code-based m-payment services among marginalized street vendors within the framework of the extended UTAUT model by incorporating DFL, PI and PT. The findings of this study contribute, theoretically and practically, to the existing literature. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article sheds light on the Turkish asset management industry through portfolio managers' perspective. In this empirical research, we surveyed the industry professionals, i.e., the portfolio managers with a comprehensive questionnaire, and aimed to identify the development areas and the recommendation thereof within the market. We reached the following conclusions: The assets under management should be increased especially by introducing new institutional investors into the market. Returns generated by the industry should be enhanced by promoting a competitive environment based on common benchmarks per fund category and introducing new financial instruments. A performance-oriented portfolio management culture whereby portfolio managers are encouraged to seek for alpha should be created, and their individual performance should be transparently and objectively calculated, recorded, and taken into consideration in promotions and career changes. Financial literacy about fund products is very low; enriching TEFAS and creating an independent financial advisory profession licensed by the CMB could help the diffusion of fund products. In Turkey, banking is sixteen times larger than asset management (as of 2019) - a fact hindering the development of the industry - which requires positive discrimination of asset management against banking vis-à-vis the regulations. Reforming the voluntary individual pension system and enforcing a more business-friendly regulation can also help grow the industry. © 2023 Better Advances Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to identify and analyze the internal and external condition that affect tourism development at Payangan beach, Papuma beach, Watu Ulo beach, and Pancer Puger beach as the base for strategy formulation for nautical tourism development model based on coastal community empowerment and financial literacy in Jember regency. The four beaches have internal powers to take advantage of the existing opportunity. The most appropriate strategy to be applied is growth-oriented strategy. Meanwhile, the existing condition appears that institutional and financial literacy become weaknesses on the four beach tourism destinations, therefore defensive strategy is preferable. Both primary data (interview, focus group discussion and questionnaire) and secondary data (study of literature) are employed in this study. By using purposive sampling technique, samples are collected including local coastal community, regional government, tourists, tourism business and related stakeholders. Data analysis is conducted using descriptive statistics analysis, IFAS and EFAS factors analysis, SWOT analysis and AHP analysis. The AHP result showed that the prioritized factors in nautical tourism management including attraction, accessibility, amenities, institutional and financial literacy. The financial literacy factors (knowledge, skills and confidence) and institutional factors are important to be noticed in order to empower coastal community to develop nautical tourism. © 2022, ASERS Publishing House.

AB  - Low business outlook due to poor financial decisions among students has continued to attract interest of financial educators and professionals. Previous studies have interrogated financial literacy with sparse attention given to business risk-taking among students' start-ups in Nigeria. This research gap forms the basis of this study. The aim of this paper is the interrogation of financial knowledge and financial behavior as a lever for business risk-taking among start-up students of the University of Lagos, Nigeria. The philosophical perspective drew insight from the positivist approach with a random sampling of 145 final-year students selected from the departments of Business Administration, Accounting and Employment, and Labour Relations of the Faculty of Management Sciences. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and Bartlett's test were conducted to determine sample adequacy. Regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. The results show that financial knowledge and behavior of start-ups revealed a high propensity to be engaged in business risk-taking (β = .407, t (511) = 7.556, p < 0.05; β = .412, t (1.511) = 7.525, p < 0.05) with males showing more financial literacy understanding for business risk than females (β = .591, t (2;510) = 4.381, p < 0.05; β = .280, t (2;510) = 2.217, p = 0.262) respectively. The findings show the need for the continuous development of students' start-up behavioral and attitudinal disposition, especially females in becoming more financial literate for appropriate financial decision-making in business risk-taking and venture creation. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

AB  - The rapid evolution of technology and a large number of smartphone users are transforming the way the masses access financial services. Fintech companies consistently innovate in developing customized products and services for users and SMEs to increase financial access and inclusiveness to achieve the Indonesian national financial inclusion target of 90 percent by 2024. Access to digital financial products via Fintech contributes to greater financial inclusion for SMEs, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which restricted economic activities. Using an extended TAM model, this study explores the driving factors of Fintech adoption for Indonesian SMEs during the COVID-19 outbreak. Data analysis of 415 respondents was conducted utilizing Smart-PLS 3.0 software. The findings confirm perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, government support, trust, and user innovativeness to have a direct positive effect on the intention of SMEs to adopt Fintech. The result also reveals that financial literacy indirectly correlates with Fintech adoption mediated by user innovativeness. This indicates that Fintech could contribute to bridging financial inclusion where SMEs with lower financial literacy can utilize financial products and services via Fintech. This is a positive contribution of Fintech for SMEs in developing economies. The present study suggests that policymakers could foster the expansion of Fintech business infrastructure to improve access to SME financial services. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Young investors in Indonesia face an uptrend of awareness toward sustainable investment (SI) especially in this era where critical issues such as climate change is major. It is crucial to understand their motivations and interest during their complex decision-making process regarding the company’s ESG’s issues in their investment activities. Hence why, the question arises “Why do some young investors in Indonesia integrate sustainable investment in their portfolio?” remains largely unresolved. Previous research is still limited when it comes to non-professional individual investor’s financial behaviour. Therefore, this study builds hypotheses that are tested through online surveys conducted in Indonesia and analysed using statistical software SPSS to gain insights on the correlation of the investor’s decision-making process in SI. The results show a strong positive influence on investor’s financial literacy with their sustainability information and the usage of negative screening strategy towards their SI decision. Whilst a strong negative towards herding behaviour, which implies young investors have significant personal attitudes toward environmental, social and governance concerns in the company that they invest in. The research contributes to studies on young individual investors' decision-making, especially their way of diversifying their portfolio. It examines the factors that influence the usage of sustainability data and the choice to invest in sustainable businesses. Copyright 2023 GMP Press and Printing.

AB  - Purpose: Considering the importance of financial literacy (FL) in people’s lives the goal of this study aims to assess the level of FL of young Portuguese students, addressing the impact of the level of education on the FL of college students. Design/methodology/approach: Data from a non-probabilistic sample of 185 students attending higher education bachelor’s and master’s degrees courses in Economics, Management and Marketing was collected between February 25 and March 23, 2019, using an online questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed using IBM SPSS 25 to analyze the data. Findings: The findings show that the level of the degree (bachelor’s or master’s degree) and the academic background of the individual’s parents have a positive impact on FL. Moreover, among individuals with a high level of FL, gender and professional situation are additional predictors. Furthermore, the authors observed that the level of FL of Portuguese students attending higher education is overall low, especially in terms of their knowledge of the main financial concepts, which may call for public policies to be implemented so that to reduce this vulnerability. Research limitations/implications: Among limitations is the limited sample collected, restricted to a particular target, Portuguese students attending business-related courses such as Economics, Management and Marketing, either studying for a master’s or bachelor’s degree. This issue restricts the generalization of the overall findings to other students studying different fields. Future studies can collect a random and representative sample. Practical implications: This study test can be replicated to generate a diagnosis in any region or country, identifying how financially literate the region under analysis is. Also, this can be done to verify the evolution of FL after educational interventions. Social implications: FL is an important competence. In fact, youngsters in the whole world have been suffering from a lack of financial knowledge (FK), and some characteristics of them can push them into indebtedness, and, even bankruptcy, such as a higher level of status consumption, the tendency to have an attitude of self-appraisal, to be self-centered, to seek instant gratification. This study helps to lead to a better understanding of this phenomenon. Originality/value: Addressing college students attending different levels is an add-on to the existing body of literature. This paper contributes to study differences in FL between college and master students, enlightening and evaluating the role of scholarship maturity on financial education. Furthermore, some of the findings challenge the extant knowledge regarding the influence of professional experience, gender and age on the level of FK that students have. Finally, the current approach is innovative as it addresses FK, FL and numeracy in the same study. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study intends to examine and analyze the influence of financial literacy on people's behavior and the difference in financial literacy and behavior based on gender. The population of this research comprises students in higher education institutions in Jakarta and were selected using the snowball sampling technique. This study utilizes the survey technique by distributing questionnaires to the sample population, and the variance-based structural equation model (SEM) was used to statistically analyze the responses. After deliberating the results, this study concludes that males have better financial literacy and behavior than females; financial literacy can intervene in the association between gender and money-related behavior. This means males tend to manage their money when they are financially knowledgeable. Based on this evidence, higher education institutions must set personal financial management as mandatory and elective subjects for business and non-business departments in their curriculum, respectively.  © 2023 Conscientia Beam.

AB  - The need for security and protection of human life and health is the very cornerstone behind life insurance demand which has become larger with the current COVID-19 atmosphere. Life insurance penetration is significantly lower in Bulgaria compared to the EU average, while studies on the subject of how this development came about are almost absent. In that regard, this article is focused on the influence of major macroeconomic, demographic and competitive factors over life insurance penetration in Bulgaria. When it comes to the methodological aspect, the study is based on the theory of demand and industrial organisation by applying the descriptive and correlation analysis methods. The results underline that despite the positive trends in life gross premiums, written for the period of 2009-2020, Bulgarians prefer to allocate their excess funds towards alternative investment opportunities. To a large extent, this is attributed to the low amount of income and the low productivity of the economy as well as because of the lack of effective competition between the small number of insurance companies. From the customers’ point of view, this leads to a lack of awareness of the benefits of insurance, distrust and the absence of insurance interest, all of which are intensified during COVID-19. Responding to the market in relation to new business, supplying flexible, personalised and hybrid varieties of products, omni-channelling and development of positive attitudes among the population are all regarded as basic guidelines, used to improve insurance penetration. This article, therefore, serves as a foundation for a more in-depth study of the Bulgarian life insurance market, a stimulus for increasing the financial literacy of the Bulgarian populace and a subject of interest for insurance companies themselves in their fight to promote activity and to unleash market potential. © 2022, Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite.

AB  - This study examines digital financial inclusion and uses Fintech for informal micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to overcome the financing gap. The researchers used primarily qualitative methods, namely a qualitative analysis strategy verification through inductive analysis. The results show that Indonesia’s fintech landscape makes MSME a driver of the digital economy so that they can overcome the financing gap in the informal sector. The challenges faced by Fintech in encouraging MSME business efficiency in the form of unbalanced agency distribution, data security, data access problems, low digital financial literacy, low connectivity, and interoperability can be overcome by taking advantage of existing opportunities. These opportunities include the role of MFIs and cooperatives in promoting financial inclusion and the development of telecommunications infrastructure networks in Indonesia. The novelty of this research is the comprehensive evaluation of achieved progress in digital financial inclusion for MSMEs in Indonesia and the developed recommendation for regulations by relevant authorities to encourage the business efficiency of MSMEs through facilitating digital financial inclusion. © 2023, Institute of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

AB  - Coffee is one of Indonesia’s leading commodities that has opportunities in the domestic and international markets. Processed coffee drinks are now increasingly favored by people from various circles, so that the growth of national coffee consumption continues to increase. However, the fate of coffee farmers is not directly proportional to the trend of increasing Indonesian people’s coffee consumption. The purpose of this study was to analyze financial literacy and coffee marketing strategies as well as the institutional model of coffee farming in Jember Regency, especially cooperative of KSU Ketakasi. The research methodology used is explanatory research. This study was carried out at some stages: field studies/surveys (to uncover and unravel the problems of coffee farming), analysis of marketing strategy, and analysis of business institutional models. The research results showed that; (a) the level of financial literacy in accessing financing sources is still very low; (b) the mudharaba and musyarakah financing scheme is more appropriate for KSU Ketakasi to finance coffee farmers; and (c) KSU Ketakasi has implemented a marketing mix consisting of product, promotion, price, and location. In addition, KSU Ketakasi has established a cooperative to accommodate the harvest of coffee from farmers and sell it to buyers. Although the institutional body is still simple, KSU Ketakasi has been able to contribute to Jember Regency in the form of foreign exchange for the local government. © 2022, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality.

AB  - Purpose: The paper aims to provide insights into executives' perceptions of risk management disclosures and such disclosures' determinants. The paper extends the emerging literature by using institutional theories in the context of a developing country. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 36 executives directly involved in risk management disclosures, policy-making and monitoring. Findings: The interview data show evidence that corporate risk management disclosures are still at a low level. The reasons for non-disclosure can be related to institutional weaknesses, lack of disciplinary action and political interference. Additionally, central bank autonomy, limited perception of accountability, demand from influential stakeholders, lack of financial literacy, aim to keep annual reports brief, etc. results in the dearth of risk disclosure by the banks. Research limitations/implications: The study suggests that understanding the importance of risk management disclosures and preparing for the uncertainty will keep the business moving. Originality/value: The study seeks to contribute to the literature by investigating the executives' perceptions of risk management disclosures and its' determinants in the context of a developing country where non-compliance to the regulatory standard is high. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Nonprofit organizations and regional universities have increasingly offered professional development opportunities for potential personal finance teachers as states and school districts have increasingly required high school students to take personal finance courses. Yet, current measures on teacher confidence and dispositions shadow these updates. This article employs unique data on high school teachers to estimate their confidence levels, professional development take-up, and attitudes about teaching personal finance courses in schools. The results show that 95% of teachers are confident in teaching personal finance. Teachers with licensure outside of business or economics were more likely to take up professional development in personal finance instruction. Meanwhile, 86% of teachers support a graduation requirement for personal finance instruction in high school. These findings suggest that high schools have the capacity to teach personal finance but also underscore the need for low-cost, easily accessible professional development opportunities. © 2023 Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education.

AB  - The primary purpose of this paper is to explore and discuss the role of Fintech in the transformation of Malaysian banking services. The research design is qualitative and secondary source analysis is conducted. Secondary data is collected from relevant journal articles, research papers, editorials, websites and official documents. Based on the analysis, it is concluded that different key drivers played an influential role in the progress of the Fintech industry in Malaysia. Financial literacy programs and Malaysia Stack are some notable initiatives that support the Fintech progress in Malaysia. A range of Fintech businesses is operating in Malaysia that are transforming different banking services including payments solutions, lending personal loans, credit cards, personal finance management solutions and one-stop-shop online banking. Underserved populations, flexible regulatory environment and increased level of interest of state authorities are some of the critical aspects for the future progress of Fintech business in Malaysia. The research paper explains the role of Fintech businesses in the Malaysian banking industry. Many have viewed Fintech as a disruptive technology, however, this study highlighted that Malaysian banking services are transformed by Fintech business and there are still opportunities for the progress of the Fintech industry in Malaysia. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.

AB  - Purpose: The recent financial crises and the economic problems caused by the pandemic highlight the importance of financial literacy (FL). Libraries have an essential role in developing informational literacy and promoting access to information. In this study the authors seek to identify, based on the published literature, in which areas and in what roles libraries engage in the development of FL, and what options are available for those who intend to set out in this direction in the near future. Design/methodology/approach: The basis of the research is a review of the literature, as comprehensive as possible, achieved by keyword- and discipline-focused searches run in the Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts (LISTA), the Web of Science (WoS) and the Scopus database. At the beginning of the study, the initial list of results had 765 publications, but this number decreased significantly after removing duplicates and sorting the results. Finally, 138 publications were included in the analysis. Findings: Libraries engage in the development of FL mostly through their collections, with recommendations, through education, by organizing programs and through information service. Most successful methods do not require any specialized FL knowledge from librarians. Necessary competences are more related to organizational skills, cooperation with partners and creativity. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on publications which include the term financial culture, any of its synonyms, or broader or more specific terms and which are related to libraries in the manner described in the search strategy. The international literature databases chosen for the searches limited the scope of the articles available for inclusion. Originality/value: The study summarizes the results in libraries related to FL from the past 10 years. There has been no other similar summary published recently applicable in practice. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper primarily aims to determine the demographic and socio-economic characteristics affecting households’ investment choices in Tanzania using data from the FinScope survey which was done in 2017. The study employed multivariate analytical technique. The results of the paper reveal that increase in education level lowers the likelihood of individual household to invest in informal groups as well as agricultural ventures. Also, the study shows that men are more risk averse and less likely to invest in the informal groups, investment accounts as well as personal businesses. It is also revealed that urban households may easily access financial products due to the presence of a good number of financial institutions located in urban compared to rural areas, and that urban households rarely participate in agricultural activities due to lack of enough land in townships. Finally, the paper confirms that employed households are more likely to make a good financial decision because most of them are believed to have good education which enable them to access formal financial literacy education. Consequently, the study opines that, because most of households, as revealed in the survey from which the employed dataset is based, are hailing from rural settings where agriculture is the main economic activity, we establish that agricultural ventures require a complete revamp for Tanzania to become a middle-income economy through its industrialization agenda. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are among the cornerstones of the Indonesian economy that managed to survive the world crisis. The development of MSMEs also demands that owners be ready to compete with other MSMEs. This study aims to analyze whether business sustainability is influenced by financial literacy with financial behavior and financial technology as mediators. The research sample includes owners and managers of MSMEs in Indonesia, totaling 342 respondents. Data collection methods used are non-probability sampling techniques by distributing questionnaires. This study uses SEM analysis with PLS analysis tools. It was found that financial literacy does not directly affect business sustainability but affects financial behavior and financial technology. Financial behavior and financial technology are proven to influence business sustainability. Furthermore, financial behavior and financial technology mediate the effect of financial literacy on business sustainability. The results of this study show that financial behavior and financial technology can fully mediate the relationship between financial literacy and business sustainability. Moreover, financial literacy cannot directly affect business sustainability, which must be fully mediated by financial behavior and financial technology. This study also provides practical value regarding the sustainability of MSMEs. Thus, companies can survive in the long term not only with a robust financial literacy foundation but they must be supported by good financial behavior and also be able to choose the right financial technology in their business activities. © Bambang Widagdo, Chalimatuz Sa’diyah, 2023.

AB  - Tourism in Terengganu deals with attractions, events, and facilities of special interest to tourists, such as Kuala Terengganu City Centre (KTCC). KTCC is a collaboration project between the Terengganu state government and the East-Cost Economic Region Development (ECERD) agency. This project purposely attracts potential foreign investors and upgrades the community's economy and social well-being in rural dan sub-urban areas in Kuala Terengganu. Therefore, this study analyzes the factors that influence the business performance among Malay micro-entrepreneurs in rural and sub-urban areas of Kuala Terengganu. The study utilized four factors, including entrepreneurial competency, financial literacy, innovation, and technology. In this survey research, non-probability has been chosen by using the purposive sampling methods. The data were collected from Malay micro-entrepreneurs operating their business, including the North and South areas of KTCC. The results showed that entrepreneurial competency and technology factors were significantly affected business performance. Meanwhile, the financial literacy and innovation factors were not significantly affected business performance among Malay micro-entrepreneurs. In general, this study's findings indicated that most Malay entrepreneurs are not concerned about the importance of managing their finance and creating innovative products in the competitive areas. Also, KTCC is a project that can benefit those Malay micro-entrepreneurs who wisely grab the opportunities. Therefore, they need to consider other entrepreneurial factors that can further develop their business performance without relying on the government and other stakeholders. © 2022 by ASERS® Publishing.

AB  - The research aims to investigate the entrepreneurial skills and financial literacy’s impact on the improved performance in the biotechnology sector. Entrepreneurial skills enable the individual to manage the business through taking essential actions, and along with financial literacy the utilization of resources in an optimum way is assured as well. The decision maker would invest in development of organizational capabilities required to succeed in market. Being a high risky domain, the utilization of financial resources through financial knowledge is crucial in biotech sector. To conduct this research, the quantitative research design including survey approach has been adopted. Questionnaires were distributed followed by the statistical testing of data through SPSS. The results indicated a significant association among financial literacy and performance along with a significant association between entrepreneurial skills and performance of biotechnology firms in Swiss. The research holds greater theoretical and practical importance. This study suggests that financial learning and entrepreneurial skills pioneer the development of biotech firms by having a higher speed of innovation. Regarding its implications for public authorities, the substantial need to promote FL and ES is highlighted. Thus public policies extend entrepreneurial skills and financing knowledge by improving the decision-making process. © 2023 ThinkBiotech LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Firm innovation relies heavily on financing, which is why it is a hot topic in the fields of finance and innovation management. Organizations can make strategic investments in production factors to develop competitive advantages because they have access to financial resources. This study investigated how financial literacy, innovativeness, and environmental sustainability influence the sustainability of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This was set as the primary objective in order to better understand the nature of the impact of financial literacy and innovation on the sustainability of SME firms. To test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied using data collected from 300 small businesses firms in China. The results revealed that financial literacy and innovativeness significantly influence small firms’ sustainability. Additionally, social inclusion significantly affects small firms’ sustainability, and sequentially has a significant effect on their performance. Research findings suggested that small businesses incorporate sustainability models into their operations and enhance financial knowledge in order to maintain sustainability. Copyright © 2022 Tang.

AB  - The convergence of social capital and financial intelligence becomes a dynamic catalyst in the realm of post-pandemic challenges, promoting entrepreneurial financial performance to unforeseen levels as businesses use networks, knowledge, and financial expertise to overcome challenges and grasp new opportunities. Hence, the study explores the factors that influence entrepreneurial financial performance of employees in Pakistan’s corporate sector. Using two theoretical frameworks, Regulatory Focus Theory and Rubicon Four-Phase Action Model in Entrepreneurship, study identifies essential traits for entrepreneurship and their direct correlation with financial success. The study utilized a survey questionnaire to gather responses from 276 employees of the corporate sector involved in entrepreneurial activities. The findings suggest that financial literacy, financial risk tolerance, entrepreneurial competency, and social capital positively impact an entrepreneur’s locus of control and financial intelligence. Financial literacy equips entrepreneurs with necessary skills and knowledge to manage finances effectively, identify potential financial risks, and increase profitability. Financial risk tolerance enables entrepreneurs to understand financial markets better and make sound financial decisions. Entrepreneurial competency leads to sound financial decision-making and control of financial outcomes. Social capital provides valuable resources, information, and support to improve financial decision-making skills. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In Hungarian libraries, the development of financial literacy (FL) is either not present at all or is very low in intensity. The Hungarian government strategy does not involve libraries in FL development. Based on the dissemination of information and digital literacy, there are numerous good examples worldwide proving that libraries, reaching all of their users, can effectively take part in financial education and, built thereon, business development and business information services. This can increase their social recognition and even supplement their funding. In 2022, for the first time in the country, the authors conducted a survey among Hungarian librarians to assess the current situation, to identify what hinders the expansion of services related to FL, and what tasks should be performed and what innovations should be introduced in libraries. The survey also seeks to define which fields of competence are to be acquired by librarians. It also reveals the forms of external professional cooperation that are necessary to organise library programmes strengthening financial awareness. The results provide valuable information not only for Hungary, but also internationally, since they showcase the challenges that the library system of a former socialist country in Europe faces after three decades of market economy in this current, market- and profit-oriented world. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - In order to survive in this complex economic business environment with fierce competition among various players of the finance sector, the need is to understand the even more complex financial behaviour of the customers. We apply the support vector machine classifier, a machine learning algorithm to construct a nonlinear model which classifies the customers into good and bad class based on their respective positive and negative saving behaviour. With the help of web-based survey, a sample of urban banking millennial was collected and preprocessed to apply the support vector machine classifier technique. Pattern recognition from data and its prediction for the financial behaviour are based on the machine learning forecasts. Moreover, the comparative analysis of the weightage of the three attributes, namely income level, financial literacy and behavioural characteristic, is carried out and it is analysed for the savings/wealth accumulation of the millennial generation to understand the financial distress among the said generation in context. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Capitalising on the food and fibre opportunities of a burgeoning global population requires a high performing and resilient agribusiness sector. Necessarily, this includes a business focus to identify opportunities and implement strategies to ensure the delivery of food and fibre products demanded by the global marketplace while managing impacts of a dynamic operating environment. Current agriculture policy in Australia recognises the varying capacity of rural businesses to thrive in this environment and provides both indirect and direct welfare support. One example is the provision of a publicly funded financial counselling service to rural business in financial stress. This research has used interpretive description to better understand the drivers of the financial hardship experienced by businesses accessing the Rural Financial Counselling Service (RFCS). Guided interviews were conducted with 32 Rural financial Counsellors (RFC) who had at least five years experience in the role. Thematic analysis of the interviews highlighted the social, environmental and financial complexities impacting the successful operations of a rural business. The key finding of this research is that despite the myriad influences impacting businesses in this cohort, business failure reflected a lack of business skills, which could be aggregated under the umbrella terminology of business acumen. These skills are more nuanced than simply poor financial literacy, extending to the manner in which business operators understand the fundamentals of their business environment and are able to intervene to maximise the opportunities and mitigate the threats. Consequently, decision-makers focussed on production preferentially to the business of capitalising on that production. The research identified opportunities for research relating to the challenge of enhancing the business acumen of rural business decision-makers, as well as illuminating the business and social context of gender in rural business sustainability. © 2022

AB  - Commercial rangeland livestock producers manage a perpetual conflict. They must ensure that the financial and environmental elements of rangeland grazing remain concurrently robust, with neither borrowing excessively from the other. Successfully managing this financial and environmental tension requires sound financial literacy as it applies to pastoralism, an above-average knowledge of rangeland ecology, and intellectual and practical management skills. Achieving these competencies is the starting point for a truly sustainable rangeland grazing business. The degree to which these competencies are achieved is largely under the control of the people who manage the business. However, there are significant external influences that can impede progress towards better financial and environmental outcomes. In this paper, we draw upon more than 50 years of combined professional experience to present our definitions for financial and environmental sustainability, as they pertain to northern Australian grazing enterprises. We summarise what is currently known about the financial and environmental performance of the northern Australian beef industry, and highlight some of the current external factors that are potentially antagonistic to achieving sustainable livestock production. We conclude with a protocol that our most successful clients have used to achieve (and demonstrate) financial and environmental sustainability. © 2023 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - This study aims to test financial literacy and credit conditions in determining formal credit access to determine the performance of MSMEs. This research includes the type of associative research that is accompanied by hypothesis testing. This research was conducted on MSMEs of as many as 324 creative industry players in four cities in East Java (Mojokerto, Pasuruan, Gresik, and Sidoarjo) with a sample size of 100 actors who had accessed formal credit using the stratified random sampling method for data collection. The results of Smart PLS analysis show that financial literacy and credit terms directly and significantly affect access to formal credit and MSME performance; formal credit access directly and significantly affects MSME performance. Likewise, financial literacy and credit terms indirectly affect the performance of MSMEs. These results mean that financial literacy and credit terms have a strategic role in explaining why access to formal credit is growing and is attracting MSMEs to strengthen capital to improve performance. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Farmers’ entrepreneurship is an important factor in promoting rural economic growth, yet few studies have systematically discussed the impact of financial literacy. Using the 2021 China Land Economic Survey data, this study analyzes the relationship between financial literacy and Chinese rural households’ entrepreneurship from the perspective of credit constraints and risk preferences by the IV-probit, stepwise regression, and moderating effects methods. This study finds that: (1) the financial literacy of Chinese farmers is low, with only 11.2% of the sample households starting businesses; and (2) Financial literacy can promote rural households’ entrepreneurship. After introducing an instrument variable to control endogenous problems, the positive correlation is still significant; (3) financial literacy effectively alleviates the traditional credit constraints of farmers, thereby promoting entrepreneurship; (4) risk preference weakens the positive impact of financial literacy on rural households’ entrepreneurship. This study provides a reference for optimizing entrepreneurship policies. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to determine the contribution of financial skills to entrepreneurial intentions among women involved in university education. Design/methodology/approach: Clustering and logistic regression analyses were used to infer the determinants and motivators of entrepreneurial intention in a sample of women students at a Spanish online university. Findings: Financial and numerical skills could play a significant role in boosting entrepreneurial culture, overcoming reticence and increasing awareness of business opportunities, particularly when women are motivated to increase their autonomy and income. The study offers meaningful implications for policymakers. Research limitations/implications: Further research will be needed before these conclusions may be inferred to other settings and circumstances. Comparison with a similar sample of potential male entrepreneurs may also be necessary to deduce the influence of gender. Practical implications: The introduction of certain financial content into the education system by governments and policymakers would produce remarkable results on entrepreneurship intention among women. Social implications: Relational capital and positive social influences also contribute to mitigating the effects of risk aversion, one of the main barriers for potential female entrepreneurs. Originality/value: The role of financial literacy in entrepreneurial intention among women has scarcely been addressed in academic research. The literature also has paid little attention to the analysis of what motivates women into entrepreneurship, and whether women who decide to embark on a business venture show different profiles. The aim of this study is to contribute to closing these gaps, exploring the effect of cognitive skills, personality traits, contextual factors and motivations. © 2021, Josep Llados-Masllorens and Elisabet Ruiz-Dotras.

AB  - Covid-19 has significantly disrupted and devastated the world's economy. Data from Malaysia shows that more than 30,000 companies have closed their operations since the movement control order (MCO) implementation due to Covid-19 that began in March 2020. However, the effects on small businesses are especially severe, mainly due to the higher vulnerability levels and lower resilience related to their size. This study provides an empirical analysis of the key drivers leading to the business resilience of small businesses in Malaysia that have survived the Covid-19 pandemic. Data from 215 small businesses were collected physically and online across Malaysia from May 2021 to December 2021. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using Smart PLS 3.2.4 was used to analyse the data, whereby nine hypotheses were tested in the current study. The results showed that technology acceptance, government support, and financial literacy significantly influence business resilience among small businesses in Malaysia. The results also indicated that financial literacy moderates the relationship between compliance cost and government support with business resilience. Thus, the findings revealed three important determinants of small businesses’ resilience framework, namely technology acceptance, government support, and financial literacy. The study recommends a dynamic, resilient framework to adopt in the "new normal" situation for the successful navigation of small businesses in the future. Moreover, the study provides insight into the key drivers for business resilience factors that small businesses must be concerned with, as the framework can be used to deal with not only the global pandemic but also uncertain conditions.

AB  - Purpose: First, this study aims to investigate the factors affecting entrepreneurial intentions. Second, it is to identify the influential factors with the highest influence on entrepreneurial intention. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of the current study was female employees in various hospitality firms, including restaurants, hotels and wellness services. The questionnaire was developed based on past research studies and was tested for reliability prior to the full set of data collection. To represent the early to mid-level career women in hospitality, female employees with at least one-year experience from hospitality businesses, such as restaurants and hotels, participated in the study and total usable samples were 416. Findings: The findings demonstrated that attitude toward risk-taking, self-efficacy, subjective norm and empowerment is significantly influential to the entrepreneurial intention of the women in the hospitality industry. Based on the data analysis, attitude toward risk-taking has the highest influence on entrepreneurial intention. In other words, with a positive attitude toward risk-taking, female employees showed the greatest tendency to start their own business. Research limitations/implications: The current study extended the theory of planned behavior in that it can be used to explain the women’s entrepreneurial intention with subjective norms, attitudes and self-efficacy. The study also highlighted the flexibility of the theory in allowing the researchers to add external variables to help further investigate the relationships among all the factors in the models. Practical implications: To highlight the opportunity to promote more equality and diversity in the business management environments, the results from the study promoted the roles of women entrepreneurs to support hospitality business development. One of the most influential factors is the attitude toward risk-taking. This suggested that with the positive attitude toward risk, the respondents have higher entrepreneurial intentions. Promoting and sharing the success stories of female entrepreneurs can affect the attitude of female employees and raise their interests toward becoming entrepreneurs. Originality/value: The current study provided a unique investigation on the early to mid-level career hospitality female employees to explore their intention to be entrepreneurs. This research offered the extension of the theory of planned behavior in the context of entrepreneurship. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The growing uncertainty in today's business environment has a significant influence on social business's behaviour. Those enterprises could rely on public support in the past, but nowadays, they have to find a way to be more responsible about their social activity and be financially independent on public resources. Based on this theoretical background, the paper's main goal was to find a set of factors that influence crucial financial decisions within a crisis. When social businesses create an optimal financial portfolio to be financially sustainable, primary research was conducted. A sample of 57 social businesses was asked about their financial strategy. The main research goal was to compare a change before and after the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic situation in 2020. This case has shown current financial thinking and preparedness for unusual or crises. A mixed research approach was chosen due to a limited number of respondents. The overall results found that those businesses prefer to use the current strategy (42%) in crisis, and they limit investments to survive in that situation, except marketing investments (16%). Implications for Central European audience: At the theoretical level, our study shows social enterprise concepts in the Central European context, which differs somewhat from the already established definition of mainly Anglo-Saxon and American authors. At the same time, it combines knowledge about the use of financial planning in this segment. The study results show that financial planning is essential in these companies because it can achieve social goals. A discussion would be opened on how to raise awareness of the preparation of the strategy. Alternatively, how to strengthen the financial literacy of managers or representatives of these entities. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Like in many other developing countries, microfinance programmes in Myanmar have become an avenue to reduce poverty. This research examines whether microfinance in Myanmar has empowered female clients compared to non-microfinance clients, in terms of: (i) general decision-making (children’s education, family planning, children’s marriage, health care); and (ii) financial decision-making (income utilisation, loan usage, savings, investment). Primary data was collected using a questionnaire survey to achieve the research objectives. The sample of the survey consists of two groups of women living in the Ayeyarwady region, Myanmar: (i) Beneficiaries of microfinance programmes, and (ii) non-beneficiaries of any microfinance institutions. Female clients either started a new business or expanded/diversified an existing business using microfinance, which helped to increase income and savings. Overall, 89.8% of microfinance clients have gained significant empowerment (in making general and financial decisions combined). The discriminant analysis based on four indicators-children’s education, children’s marriage, savings, and investment-shows that the decision-making power of microfinance clients has improved compared to non-clients. The government should actively promote a microfinance ecosystem through robust microfinance institutional frameworks including, microfinance institutions, intermediaries, and local government agencies. Financial literacy awareness campaigns should be organised frequently to promote wider women’s participation in microfinance programmes. © 2022, Faculty of Economics and Administration.

AB  - There is a socially constructed perception that people with mental illnesses do not have the resilience to endure the pressures of the capitalist model of work. Solidarity economy (se) appears as an alternative for the inclusion of mentally ill people in the realm of work and productivity, enabling them to (re)produce their subjectivities. In this study, we develop a critical reflection on the possibilities of entrepreneuring, solidarity economy, and financial/accounting literacy as tools towards a health promotion strategy that empowers and allows the emancipation of these individuals, so that they may (re)write their stories and give society an account of themselves other than their mental illness. This paper starts from the analysis of the experience of two Brazilian se ventures engaged in mental health promotion, in which we proposed and conducted a financial education program aimed at providing se worker-members with tools to actively participate in discussions about financial and accounting-related decisions. Afterwards, we engaged in an action research exercise, building on lessons learned: the importance of abandoning preconceived ideas of mental illness and relying on sharing experiences and participation; and how real-life struggles are a source of knowledge, as discussed through the concept of “learning by doing.”. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - Recognition of useful opportunities is very crucial for small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs') survival and growth in the competitive environment. However, the majority of SMEs cannot easily recognize new opportunities in the turbulent markets due to a lack of managerial competencies and knowledge. Several studies have been carried out to unleash the determinants of opportunity recognition that configure SMEs' success, but the results are disjointed. In particular, the mediating role of opportunity recognition between business experience, financial literacy, and SME performance has been missed. This study aims to test if either financially literate or experienced managers can recognize new opportunities that result in high performance. For testing the hypotheses, we surveyed 232 Pakistani SMEs from the manufacturing, trading, and service sectors. After performing the structural equation modeling, we found that financial literacy and business experience are the substantial prognosticators of opportunity recognition and SMEs' performance. Opportunity recognition shows a partial mediating role between financial literacy and SMEs performance as well as between business experience and SMEs performance. However, this research endorses that business experience is more vital for high performance as compared to financial literacy whereas in terms of opportunity recognition financial literacy is more crucial as compared to experience. This study recommends the enterprises to hire the financially literate and experienced managers as both display a prominent role in the identification of opportunities and high performance. Further implications are discussed. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

AB  - The failure rate of small medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) is very high in South Africa. One of the challenges faced by SMMEs is inaccessibility to external finance. There is a general low level of financial literacy amongst small business owners in South Africa leading to ill-informed financial decisions. Financial literacy is an important knowledge resource for financial decision-making but little research has focused on how financial literacy affects the performance of SMMEs. The aim of the study was to examine if financial literacy moderates the relationship between access to finance and performance of SMMEs in South Africa. The cross-sectional survey method was used for data collection in a quantitative study. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation and hierarchical regression were used for data analysis. The Cronbach’s alpha was used as a measure of reliability. The findings indicated that the relationship between access to finance and financial literacy is significant. The findings also showed that financial literacy moderates the relationship between access to finance and performance of SMMEs. Empirically, the study added to the body of literature on financial literacy, access to finance and performance of SMMEs. Practically, recommendations to improve the financial literacy of SMMEs are suggested. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using new long-run microdata, this article studies wealth and income trends of households with a college degree (college households) and without a college degree (noncollege households) in the United States since 1956. We document the emergence of a substantial college wealth premium since the 1980s, which is considerably larger than the college income premium. Over the past four decades, the wealth of college households has tripled. By contrast, the wealth of noncollege households has barely grown in real terms over the same period. Part of the rising wealth gap can be traced back to systematic portfolio differences between college and noncollege households that give rise to different exposures to asset price changes. Noncollege households have lower exposure to the equity market and have profited much less from the recent surge in the stock market. We also discuss the importance of financial literacy and business ownership for the increase in wealth inequality between college and noncollege households. © 2020, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

AB  - Digital financial services (DFSs), being financial services accessed and delivered through digital channels, have grown rapidly in South Africa as well as globally. The adoption of the technology for DFSs has led to an increase in financial inclusion, enabling more individuals and businesses to have access to useful and affordable financial products and services, where payments, savings, credit, investment and insurance are included. Through the Financial Sector Regulation Act 9 of 2017 financial inclusion was statutorily enacted for the first time. The regulators are now empowered to insist that financial institutions take proactive steps to expand financial inclusion and can take the necessary steps to enforce these powers. One of the factors that have an influence on whether consumers will adopt DFSs is consumers’ perspectives of DFSs. Lack of information and knowledge combined with the cost of data negatively influences the adoption of DFSs. The transfer of information to unbanked people in South Africa with regards to DFSs should be enhanced by the state as it strives to improve financial literacy. DFSs are susceptible to financial crimes like fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, corruption and market abuse. The challenges that threaten the interests of customers should be addressed by stricter information verification methods when transacting with clients online. Technological detectors and digital identification should be used more effectively to verify customers and to alert authorities to suspicious transactions. Financial institutions might consider authenticating online transactions by thumb-print or a voice recognition system. This paper emphasises that because of the prospects of greater and deeper financial inclusion in South Africa, the use of DFSs has to be improved and developed and the challenges have to be constructively addressed to unleash the true potential thereof. © 2021, North-West Unversity.

AB  - The lockdowns and restrictions imposed to control COVID-19 have made life miserable for people, especially those involved in informal economic activities. The pandemic induced financial hardships, caused financial anxiety and financial stress among informal sector participants. This study aimed to measure and analyze the financial stress and financial insecurity of one of the important informal sector elements (street vendors) in India. Street vendors in Bangalore were interviewed in this descriptive research through personal interaction and telephonic interviews. The collected primary data were processed using SPSS statistical package. The results have indicated that the pandemic inflicted financial stress on street vendors irrespective of their gender, marital status, age, education, monthly income, and type of product dealt. Financial stress levels varied depending on the number of dependents of street vendors and their business nature. Financial literacy differed according to street vendors' marital status. A person becomes extremely sensitive and cautious in personal finance matters on getting married. Financial stress and financial literacy correlated negatively. 89.5% of street vendors perceived that they had financial insecurity in the future due to this pandemic. The results indicated that financial stress and financial literacy did not affect financial insecurity perceptions of street vendors. The predictors of financial insecurity have been marital status and the number of dependents of the street vendors (r2: 16.6%). However, marital status alone impacted the 6% variance in financial insecurity. This study concluded that the pandemic caused financial stress and financial insecurity among street vendors, but not financial stress and financial literacy.  © Thangaraj Ravikumar, Mali Sriram, S Girish, R Anuradha, M Gnanendra, 2022.

AB  - The concept of entrepreneurship has evolved significantly in the last decade and is identified as a competence rather than as a skill, comprising many different behaviours, attributes and skills, including empathy, creativity, financial literacy, taking initiatives and identifying opportunities. The Entrepcomp framework outlined by the EU Commission in 2016 highlighted that entrepreneurship focused on all aspects of society, not just business. It defined entrepreneurship as “the value that is created, financial, cultural, or social”. The importance of entrepreneurship as a key facet of life has reinvented how it should be taught, leading to collaborative pedagogical models that facilitate the exchange, flow and co-creation of knowledge between HEIs, businesses and communities. This article identifies the need for collaborative pedagogical models to develop entrepreneurial skills. It explores if a hybrid of design thinking and problem-based learning can satisfy the needs of entrepreneurship education in contemporary society. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Undergraduates are expected to be future leaders responsible for business and nations. Given that sound financial decision-making is critical to their success in their careers and lives, it is important to understand the money-management behaviour of undergraduates. In the context of developing countries, the body of knowledge on money-management behaviour is dominated by functional financial literature and there is little research on factors beyond this. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring economic, social and psychological factors that influence money-management behaviour of undergraduates in a developing nation (Sri Lanka) and how undergraduates respond to these influences. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a qualitative exploratory approach. Data collection was carried out using focus group discussions and individual interviews amongst undergraduates in a leading Sri Lankan state university. Findings: The results indicate that undergraduates adopted both careful and risky money-management approaches. The subthemes, specifically identified under economic, social and psychological factors, revealed how undergraduates responded to each of these factors and the influence of contextual and cultural differences in their money-management behaviour. Research limitations/implications: Findings of the study revealed the importance of promoting innovative educational strategies to change the dependability mindset of undergraduates and to promote stress-management strategies that will assist them to enhance their personalities and creativity in making financial decisions. Theoretical and practical implications and future research directions are provided. Originality/value: The literature scores in developing context are limited to exploring the existing pattern and the levels of the functional financial literacy. This study has deepened the authors’ understanding of how the developing context affects undergraduates’ response to the factors relating to their money-management behaviour. The findings from this study will be useful to government, financial institutions, educational institutions, parents and those who have a keen interest in encouraging healthy money-management behaviour in undergraduates. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe how librarians used elements of market research, advertising and media literacy in a personal finance class. Design/methodology/approach: Librarians each semester guest lecture one session in a personal finance class “Foundations of Money Education.” Through this class, librarians present engaging material about market research and advertising in an effort to encourage students to think about how these external forces influence their spending behavior. Findings: Students appreciate learning about advertising through the engaging use of commercials. While responses were mixed as to the applicability of the topic, the majority of students agreed that the topic was a worthwhile addition to the personal finance curriculum. Originality/value: Topics such as budgets, savings, and mortgages are typically taught in personal finance classes. Teaching information about market research and advertising is a topic that is usually not covered in a personal finance class. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - South Africa lags behind among other developing and emerging market economies on business start-ups. Businesses that fail in a year is averaging between 50% and 60%, a ﬁgure quite high for a country struggling with achieving sustainable economic growth to reduce unemployment, inequality and poverty. This study identifies issues hurting SMMEs that need attention from both businesses themselves as well as from policymakers. The objective of this study is to identify key business success determinants using cross-sectional data that was randomly collected from informal businesses in Johannesburg/Pretoria in South Africa from 390 informal SMMEs. Using assets ownership as a yardstick for success in an ordered logistic regression, the study finds education status, income, employment growth, centre of operation, ﬁnancial inclusion, experience, ﬁnancial literacy and advertising budget were signiﬁcant in explaining assets ownership (success) in South Africa. This study recommends that the government through its various institutions that deal speciﬁcally with small businesses come up with radical business training programmes so as to improve the ﬁnance literacy among small business. Also, small business owners should budget to fund their advertising budgets since it is found that advertising has a positive impact of ﬁrm success. © 2021 Government Technical Advisory Centre (GTAC).

AB  - Internet consumer finance platforms (ICFPs), as a new Internet financial model, have emerged and been widely adopted by Chinese as well as global online shoppers following the rapid growth of e-commerce. This emerging financial tool is, however, luring younger generations deep into debt. It jeopardizes the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1—No poverty, bringing the sustainability of this consumer financial model into question. To aid the sustainable development of ICFP industry, this paper distinguishes two antecedents of continuous use intention for ICFP users: (1) satisfaction, as a sustainable determinant; and (2) impulsive buying, as a non-sustainable determinant. We found satisfaction (b = 0.452) has a larger positive effect on continuous use intention compared to impulsive buying (b = 0.229). Therefore, ICFPs should weigh heavier on technology innovation instead of seducing consumers’ impulsive buying behavior. We also found that credit limit misconception poses the largest impact (b = 0.483) on impulsive buying. In the near term, governments and ICFPs may initiate public programs to improve ICFP users’ financial literacy in order to restrain their unsustainable impulsive buying behavior and cultivate their sustainable satisfaction on ICFP technology and service. Market regulators may build up institutional frameworks to tighten the abuse of financial platforms on credit issuing power and better foster sustainable entrepreneurship in this new financial platform business. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This exploratory mixed methods study sought to determine the financial capabilities of remittance-receiving households from two rural municipalities in the Philippines: San Nicolas in Ilocos Norte province and Moncada in Tarlac province. The broader concept of financial capabilities not only looks at people’s financial literacy but also their financial inclusion (access to financial products) and financial functionings (actions on finance). Quantitative household surveys and qualitative data gathering methods that fall under a rapid qualitative inquiry (RQI) design were employed. Results and findings show that more remittance-receiving households from San Nicolas saved, invested, and did business in their hometown compared to counterpart migrant household respondents from Moncada. Differences in migrant households’ levels of financial literacy, as well as the geographic make-up and economic activities of the two municipalities, may help explain why one municipality had more migrant investors, savers, and entrepreneurs over the other. © Scalabrini Migration Center 2021.

AB  - Purpose: The main purpose of this study is to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected from the poor who resides in rural Uganda. Structural equation modelling (SEM) through analysis of moment structures (AMOS) was used to analyze the data. Bootstrap approach with 5,000 samples was run to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Findings: The results showed that social network significantly and positively mediate the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. In addition, financial literacy also has a direct significant and positive effect on financial inclusion. Overall, the findings suggest that the presence of social network fully mediate the effect of financial literacy on financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Research limitations/implications: This study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Future studies could adopt longitudinal research design to establish the dynamic characteristics of the samples under study over time. Besides, this study collected data from only poor households who were clients of microfinance banks located in rural Uganda. It ignored the other section of the population who were not the poor. Therefore, future studies could use the other section of the population who are clients of commercial banks. Practical implications: The advocates of financial literacy and managers of microfinance banks in developing countries should ensure using existing local structures such as community and village associations to conduct financial literacy training. The village associations help in mobilizing members who are close-knit based on the existing societal ties that can be used as a channel for disseminating vital financial literacy information. Indeed, financial literacy workshops, seminars, and business clinics can be easily conducted to individuals who are members of the village associations. Originality/value: This paper integrates social network theory in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Social network acts as a conduit through which financial knowledge and skills flow to increase the scope of financial inclusion of the poor in developing countries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide new practical and theoretical insights on how SMEs adjust and further develop business competencies, innovations and performance by utilizing market orientation, learning orientation behaviors, and financial literacy. The data was collected from manufacturing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) of textile products that had several employees between 5 and 99 people in the province of Bali and Jawa, Indonesia, in 2016. Central Java as one of the provinces that has various types of creative centers has a role big as a reference model for other provinces in the development of MSMEs. The results of the study confirm the influence of financial literacy on the performance and innovation of creative MSMEs in Central Java. This has implications that with good financial literacy, it is expected that MSMEs will be able to make the right management and financial decisions to improve performance and innovation. With this finding, it is expected that significant support will emerge from the government as a regulator, academics as educators, the private sector as a catalyst, and the community as a driver for the development of financial literacy at MSMEs in Central Java. The lack of studies in the existing literature underscores the potential contribution of this subsequent study. © 2020 College of Management, National Cheng Kung University

AB  - Students of the millennial generation have several characteristics, including being wasteful in their management of money and being highly dependent on information and communication technology. These phenomena mean financial literacy is important for them, in order that they become capable, wise, and efficient individuals who are future-oriented in managing their personal finances. This study aims to create a model for developing the financial management behavior of students. It covers five variables, namely financial behavior, financial attitude, financial knowledge, social media exposure, and peer influence. By using purposive sampling and a five-point Likert scale questionnaire, this study collected data from 327 students spread across several universities in Indonesia. The results of the descriptive analysis show that the students’ financial management behavior (FMB), financial attitude, and financial knowledge are classified as good. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis using the single-composite indicator technique shows that 58% of FMB is influenced by financial exposure from social media, financial attitude, and peer influence. Social media exposure and peer influence take on a strategic nature. Financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial behavior are internal variables related to financial literacy. Further research would need to identify the external variables that have a potential influence on the internal variables of financial literacy. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper examines the impact of entrepreneurship on the efficiency of household financial portfolios by constructing Sharpe ratios and Sortino ratios of seven kinds of financial assets, based on data from the 2013, 2015 and 2017 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), in conjunction with the returns of the financial asset index of China from 2010 to 2018. Employing CRE regressions, Heckman two-stage models and PSM methods, we find that undertaking entrepreneurship helps to increase the efficiency of household portfolios significantly. This study also verifies that entrepreneurial households improve their portfolio efficiency through financial information by testing the moderating effects of social network, business experience and financial literacy. In addition, this study shows that entrepreneurial households generally adopt a less diversified strategy in asset allocation than do non-entrepreneurial households. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Studies on small firm growth in many countries focused on some specific factors, and no comprehensive research on this issue is avail-able to draw the conclusion. Based on the concept of the theory of Resource Based View (RBV), a research framework is formulated in order to examine how resources like finance and financial literacy of the owner-manager affect financial and non-financial growth of small firms operating in Bangladesh. Data was collected through self-administered questionnaires from 407 owner-managers of small firms operating in three divisions of Bangladesh where most of the small businesses are concentrated. Using partial least squares analysis, the paper found that both finance and financial literacy have positive and statistically significant relation with small firm financial and non-financial growth. The paper also showed that private organizations support moderates the relationships between finance, financial literacy and small firm financial and non-financial growth. From the findings, it is evident that if small firms have better access to financial resources and can earn required financial literacy and at the same time get proper and adequate support from private orga-nizations, they will contribute more to the economy by achieving their financial and non-financial growth. © 2020 Small Business Institute®.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify and explore the role of Islamic financing in supporting development of halal industry in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: This research is divided into two studies. The first study uses survey-based quantitative method and the second study uses focus group discussion (FGD) method. Using a purposive and proportional sampling technique in the first study, this research collected 1,985 samples of Islamic financial products of business owners (demand-side) from all parts of Indonesia. The data were analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modeling approach. The authors also conducted FGDs, involving 35 participants from government, financial, social and education institutions (supply-side) as well as business owners (demand-side) in three separated times. Findings: In the first study, it can be identified that literacy on Islamic finance, attitude and awareness strongly affect business owners’ intention to use Islamic financial products. It is also found that subjective norm significantly influences literacy, attitude and awareness. Interestingly, religiosity does not significantly affect attitude toward Islamic financial products. According to the FGD in the second study, this research generates several factors motivating business owners’ preference to choose conventional rather than Islamic financial products, including expensive pricing, less developed technology, bad service quality and the halal status of the products. The reason for insignificant results of religiosity on attitude in the first study is explained in the second study. Most users are utilitarians who mainly perceived the products based on the sought benefits provided by the products. Practical implications: This research offers the government a road map showing the strategy to build Islamic financial ecosystem in Indonesia. The road map integrates supply-side, which includes government, financial industries, social and education institutions and scientific organizations, and demand-side, which includes business owners or entrepreneur associations. Originality/value: This research provides a wide range of samples derived from business owners’ respondents of halal industry in all representative islands in Indonesia. Therefore, it gives more holistic and representative findings. In addition, the analysis in this research covers not only the demand-side but also the supply-side perspective. Lastly, this research provides an Islamic financial ecosystem model that integrates all stakeholders to improve halal industry performance as a whole. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study analyzes SMEs’ performance problems in the trade sector in Pekanbaru by using several internal company factors to build a competitive strategy till the year 2021. The variables used in this study consisted of social capital, financial literacy, financial inclusion, and business performance. The study used 300 SMEs consisting of 26 wholesalers and 274 retailers in Pekanbaru, Riau. We used a structural equation model (SEM) approach with AMOS for hypothesis testing. The results show that social capital and financial literacy have a significant direct effect on the SME businesses’ performance in the trade sector in Pekanbaru. This shows that social capital and financial literacy are two determining factors for the success of SME businesses. However, social capital does not affect business performance indirectly through the role of financial inclusion. © 2021 Institute of Society Transformation. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Philippine microenterprises sector is considered as an important stimulus of the country’s economic growth. Previous studies have cited that the struggles faced by micro and small entrepreneurs are brought about by the difficulty in access to finance and the lack of entrepreneurs’ financial literacy and inadequate business acumen. Anchored on the resource-based view theory, the primary objective of this study is to determine the role of financial sophistication, as a human capital resource, and its components, on the link between the strategy–sustainability indicator relationship. Based on a study of 384 micro-entrepreneurs from the National Capital Region, results of the partial least squares–structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) showed that business strategy is positively linked to each of the sustainability indicators, that is, economic, environmental, social, and governance. Conversely, the entrepreneur’s financial sophistication increases the effect of business strategy on each of the sustainability indicators. The results of the study also showed that a positive financial behavior and decision-making style are significant components of financial sophistication. © 2020, Asia-Pacific Social Science Review.

AB  - Firms need sufficient resources (tangible and intangible) and capabilities to build unique products due to customers' demands and choices, market competition and globalization. Despite sufficient resources, many firms cannot build new products according to the customers' preferences and market trends due to lack of marketing capabilities, lack of skilled marketing staff and lack of experienced managers. However, studies have not yet examined what types of intangible skills of marketing managers are prominent for building new products. This study examines the importance of the intangible skills; intellectual captial, financial literacy and business experience in new product development that results in sustainable competitive performance. We used a mixed-method approach; questionnaire (283) and interviews (16) for data collection and then applied structural equation modelling for testing the hypotheses. The results revealed that all the three intangible skills; intellectual captial, financial literacy and business experience significant influence new product development and sustainable competitive performance. However, considering the relative importance, financial literacy and intellectual capital are the most significant predictors of sustainable competitive performance and new product development respectively. Moreover, new product development fully mediates the path between intellectual capital and sustainable competitive performance while it partially mediates the link between financial literacy, business experience and sustainable competitive performance. Considering the importance of tangible resources, our study scrutinized that financial resources have a significant influence on new product development and sustainable competitive performance while technological resources do not play a significant role. This research recommends firms to emphasize on the improvement of intangible skills of the managers in order to build new products that result in sustainable competitive position. This study also recommends marketing managers to improve their financial skills and experience by participating in various seminars and workshops that can spur their new idea generation and new product development capabilities. © 2020 Ali et al.

AB  - Financial literacy empowers consumers to make more informed financial decisions, including investing in mutual funds. In this study, the sociodemographic profile of working adults with low investment literacy vis-à-vis high investment literacy are examined first. Next, the impact of investment literacy and risk tolerance on the likelihood of investing in mutual funds are explored. Among a sample of 260 working adults comprising mainly of Masters of Business Administration (MBA) students from a leading public higher institution in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the study shows that those with Business/Economics education backgrounds have the highest investment literacy and are more likely to invest in mutual funds compared to individuals from the Arts and other miscellaneous backgrounds. Although Muslims are the least literate in investment matters, they are more likely to hold mutual fund investments relative to those who profess Christianity and Hinduism. Individuals with relatively high income and occupational levels have relatively higher investment literacy. Risk tolerance does not influence the likelihood of investing in mutual fund investments. Policymakers should focus on females, those with Arts education background, Muslims, and those from the lower income/employment ranks to increase their investment literacy through financial education workshops. Mutual fund companies may consider embarking an aggressive knowledge sharing videos related to mutual funds via non-mainstream media such as social media to increase the penetration of mutual fund investments, among the untapped markets. © 2020, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

AB  - Background and aim: Financial literacy (or financial competence) has become an internationally relevant and highly regarded topic. Since people often lack sufficient financial competence, in many countries efforts have been made to foster formal financial education. Less attention, however, has been paid to whether informal learning using information available on the Internet can also support the development of financial competence. However, this seems to be an important question because the Internet has expanded the opportunities for informal learning. In addition, people need to acquire financial competence on their own because not every financial topic relevant in one’s lifetime is covered in formal education syllabi. Against this background, in this study we tested whether people are able to develop financial competence by learning informally using information available on the Internet. We focused on mortgage loans, as they are comparatively complex financial products. Mortgage loans have the potential to significantly influence an individual’s financial situation. In addition, society might carry the burdens of risky and uninformed decisions about mortgage loans—as the financial and real estate crisis has shown. Method: 45 students of economics and business studies in their final undergraduate year participated. They were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental group explored information about mortgage loans using the loan calculator of a German bank. The control group did not explore webpages. Before the intervention, students from both groups completed knowledge tests and self-assessed their financial knowledge and behaviour. After the intervention, students had to work on a case and to decide whether a small family should take out a mortgage loan for financing a house. The decision had to be justified. In addition, students were administered an immediate and delayed knowledge test. Results and conclusions: Students of both groups did not differ in knowledge acquisition, decision making about taking a mortgage loan and argumentation quality. However, prior knowledge can be referred to in order to explain the results. Therefore, informal learning using the Internet did not seem to be effective if people did not have sufficient prior knowledge. This result underlines, on the one hand, the necessity of financial education—be it prior to informal learning or in the course of informal learning. On the other hand, the results can be interpreted as a hint to consider how to improve informal learning activities, e.g. by supporting self-regulation or by improving information material. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - In the industry 4.0 model, innovation and technology are adopted to revolutionize business models with a particular focus on repeatable and scalable business models. This study investigates the opportunities and challenges of FinTech startup firms using Thailand as a case study. A mixed-method approach is adopted using secondary data accessed from Thailand FinTech associations and primary data collected from in-depth interviews. Descriptive analysis and content analysis were used to achieve robust results. The empirical results show a snapshot of FinTech firms in Thailand, and how they generate both opportunities and challenges for development and growth. Findings indicate that these opportunities and challenges occur as a result of the national technology system and financial regulations, symbiotic relationships, and the inter-relationship through digital literacy, financial literacy, and financial inclusion. The study discusses each factor in detail and proposes suggestions for further studies. The findings could be used by policy makers and local authorities to make improvements, as well as minimize the potential risks for FinTech startup firms and contribute to sustainability in the economy as a whole. © 2021.

AB  - Vulnerable consumers are at particular risk of financial detriment due to, for example, low financial literacy or numeracy, high debt, low income, or impactful changes in personal circumstances. We introduce a comprehensive and formative measure of financial vulnerability that integrates these risk factors and is grounded in definitions of vulnerability from financial regulation bodies and government agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Across three studies of US individuals, we assess the nomological validity of this measure of financial vulnerability through its relationship with positive and negative financial outcomes (e.g., savings levels, paying credit card balances in full each month, being in arrears) as well as relevant psychological characteristics (e.g., personal savings orientation [PSO], money management skills, financial self-efficacy). Moreover, we examine whether and how these psychological characteristics mediate the relationship between financial vulnerability and financial outcomes. We conclude with an overview of implications for policy makers and business practitioners. Copyright 2018 by The American Council on Consumer Interests

AB  - Purpose: The main purpose of this research is to present alternative solutions in this field by revealing the income and debt status of farmers with livestock income. Desgn/Methodology/Approach: The main material of the research is the survey study conducted with the producers in the research area. Apart from the survey data, the data of the Business Registration System (CKS), which is registered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, were used because it is both an official registration in the field of plant production and accepted in the banking system. The records of the producers surveyed from the data of the National Milk Registration System were determined and included in the data set. Results were evaluated with descriptive statistics and Likert scale. Fndngs: It is seen that farmers with low income level turn to dairy farming to increase their income. On the other hand, it has been determined that borrowing has increased in these enterprises and they are increasingly in loan relationship with banks. Orgnalty/Value: Short-term loan products should be offered to businesses dealing with dairy farming. It is a necessity for farmers with low income or few animals to market their products through cooperatives. In addition, improving the financial literacy level of farmers is necessary for the healthy use of finance © 2021, Turkish Journal of Agricultural Economics. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Financial education has become an essential component of the economic balance for families, and much is being discussed about the methods, which raise the levels of financial education of the population. Thus, the overall objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of formal and business education on the level of financial education. Design/methodology/approach: This research is characterized as a quasi-experimental study, with undergraduate students. As a data collection technique, a structured questionnaire was used. Findings: The results confirm the importance of formal and business education, as well as gender, for the financial education of individuals. More specifically, being male and having contact with a greater number of financial disciplines increase the level of financial education of the individual. Originality/value: This article demonstrated that the trajectory of the knowledge traversed by individuals within the same level of schooling is of paramount importance. The results show that formal and business education can improve the levels of financial education and reinforce the relevance of strategic actions in this area. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study examines the attitudes of university students towards stock market investment and investigates the factors that influence their willingness to invest in stocks. A survey-based method of research was adopted and data was collected from 473 students from the University of Ghana Business School by means of a questionnaire. The partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique was used to analyse the data. The results demonstrate that two dimensions of the money attitude construct: obsession and viewing of money as a good thing are important predictors of an individual's willingness to invest in stocks. The results also show that financial literacy, ethical stance towards stock market investment and financial risk attitude of an individual have important implications on willingness to invest in stocks. Given that stock market participation at the individual level is low in most countries, an understanding of the factors that influence individuals' decision to invest in stocks may be useful in developing the appropriate strategies to encourage people to invest in stocks. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This study analyzes the factors influencing financial inclusion and financial resilience in Africa. Using national surveys of 40 African countries and the doing business database, multiple models are performed to analyze financial inclusion drivers. The results show that individual characteristics, barriers to formal accounting, financial literacy and innovation condition the decision to have a traditional or mobile account. Informal savings are common among women, youth and in rural areas while formal savings predominate among men, the elderly and in urban areas. A high level of education and income leads people to migrate to formal savings. For business purposes, informal savings are preferred while for old age, individuals resort to formal savings because of interest rates. Social lifestyles make informal credit predominate in Africa. However, when people have employment, high income or education, they turn more to formal credit to preserve their reputation because of the respect and popularity they enjoy in their community. Marriage, financial literacy and innovation improve the resilience of individuals, while employment increases their vulnerability. Key policy recommendations are to improve the banking sector, institutions, innovations and income-generating activities to attract women and reduce the gender gap. © 2022 African Development Bank.

AB  - The financial and public health crises that have impacted the global economy in the past two decades have heightened awareness of the importance of financial literacy for consumers, businesses, and governments. This study uses secondary school teacher and student pretest and posttest scores on the Test of Financial Literacy to identify persistence and changes in learning for teachers and students by content standard. Using non-random data collected as part of Mississippi's Master Teacher of Personal Finance standards-based teacher training program, results show that teacher participants know a lot about personal finance prior to the training and learn more during the training while their students do not know very much about personal finance prior to starting a class that includes this content and know a little more when they finish the class. Disaggregating teacher and student results shows that teacher knowledge about financial investing is relatively low, and student learning in investing, saving, and insuring is also low. The study highlights the need for implementation guidelines for teachers and required assessment for students. Specifically, the guidelines and assessment could be used to reallocate scarce resources more effectively to teach these content areas where deficiencies are identified. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study aims to determine the effect of financial literacy and taxation on competitive advantage, in order to determine the effect of financial literacy and taxation on the performance of MSMEs, and to determine the effect of competitive advantage on the performance of MSMEs. This study uses primary data through a questionnaire. The population is Creative MSME actors in DIY. Creative MSMEs in Yogyakarta were chosen because Yogyakarta is an area that is rich in traditional culture and various characters of its inhabitants, thus encouraging the development of the potential of Creative MSMEs. This research uses primary data sources on Creative MSMEs in Yogyakarta. The samples were determined by the proportional simple random sampling technique; taking a sample of 20% of the total Creative MSMEs in each district/city. The samples that deserve to be respondents in this study were 210 samples of Creative MSMEs actors in DIY. The statistical technique for analyzing data is the AMOS Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The results showed that financial literacy had an effect on the competitive advantage and performance of MSMEs, tax literacy had an effect on competitive advantage, competitive advantage had an effect on the performance of MSMEs. However, tax literacy has no effect on the performance of MSMEs. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper investigates the viability of the relationship-oriented business model. Specifically, it examines the effects of bank customers' satisfaction, loyalty, and trust in bank advisors on two client-level performance measures; client-level non-interest revenue, and client-level revenue on net interest spread. It further investigates how effects are moderated by differences in clients' risk tolerance and financial literacy. Design/methodology/approach: The findings are based on analyses of a data set that combines survey data (collected from 13,525 bank clients in 2013) with bank record data from each respondent. The cross sectional data is analyzed using OLS-regression and structural equation modeling. Findings: Overall, the findings are that the relationship banking model generates non-interest revenue, but not revenue on net interest spread. In more detail, findings show that trust has a positive direct effect on client-level non-interest revenue. Furthermore, trust mediates the entire effect of satisfaction and loyalty on client-level non-interest revenue. Customer satisfaction and loyalty do not lead to enhanced client-level non-interest revenue if there is little trust in bank advisors. Findings further show that the relevance of trust for non-interest revenue is higher for clients with high risk tolerance and high financial literacy. Satisfaction, loyalty, and trust have no effect, however, on client-level revenue on net interest spread. Originality/value: While previous literature mainly has used subjective intentions (e.g., repurchase behavior) as operationalization of performance, this paper combines subjective survey data and objective performance data, allowing the investigation of how the customer relationship model affects actual performance. Furthermore, the paper investigates the relational banking model's effect on non-interest and net interest spread revenue, and we show that the relational banking model generates only non-interest revenue, and not net interest spread revenue. The fine-grained client-level data also allows the investigation on how the effect of trust on client-level performance differs among client groups with different cognitive characteristics (i.e., risk tolerance and financial literacy). © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the economic growth of Indonesia. Government regulations to limit large-scale social activities has caused marketing and financial difficulties for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Digital and financial literacy have the potential to overcome the problems. This study attempts to identify the determinants of MSME sustainability during the pandemic. By using a questionnaire, this study collected 204 data from MSMEs for further analyses. MSME sustainability is influenced by the digital and financial literacy of MSME owners and is a cause for concern. The implementation of health and safety measures (HSM) has an insignificant impact on business sustainability, but HSM affects financial and digital literacy. Entrepreneurial skills are important to improve HSM and owners’ digital and financial literacy. The government and other parties need to provide more soft loans and facilitate MSMEs to develop entrepreneurial skills, digital and financial literacy to improve business sustainability during the pandemic. © 2022 AESS Publications.

AB  - In 2018, the news industry found itself in the headlines when it revealed the significant difference in levels of pay between the genders, with some pre-eminent financial publications having the widest pay gaps. This provided a timely opportunity to survey 65 economic, financial, and business journalists–both men and women–working for news outlets in the UK, including the BBC and the Financial Times. The survey explored the values and working practices of business, economic and financial journalists in the UK, as well as their opinions about the gender pay gap. Results show that while women, as expected, are paid less than the men and hold fewer positions of seniority, few expressed opinions about the gender pay gap. Engaging a wide audience and a lack of resources in the industry to be able to do so are the most pressing concerns for the journalists surveyed. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study aims to map the potential sectors based on the financial and digital literacy of women entrepreneurs in the city of Palembang, Indonesia, which continues from the previous research by Fauzi, Antoni, and Suwarni (2020). The research sample is small and medium businesses owned and managed by women entrepreneurs in Palembang where there are 18 districts. The research sample is selected from 18 districts in the city of Palembang and the total sample used is 115 women entrepreneur respondents. Descriptive statistics is employed in this study to map potential sectors and the results show that most businesses in Palembang are businesses engaged in the food, beverage, and tobacco industry, which account for 44.9%, while businesses engaged in other processing sectors rank second among the micro and small businesses in Palembang. Local and provincial governments can be more responsive to stimulate the food, beverage, and tobacco industry sector, other processing industry sectors and the wood industry sector, and wood furniture products so that products in the industrial sector can be superior in the future. The provision of coaching and training must also be more intensively provided by the relevant agencies so that they can help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to develop in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose – This paper suggests that the human element is key when it comes to investors’ trust in financial markets. Ignoring it may jeopardise the effectiveness of the recent regulatory growth. The study takes a demand-based perspective, assuming the relationship between financial advisors and investors is based upon trust, and it analyses the conditions that may lead to the existence (or not) of trust. Design/methodology/approach – Using a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of data collected from 366 questionnaires, we are able to test, in a qualitative non-parametric way, the conditional arguments that may lead investors to trust (or not) their financial advisor. Findings – The results show that trust conditions differ, depending on the degree of investors’ participation in financial markets. The way investors with a basic relationship with financial markets perceive the behaviour of their financial advisors is key in establishing (or not) their trust. For investors with a more advanced relationship with the market, trust (or its absence) also depends on investors’ characteristics. In particular, their financial literacy plays a more-than-negligible role. The joint analysis of the conditions leading to trust and its absence highlights the robustness of our findings. Originality/value – By understanding the conditions that establish trust, financial institutions can design strategies to strengthen the level of investors’ confidence in their services, improving the relationship between market players, and increasing business. From the supervisory authorities’ point of view, the approval of a code of conduct for financial advisors, taking into account our results, can help improve the overall trust in financial markets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply Butler’s (1991) psychometric scale and the fsQCA methodology to study investors’ trust in financial advisors. © FECAP.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to fill the gap in previous research that focuses on the superficial aspects of equity crowdfunding (ECF) campaigns and financial practices by examining financial literacy aspects, such as due diligence and valuation, in terms of factors that influence Japanese individual investors' investments in ECF. Design/methodology/approach: The status of information disclosure in ECF campaigns is checked. In addition, the feasibility of the initial due diligence and valuation using this information is verified. Specifically, the lack of financial literacy hypothesis is developed and (1) expected market capitalization in the final fiscal year of the business plan and (2) expected returns on investment (IRR: internal rate of return) are estimated. Findings: ECF campaigns in Japan disclose information equivalent to that obtained by professional venture capitalists. Analysis of the disclosed business plan allows for initial due diligence and valuation. By contrast, due diligence reveals that some projects are unlikely to be listed even if their business plans are met, and others have low IRRs. In addition, a stock acquisition rights project, in which even professional investors are unable to calculate IRRs, is completed at the same rate as a common stock project; this suggests that individual investors lack financial literacy. Originality/value: Analyzing ECF from financial literacy aspects, such as due diligence and valuation, is unique. Such aspects are essential for private equity investments but have not been addressed in previous studies. © 2021, Masatoshi Fujii, Chie Hosomi and Yoshiaki Nose.

AB  - In modern economic conditions, marketing plays an important role in the activities of any company, regardless of the objectives of the activity, the functional specifics and the basis of financing. Marketing is widely used by commercial companies as a tool for shaping the image, corporate identity of the company, as well as a way to attract customers and stimulate sales channels. Marketing as a way to improve the efficiency of non-profit companies and as a mechanism for attracting financial resources within the legal framework of their activities, unfortunately, is now applicable but is limited. The main reason for the non-use of marketing concepts by non-profit entities is the low level of financial literacy of the subjects of the non-profit sector, reliance on the state as the main "financial distributor" of resources and the inability of non-profit organizations to exist autonomously or independently, while implementing their strategic and operational goals more efficiently and effectively. As practice shows in Russia, more than 80% of non-profit organizations depend on government funding, and only 20% are able to earn their own resources in parallel, which do not contradict the main concept of their existence. An important role in this matter is played by the study of the methodological basis and experience of using marketing in the activities of NGOs on the example of market economy countries. Among the main marketing concepts, applicable NPOs in developed and developing countries are the use of marketing mix tools, targeting the target product, determining the social effect, symbiosis of the methodological foundations of the functioning of commercial and non-commercial economic development blocks, network marketing. The use of marketing concepts in the activities of non-profit organizations contributes to the improvement of qualitative and quantitative indicators of active non-profit business entities, more rational use of the resource base and the achievement of a common development strategy as part of a common strategy for creating such structural units. © 2020 AJHTL /Author/s.

AB  - The uncertainty of income earned by farmers, namely crop failure with a very high risk, will cause financial problems in their families. The target or respondents of this study are farmers who live in Lahat Regency, South Sumatera. Initial findings indicate that the level of financial inclusion of farmers in the Lahat Regency is still quite low. The purpose of this study is to analyze the level of farmers' financial literacy, identify the components of farmers' financial literacy, and analyze the factors that affect the level of farmers' financial literacy. The research method applied is descriptive analysis and multiple regression. The analysis showed that most of the literate farmers were in the moderately literate category of 47.2 percent and the least of the farmers in the less literate category was 24.5 percent. The financial attitude component gave the largest contribution to the farmers' financial literacy index, which was 0.73. Besides, the factor affecting the level of financial literacy of farmers is education. The policy implication resulting from this research is the existence of a structured promotion and training of financial literacy for farmers by local governments. In addition, campaigning for the importance of being educated and inviting educated people to start running agricultural business activities. © 2021 Ascociacion Internacional de Economia Aplicada.

AB  - Financial citizenship is crucial in our modern world. Financial citizenship is underpinned by the education of future generations so that they can understand both their local and global economies to make the best financial decisions concerning their lives. This paper discusses financial literacy, how it relates to individual citizens, and how it correlates with social, political and business spheres. According to current financial capability models, every individual’s financial well-being can be boosted by developing their financial knowledge and competency, which will improve their motivations and confidence. Societal constructs significantly create financial socialization, which increases our accessibility and engagements with institutions, businesses, political systems and society as a whole. Being educated about the details required for financial literacy is every human being’s right. Citizens have been characterized as being personally responsible, participatory or justice oriented; each person’s specific perspective can impact their financial lives, which supports the importance of the current concept of financial citizenship. Boosting global education about economic citizenship will help to reduce poverty, create more sustainable economic environments, and improve social outcomes and the life satisfaction of the world population. These concepts will be explored and discussed in this paper. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore and examine the role of accounting and accountants in customary land transactions between Indigenous peoples and foreign corporate entities. The paper uses the case of two accountants who utilised accounting technologies in lease agreements to alienate customary land from Indigenous landowners in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Design/methodology/approach: Employing a case study methodology, the paper draws on contemporary data sets of transcripts related to a Commission of Inquiry established in 2011 to investigate PNG’s Special Agricultural Business Lease system. Analysis of other publicly available data and semi-structured interviews with PNG landowners and other stakeholders supplement and triangulate data from the inquiry transcripts. A Bourdieusian lens was adopted to conceptualise how accounting was used in the struggles for customary land between foreign developers and Indigenous landowners within the wider capitalist field and the traditional Melanesian field. Findings: This paper reveals how accountants exploited PNG’s customary land registration system, the Indigenous peoples’ lack of financial literacy and their desperation for development to alienate customary land from landowners. The accountants employed accounting technologies in the sublease agreements to reduce their royalty obligations to the landowners and to impose penalty clauses that made it financially impossible for the landowners to cancel the leases. The accountants used accounting to normalise, legitimise and rationalise these exploitative arrangements in formal lease contracts. Originality/value: This paper responds to the call for research on accounting and Indigenous peoples that is contemporary rather than historic; examines the role of accountants in Indigenous relations, and examines the emancipatory potential of accounting. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to examine the relationship between artistic orientation and entrepreneurial performance and how other central entrepreneurial resources, namely, entrepreneurial orientation and financial literacy, affect this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Regulatory focus theory was used to develop the model. A survey of 375 small creative business entrepreneurs was conducted in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and a hierarchical linear regression was used for data analysis. Findings: The results reveal a positive correlation between artistic orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, financial literacy and entrepreneurial performance. Therefore, artistic orientation affects a creative firm’s financial and nonfinancial performance. In addition, artistic orientation and financial literacy provide a positive influence on the overall performance of a creative venture. However, the interaction effect of entrepreneurial orientation and financial literacy on the artistic orientation – performance relationship – is invisible Practical implications: This research provides guidance on how creative firms may focus on the acquisition, development and protection of useful resources, namely, artistic orientation and financial literacy Originality/value: This research is the first systematic empirical test evaluating the relationship between artistic orientation and entrepreneurial performance. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - High educational debt is prevalent among resident physicians and correlates with adverse well-being outcomes, including symptoms of stress and burnout. Residents also report low financial literacy levels, affecting financial well-being. Understanding resident viewpoints toward financial well-being initiatives is crucial to develop targeted resident financial well-being programs. This study aims to examine residents’ experiences financing their medical education and how these experiences influence well-being and attitudes toward financial education in residency. We recruited residents from a Southern California health system with residency programs in Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery, and Psychiatry. We contacted residents by email and text message to participate in semi-structured interviews. We conducted interviews from October 2020 to March 2021 and analyzed 59 resident interviews using reflexive thematic analysis. Among residents, 76% (45/59) had ≥ $200,000 in student loans. Residents perceived mounting medical education debt as unfairly burdensome for trainees engaged in socially beneficial work, leaving residents feeling undervalued–a feeling heightened by the stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic–and hampering well-being. Compartmentalizing debt attenuated financial stressors but often made financial education seem less pressing. A subset of residents described how financial planning restored some agency and enhanced well-being, noting that protected didactic time for financial education was crucial. Resident interviews provide practical guidance regarding designing financial education sessions. Desired education included managing debt, retirement planning, and the business of medicine. How residents framed educational debt and their degree of financial literacy impacted their well-being and sense of agency. Residents proposed that residency programs can aid in stress mitigation by providing residents with skills to help manage debt and plan for retirement. To reduce clinician indebtedness, this approach needs to occur in tandem with systemic changes to financing medical education. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Estimation of the causal effect of a binary treatment on outcomes often requires conditioning on covariates to address selection concerning observed variables. This is not straightforward when one or more of the covariates are measured with error. Here, we present a new semi-parametric estimator that addresses this issue. In particular, we focus on inverse propensity score weighting estimators when the propensity score is of an unknown functional form and some covariates are subject to classical measurement error. Our proposed solution involves deconvolution kernel estimators of the propensity score and the regression function weighted by a deconvolution kernel density estimator. Simulations and replication of a study examining the impact of two financial literacy interventions on the business practices of entrepreneurs show our estimator to be valuable to empirical researchers. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - This study aimed to discover the comprehension of business actors of Small Medium Enterprises (SME) in creative industry sector on the concept of sharia finance as well as formulating the development strategy of financial literacy toward business actors of creative industries. This study used a qualitative approach of case study in Yogyakarta Special Region, Indonesia. The types of data used are primary and secondary data. The data analysis was performed through a descriptive-statistical analysis, and the policy formulation was done through SWOT analysis. This study found that the index of sharia financial literacy on the majority of SMEs in the creative industry sector is in the medium category (sufficient literate). The improvement strategies for financial literacy are performed through a) the strategy of collaboration between stakeholders (penta-helix); b) the establishment of education centers and the socialization of sharia finance at regional level; c) sharia-based bank and non-bank financial institutions should be more aggressive in providing financial services to SMEs. © 2019, IJSTR.

AB  - The article analyzes the cooperation with foreign countries in the field of education since the early days of independence through the use of scientific literatures. As a result of this relationship, it was also possible to establish promising programs with a number of foreign countries, and as a result of these contacts the educational institutions were able to study in developed countries. According to the order of the Ministry of Public Education of the Republic of Uzbekistan August 20, 2008 “About the organization of trips of professors and teachers abroad” within the “Education Sector Development Program”, 18 teachers from Ferghana region were on a business trip in Germany. The study identifies and implements monitoring of students’ quality of knowledge in 5 areas: reading literacy, mathematical literacy, financial literacy, computer literacy, and scientific literacy. Assessment is carried out once every 3 years and is supervised by the Australian Council of Pedagogical Research (ACER), the Netherlands National Institute for Pedagogical Measurements (CITO), the US Institute for Educational Testing (ETS), and the National Institute for Educational Research (NIER). In 2009, 74 countries participated in this study, and in 2012, students from 65 countries were assessed for the first time, with interactive tasks (inretactive problems) as a new type of control tasks, and students were asked to explore a new object-a virtual machine. To achieve this goal, MP3 players and air conditioning are provided as virtual machines. © IJSTR 2020.

AB  - Access to finance through financial institutions is highly dependent on financial literacy. The basic purpose of this paper is to examine the women’s financial literacy level in Pakistan, especially, among women entrepreneurs. This study also tries to determine the effect of the financial literacy of women entrepreneurs on their access to finance and subsequent financial decision-making about their businesses. Current research conducted in this study used semi-structured questionnaires, selected interviews, and focus groups. Findings show that women entrepreneurs lack proper knowledge of financial terminologies, mechanisms of financial access, and government initiatives for women entrepreneurs. It is suggested in the light of these findings, that all the relevant stakeholders should work together to enhance financial literacy among current and prospective women entrepreneurs of Pakistan. Strengthening women's entrepreneurship may play a significant role to alleviate poverty among the female population of the country. © University of Tehran.

AB  - This article investigates the causes of the “high-fee puzzle,” which is that some people pay high-fees for financial advice and financial products when lower-fee advice and products are available. We hypothesize that lack of awareness of the size of the effect of fees on account balances is one cause. We survey college students with business-related majors, asking them questions on the effects of fees on account balances, as well as standard financial literacy questions. We find that only one-third of students are able to answer the fee questions correctly; three-quarters correctly answered the common financial literacy questions. We tested whether people understand the importance of fees when fees are presented in a simple, transparent manner. Our results suggest that policies to require simple, transparent fee disclosures may be more effective if more people understood the importance of fees. For pension participants, our results suggest the importance of investment menus excluding high-fee options and focusing on low-fee options. © 2020 Pageant Media Ltd.

AB  - Extensive empirical evidence shows that women perform worse in financial literacy tests, which implies that their financial behaviour may also be worse compared to men. However, the literature on the gender gap in financial behaviour is scanty and highly inconclusive. Using data from a survey of married and cohabiting couples living in Poland (N=1,000) and a multi-dimensional scale validated in terms of its psychometric properties, this article compares the financial behaviour of women and men. The applied tests did not show any significant gender differences in the overall financial behaviour index or in any of the subdomains of the behaviour distinguished in the applied scale. Using the social identity theory as a framework, we discuss possible explanations of these puzzling findings, which may imply that women are unnecessarily considered a disadvantaged group in terms of preparedness to participate in financial life, including the business sphere. Implications for Central European audience: Assuming that the gender differences in financial literacy and behaviour can be explained on the grounds of the social identity theory, Central and Eastern Europe may differ from Western Europe in terms of the gender gap. Socially-imposed gender roles were presumably shaped differently behind the Iron Curtain, which resulted in that the distinction between masculine and feminine roles got blurred under the Soviet regime. As a result, the absence of gender differences in financial behaviour is more likely to occur in Central and Eastern European countries. Financial education initiatives should take this circumstance into account. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Research on entrepreneurship education (EE) emphasizes the role of learning environments, contexts and pedagogical choices in developing students’ entrepreneurial competences. EE has assumed that it solely carries the task of improving entrepreneurial competences. Yet, the objectives, content and methods of teaching vary, and hence non-entrepreneurship teachers’ classrooms can also provide a learning environment for entrepreneurial competences. However, whether or not this kind of unintentional teaching of entrepreneurial competences takes place has not been widely addressed. In this study, the authors investigate how business school non-entrepreneurship teachers’ teaching methods unintentionally match the known framework of entrepreneurial competences. The findings indicate that non-entrepreneurship teachers do unintentionally expose their students to entrepreneurial competences such as creativity, learning from experience and financial literacy. However, competences such as opportunity recognition, perseverance and mobilizing resources do not receive similar attention. The findings indicate that some entrepreneurial competences are not solely owned by EE, but can be embedded in non-entrepreneurship education. Accordingly, the study extends the current understanding of EE and which “niche” competences should be emphasized in it, but also demonstrates how non-entrepreneurship teachers can expose students to entrepreneurial competences while teaching in their own subject areas. © The Author(s) 2021.

We use gender, age, parental income, pocket money, and place of residence as the proxies of demographic characteristics. In addition, financial attitude, and financial behavior are considered as proxies of personality characteristics. The population of this research is the students of business/management department of Universitas Negeri Jakarta. We use 194 students as the sample which represents twenty percent of population. The result of this study shows that the level of financial literacy of the students is in middle category. We use logistic regression as the statistical tool and also found that several proxies like age, pocket money, and financial behavior had positive effects toward the level of student's financial literacy. However, other proxies like residence and financial attitude had a negative sign on financial literacy. While gender and parental income had no significant effect on financial literacy. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

AB  - With the rapid social and economic development, the entrepreneurship skills become more important for the youth to ensure positive development of youth leadership skills. The purpose of this study is to investigate the entrepreneurship skills of urban youth and then develop a model for youth entrepreneurship skills of the community-based leadership training for the urban youth in China. In this study, two methods have been applied: students’ questionnaire survey and the Fuzzy Delphi Method by experts. This study involved 526 students aged 14 to 18 years old in four secondary schools and high schools in Baoding city, Shijiazhuang city, Chengde city and Handan city in Hebei Province for survey. The findings from the survey show that the levels of entrepreneurship skills are still at moderate level. The Fuzzy Delphi Method was conducted to eighteen experts from the fields of education, language, Chinese Studies, accounting and business, and life sciences to get a consensus on youth entrepreneurship skills and related activities. The results demonstrate that there are three categories of skills for the entrepreneurship namely, visiting the local famous enterprises; the lecture activities of successful entrepreneur to share their experiences to make the youth start to learn entrepreneurship; and the activities of financial literacy and personal finance. © 2019, University of Malaya.

AB  - The poor performance of female entrepreneurs, exemplified in their inability to realize their full potential and compete fairly with their male counterparts owing to financial illiteracy, motivated this study. Therefore, this study examined the effect of financial literacy on business performance among female micro-entrepreneurs. Using the survey research design, data were collected from 247 female entrepreneurs from six states in the North-Eastern region of Nigeria. The hypotheses developed for the study were tested using path modeling-structural equation modeling with the aid of SmartPLS software version 3.2.7. The result revealed that all proxies of financial literacy (financial education, cash forecasting, and bookkeeping have significant effects on business performance of female entrepreneurs. Additionally, the paper revealed that financial education contributed more to the variance in business performance of the female micro- entrepreneurs, this was followed by bookkeeping practices, while cash-forecasting has the least effect on the variance in business performance. This implies that financial education is essential for the success of female micro-entrepreneurs. Thus, this study advocates the need for continuing trainings and workshops for female microentrepreneurs on financial concepts such as bookkeeping, cash forecasting, and market volatilities. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

AB  - This paper primarily aims to assess the impact of financial literacy on households’ investment choices. The paper employs secondary data from the FinScope survey (2017) conducted by Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSDT). In particular, the study aims at establishing whether the choices of investment platforms are influenced by the financial literacy level of the heads of households. To do so, the study employed both bivariate and multivariate analytical techniques. The study finds that financial literacy is positively and significantly associated with household investment choices. More specifically, as households become more financially literate, they divert from investing in informal groups towards more formal investment platforms such as investment accounts, agricultural ventures as well as personal business. Such observations may be partly attributable to the facts that individuals whose financial literacy is sound enough are more likely to be equipped with skills and knowledge of risks associated with investment opportunities and some other several financial products. The study also reveals that financial literacy is significantly associated with households’ socio-demographic factors, and that the adult population exhibits a large financial literacy gap and, therefore, adults should not be considered as a homogenous group—instead, gender, age, education and income levels of the households, which are showcased in this study, should also be taken into consideration. The study opines that, because most of households, as revealed in the survey from which the employed dataset is based, are hailing from rural settings where agriculture is the main economic activity, we establish that agricultural ventures require a complete revamp for Tanzania to become a middle-income economy through its industrialization agenda. The study also proposes the financial literacy programmes to be rolled on to students from early stage of their education such as secondary schools. © 2020, MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

AB  - Purpose: Sustainable development has now been recognised as the pivot around which development activities should revolve. Banking is an important component in the same and adoption of sustainable banking practices by various banking institutions is a strong driver to achieve sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to study the level of adoption of sustainable banking tools and the extent to which banking institutions practice the same in India. In addition, the banking institutions have been ranked and categorised on basis of their sustainable banking performance. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed framework focuses on the environmental and social conduct of the banks, who address the issues of sustainability in Indian banking sector. As there is a difference in the economic standards of developed and developing countries, the review of literature helps to figure out the gap in specific frameworks for assessing sustainable banking practices in developing countries. Previous researchers have made an attempt to develop a general framework for assessing the sustainable banking efforts of the banking sector. These studies fall short of indicators on the social dimension of sustainability specifically in the context of less developed countries like India, the social dimensions are is equally a major thrust area along with environmental indicators. Content analysis technique has been used to evaluate sustainable banking performance of the banks and Mann–Whitney U test used to determine the differences in sustainable banking performance of the banks in India. Findings: In Indian banking sector, the adoption of the international sustainability code of conduct is still in its nascent stage. The research indicates that sustainability issues which are of the highest priority for the banks are directly related to their business operations such as financial inclusion, financial literacy and energy efficiency, and banks are more focussed on addressing social dimension of sustainability in banking rather than important dimensions of sustainable banking, namely, environmental management, development of green products and services and sustainability reporting. Practical implications: The application of the proposed framework reflects the status quo of sustainable banking in India. This study is useful for the banks and all the stakeholders in understanding more about the shortcomings in integrating sustainability issues in banking. Further, the present study also redresses the extant research dearth in the field of sustainable banking in the Indian context. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies evaluating the sustainable banking performance of the Indian banking sector. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The knowledge-based view (KBV) in the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is a debatable topic in the current literature. Although convergence of technological and financial literacy (techno-finance literacy) is an essential knowledge-based tool to address rapid digitalization of business, the influence of techno-finance literacy in the development of SMEs is still not adequately researched. Drawing upon KBV, we developed a single-mediator structural model with an aim to explore the effect of techno-finance literacy and enterprise risk management (ERM) practices (applications) on the performance of SMEs. A self-administered structured questionnaire was employed to collect data from 319 chief financial offers (CFOs) in Sri Lankan SMEs. The outcome of our study highlights that techno-finance literacy is a significant determinant of two endogenous constructs, namely, SME performance and ERM practices. Furthermore, ERM practices of SMEs were also positively affected to the SME performance. Moreover, ERM practices were observed to have a partial mediation on the relationship between financial literacy and SME performance. These findings form the basis for theories in techno-finance literacy and SME performance, as well as present managerial implications to enhance the performance of SMEs. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - We use unique administrative data and a quasi-field experiment of exogenous allocation in Sweden to estimate medium-and longer-run effects of peoples' exposure to financially literate neighbors on their financial behavior. We contribute evidence of (1) a causal impact of exposure and of a social multiplier of financial knowledge and (2) unfavorable distributional aspects of externalities. Exposure promotes saving in private retirement accounts and stockholding, especially when neighbors have economics or business education, but only for educated households and for substantial interaction possibilities. Findings point to a transfer of knowledge rather than mere imitation or effects through labor, education, or mobility channels.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a study that examined College of Business and College of Education students’ conceptions of the term “Spiritual Capital.” Participants (N = 56) consisted of students at a public Midwestern university in the United States. Results found that almost half of the participants considered spiritual capital to represent a concept related to spirituality. Participants also mentioned values, religion, economics, or broader society in their definitions, though other participants acknowledged their uncertainty regarding the term. Results of Chi-Square tests and Fisher’s exact test indicated no significant relationship between participants’ major and any of the coding categories used. © 2021, Association for Social Studies Educa.

AB  - This research investigates the role of financial literacy on initiating and achieving a favorable negotiation outcome in an employment context. With a goal of improving long-term financial well-being, extant research examines whether increasing a person's understanding of basic financial concepts (“financial literacy”) improves his/her financial decision-making. The current research proposes broader effects of financial literacy via negotiation behavior. We follow prior research to measure financial literacy both objectively (as the accurate assessment of basic financial concepts, “financial knowledge”) and subjectively (as confidence in the application of basic financial skills and concepts, “financial confidence”). In a series of studies engaging students from undergraduate business courses and adults recruited from an online crowdsourcing service, this research examines the relationship between these measures of financial literacy and (a) the likelihood of initiating a negotiation and (b) the likely outcome from a negotiation, if initiated. Results suggest that financial confidence impacts participants’ willingness to engage in negotiation, while financial knowledge impacts the level of participants’ first offer. These findings suggest financial literacy has important implications for career advancement and compensation, as well as the successful management of interpersonal communications, even in fields not traditionally thought of as focusing on numerical reasoning skills. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In the last decade, developed and emerging economies have become increasingly aware of the importance of ensuring that their citizens are financially literate. Eighteen countries and economies, including 13 OECD countries, participated for the first time in 2012 on the financial literacy assessment of 15-year-old students. Financial literacy scores varied according to the participating countries, and they were determined by factors related to the teaching-learning process, especially those related to the delivery of financial education in schools. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the provision of financial education in the school curriculum across all the countries that participated in PISA 2012—data from 2015 did not allow such analysis. We measured the direct effect of different ways of financial education delivery on students' financial literacy scores, after controlling for math and reading performance, and individual characteristics of students and their schools. The majority of the countries have introduced financial education topics in the curriculum somehow. But only in the Flemish Community of Belgium, the United States, and Latvia—and to a lesser extent in Australia, Estonia, France, Israel, Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, and the Slovak Republic—the way how financial education (FE) is delivered is positively correlated with students' financial literacy scores: FE taught as part of business or economics courses in Belgium, FE taught as part of a cross-curricular subject in the U.S., and FE taught as part of mathematics in Latvia. Our main findings pose fundamental challenges for educational policy regarding school-based FE. The first is to decide at what age (grade) interventions should be introduced into the education system so that students are not only financially literate but also financially competent. The second is to devise instructional approaches that more effectively lead young people to put pertinent financial knowledge into practice and to do so correctly when they make financial decisions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the attitudes to entrepreneurship of Italian households, focusing on the importance of financial literacy and digital skills as potentially relevant factors shaping entrepreneurship. We put the gender focus to our analysis to detect whether, and to what extent, women and men differ in their propensity to run a business. We carry out our research by using the Bank of Italy SHIW dataset for the years 2008 and 2010. Our findings suggest a strong heterogeneity between men and women in the role played by financial literacy and digital skills. Results show a positive and significant correlation between financial literacy and the probability of being an entrepreneur but only for men. We also find that digitally skilled male respondents are much more likely to be entrepreneurs. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) plays a significant role for the economic development of a country. Specifically, the existence of SMEs is to contribute in poverty alleviation through job creation. However, not many SMEs can survive and grow their business due to limited access to obtain resources such as financial, technological, and human resources. One of the factors that inhibit the development of MSMEs in Indonesia is the lack of knowledge and management of personal finance. In addition, the participation rate of SMEs to financial institutions is still very low, with only 30% able to access financing. This study aims to analyse the level of financial literacy, the factors that affect the level of financial literacy, and the correlation between the level of financial literacy (proxied by general knowledge, risk management, savings and credits, and investment) with funding decision. The data used are primary data and secondary data, with data collection methods conducted in this study are literature studies, interviews and questionnaires with SMEs in Bandung, Indonesia, with a sample used as many as 97 respondents. The respondents’ financial literacy in low level on general financial knowledge, savings & credits, and investment. But they have medium financial literacy level on insurance. The data processed using discriminant analysis, shows that the average financial literacy level which is in low level and has no effect on funding decision-making.

AB  - Learning outcomes: The learning outcomes are as follows: Students/participants can understand the type of financial fraud pertaining to the case; Students/participants can analyse the case using the fraud triangle perspective; students/participants can describe detection/anticipation strategies to prevent such acts from taking place in the future; students/participants can evaluate the case using the ethical decision-making framework; and students/participants can comprehend the importance of financial literacy when investing, especially in this digital era. Case overview/synopsis: This case discusses the investment funds mismanagement accusations addressed to PT Jouska Finansial Indonesia (Jouska). Jouska is a financial planner business that was immensely popular among Indonesian young investors. It actively posted interesting content on its social media accounts, gaining attention from the millennial and Gen Z generations. However, in 2020, many of its clients reported and filed complaints that their portfolio values decreased significantly because of Jouska’s decision to invest their funds in low-quality stocks. Jouska was also alleged to violate its role as a financial planner by being able to perform several activities that fell under the authority of investment managers. This case attracted the attention of authorities so that the Investment Alert Task Force (SWI) stopped Jouska’s operational activities and initiated an investigation into the case. SWI also blocked Jouska’s websites, applications and social media accounts, in cooperation with the Ministry of Communication and Information. Despite settlement agreements that Jouska claimed had been offered to several clients, at the end of 2020 some of its clients and former clients filed a formal lawsuit. As of January 2021, several alleged criminal actions attributed to Jouska were still under investigation, comprised of money laundering, clients’ funds embezzlement, fraud, and insider trading. In October 2021, Aakar’s status was a suspect in the allegations. This case is another example of investment misconduct or fraud; to put it another way, it is the effect. It is expected that the participants can deliberate other perspectives during the discussion that could be the cause of such a case, hence viewing it holistically.

AB  - The main objective of this research project is to create new model in the field of corporate financial literacy, with a special emphasis on the Hungarian SME sector. In our study we explore the interpretations and dimensions of corporate finance. Beyond the theoretical analysis, the study aims to justify the level and direction of the relationship between corporate financial literacy and corporate financial results, the efficiency of operations, the outcome of corporate financial decisions. It has been taken a 511-element representative sample from the Hungarian SME sector and built a linear regression model to find a significant moderation effect of financial literacy between financial performance and results. The method used in this study is a literature review analysis of manuscripts discussing topics related to financial literacy, corporate sustainability, published in the last 10 years. Our results show that there are positive and significant relationships between company management and corporate financial literacy. It has been also established in our analysis that the level of corporate financial literacy influences financial results and the effectiveness of operations in companies. This paper draws the attention of business leaders to the importance of financial awareness to help stakeholders and companies to provide better solutions to the existing environmental and economic challenges. The study offers useful policy input for corporate and economic policy decision-makers, which could also help improve the competitiveness of national economies. © 2021, Czestochowa University of Technology.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the role of women and the strategic dimensions in accelerating poverty reduction. In the midst of the pandemic situation Covid-19 caused many medium and large businesses that experienced a downturn. Micro businesses began to grow amid the economic difficulties faced by the community to be able to survive. The role of women in accelerating the poverty reduction through the management of micro businesses is a top priority for sustainable development. This research is located in Buleleng Regency, Bali Province and uses quantitative methods. Primary data sources were obtained using questionnaires sent to respondents. The data analysis method uses multiple linear regression. The population consists of micro-enterprises managed by women in 2019 of 246 businesses. The selecting samples method is based on convenience sampling and the entire population was sampled in this study. The results in this study indicate that financial literacy and women empowerment had positive and significant effects on women performance in microbusinesses. Interest in using e-commerce had no effect on women's performance in micro businesses. Without the use of e-commerce, it is believed that women in micro-businesses will be increasingly left behind by other business actors, and age matters in association with technology and competition between other business actors which will be tighter to have an impact on performance and sustainability of the business.  © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

AB  - Using panel data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) in 2013, 2015, and 2017 and the digital inclusive finance index developed by Peking University, this study examined impacts of the digital inclusive finance on household consumption and explored its mechanisms. Results suggest that the digital inclusive finance could promote households consumption. A heterogeneity analysis showed that households with fewer assets, lower income, less financial literacy and in third- and fourth-tier cities experienced larger facilitating effects of digital finance on consumption compared to their counterparts. For consumption categories, digital finance was positively correlated with food, clothing, house maintenance, medical care, and education and entertainment expenditures. In terms of consumption structure, digital finance mainly promoted the recurring household expenditures rather than the non-recurring expenditures. Further analyses based on the mediating model found that online shopping, digital payment, obtainment of online credit, purchase of financing products on the internet and business insurance, were the main mediating variables through which digital finance affected household consumption. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Loggers play critical roles in forest management and resource production, yet supply chain pressures can challenge their economic sustainability. We examine logger perspectives on efficiency, financial challenges, and potential solutions from two contrasting perspectives: 1) business strategy and 2) treadmill of production, a sociological critique of resource production that links economic and ecological sustainability. To provide in-depth perspectives based on lived experiences, we conducted interviews with professional loggers and other stakeholders, focusing on firms with mechanized cut-to-length systems in Wisconsin and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. Our qualitative analysis revealed the intersection of factors that help explain financial stress. Loggers work on contract or buy stumpage from landowners and then sell to mills. Perceived challenges included competition in stumpage markets, relationships to mills that disadvantaged small firms, debt from mechanization, and site access through variable environmental conditions. Loggers worked to increase efficiency and production volume, though some loggers expressed the limits of increasing efficiency and production for improving profitability. Proposed solutions to reduce financial stress included long-term mill contracts, access to loans, and improved financial literacy. Nonetheless, individual firm efficiency will not address structural challenges such as loggers’ role in the supply chain between landowners and mills. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - An entrepreneur is often driven by a quest for innovation and creativity in a market, thus creating competition. The competition will create wealth, leading to improved living standards for individuals and the economy at large. Moreover, innovation and creation result in new and superior products that enable modern markets to be developed. However, the enthusiasm to become an entrepreneur is not the sole driving factor. One must know the importance of financial literacy. Besides, the negative stigma due to the COVID-19 pandemic ruined many lives and impacted businesses with less money due to the reduction of clientele; also, it had impacted budding entrepreneurs (at early start-up stages, and hardly have had experience between 1-3 years) with fewer opportunities to make money. That reduced the willingness of entrepreneurs to invest capital in the business due to raging losses. The current article presents the importance of financial literacy for budding entrepreneurs. To find and measure the financial literacy among budding entrepreneurs, the data were distributed to 223 entrepreneurs; however, 179 were finally used for analysis due to several reasons mentioned in the research methodology. The data was collected from five districts of the South region of India (Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu) and the snowball technique is used in the analysis. The study revealed that most budding entrepreneurs lack proper financial literacy. The study found that Financial Skills, Financial Knowledge, Financial Attitude, Social Interactions & Past Experiences, Financial Support & Guidance directly influenced Financial Literacy levels among entrepreneurs. The study also suggests that aspiring entrepreneurs should be given practical financial training sessions; it should be made mandatory. © Universal Journal of Accounting and Finance 2021.

AB  - There is a genuine demand for finance requirement in the remote rural areas, absence of formal banking forced private lenders exploit the rural public. Government of India made several attempts towards financial inclusion of the poor, since independence, particularly in rural areas. Lack of financial literacy and no bank branch operation in their remote location restrains them to have access to formal banking. To overcome these constraints the RBI introduced ICT based Business Correspondences as agent to undertake banking activity in the year 2006.Though BC model was successfully performing well, but the growth and share of Business correspondence decreasing gradually. Further, penetration of the usage of mobile technology even in the remote rural areas opens positively for the successful performance of BCs in rural. Hence this research paper is a descriptive study which focuses on understanding BCs as a growing avenue for ensuring financial inclusion in Rural India. © BEIESP.

AB  - Lack of access to financial services leaves fishing households and their fishing businesses with limited options to obtain financing and manage cash flow for family expenses or business investments. The lack of access is filled by informal lenders that can also be the primary buyers of fish or the owners of the boats. For rural fishing households, access to formal financial services, also known as financial inclusion, can bring increased financial resilience to the household. The paper reviews the current barriers to financial inclusion of small-scale fishing households such as limited financial capability and literacy, lack of assets for collateral, geographic distance from a financial institution and lack of formal identification. It also discusses solutions to address these barriers including financial literacy, de-risking financial institutions, financial data collection, provision of a range of financial services besides credit, and understanding the client that will enable fishing households to retain control over their earnings and savings. Financial inclusion can help reduce the different vulnerabilities of poor fishing households and rural communities and lead to improved economic resilience. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate whether small finance banks (SFBs) in India are working towards financial inclusion through qualitative studies. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a phenomenological approach in which semi-structured interviews were conducted with the employees of two SFBs in Mumbai with different specializations. Employee experience was captured to grasp, interpret and code data for the creation of different themes. Findings: This research shows that the current literature on financial inclusion is inadequate to explain the behavior of the needy in India. Study found multiple themes of financial inclusion, namely, financial literacy, self-esteem, use of technology, prompt repayment, credit identity, cross-referencing and financial stability. Although overall results are positive, to generalize the results, SFBs need to spend some more time in business. The findings of this study can be of global benefit to micro-finance organizations of a similar scale to achieve financial inclusion and business improvement. Research limitations/implications: This qualitative study was performed at a single location and with a limited sample size, which underlines the need for repeated exercises at multiple locations with a larger sample size to establish a broader logical generality. It also points out the need for a study of employee themes to enhance the business processes of SFBs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this qualitative study is first attempt to figure out the extent of work done by SFBs in India in promoting financial inclusion. Themes related to financial inclusion can provide further thought process for policymakers for financial inclusion and business improvement. Findings refer not only to Indian organizations but also to small banks around the world to recognize the underpinnings of financial inclusion and what small banks and micro-finance institutions can do to make it meaningful. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - There is a sizable informal business sector in emerging markets. This paper investigates informal businesses’ accessibility to formal credit in China and their owners’ financial literacy as a potential determinant. By examining informal businesses in urban areas from the 2015 China Household Finance Survey, we find that business owners’ financial literacy is positively associated with the likelihood of their businesses holding bank loans. This positive relationship only exists among businesses whose owners have rural hukou and it is more pronounced in areas where formal-credit accessibility is lower. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Orientation: In this ever-changing business milieu, poverty alleviation has turned into an important issue after the publication of the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which aim at eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions by 2030. Research purpose: This study investigates the effect of entrepreneurship education, budgeting financial literacy and access to credit facilities on entrepreneurial performance and poverty reduction. Motivation for the study: There is a lack of literature that studies the effect of entrepreneurship education, budgeting financial literacy and access to credit facilities on entrepreneurial performance and poverty reduction in an emerging economy, such as South Africa. Research design, approach and method: The study adopted a quantitative approach. The examination was completed in the Vhembe District of Limpopo province, South Africa, where many people live in poverty. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 150 managers of rural small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To test the hypothesised model, structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis was employed using the Smart partial least squares (PLS) software. Main findings: The findings uncovered that entrepreneurship education, budgeting financial literacy and access to credit facilities positively impact entrepreneurial performance of SMEs and reduce poverty. Practical/managerial implications: The present research provides theoretical implications for academics in the field of entrepreneurship, precisely, by enhancing an understanding of the link between entrepreneurship education, budgeting financial literacy, access to credit facilities, entrepreneurship performance and poverty reduction. On the practitioners’ side, this work offers avenues for SME managers to improve entrepreneurial ventures and eventually eliminate household poverty. Moreover, this study also offers policy implications. Existing policies, for example, can be updated, with the goal of improving entrepreneurial performance of SMEs and reducing poverty. Contribution/value-add: This article provides useful insights into and suggestions on the way forward. Furthermore, it contributes to the existing knowledge base in the field of entrepreneurship. As such, this research is important for SME managers because most of them endeavour to enhance entrepreneurial performance and alleviate poverty in their communities. © AOSIS (pty) Ltd.

AB  - A large number of researchers are engaged in studying the determinants and consequences of China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Although optimism abounds, in particular, few empirical evidence is available for Pakistani businessmen and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) operators on how to benefit from this tremendous opportunity. Our study examined how top managers/owners of Pakistani energy sector SMEs can innovate their businesses to reap the benefits of CPEC. We have examined the influence of demographic factors (age, education, experience, and financial literacy) of top managers/owners on different forms of innovation (product, process, marketing, and organization) and their consequent chances of success through participation in CPEC. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Motivation: While livelihoods are increasingly promoted for refugees in long-term situations of displacement, refugees can rarely access microfinance loans—the very start-up capital generally considered necessary for creating businesses. Yet across Kampala, Uganda, refugees meet to place small amounts of money into group savings and take out and repay microloans. Purpose: This article sheds light on this underexplored phenomenon through an empirical study of refugee-led microfinance groups in Kampala and an overview of the existing local landscape of refugee-serving organizations and microfinance institutions providing loans. We analytically reflect on the role of trust in executing microfinance programmes both for and by refugees. Approach and Methods: We conducted snowball and purposive sampling, semi-structured qualitative interviews, focus group discussions, and non-participant observation. Findings: Our study found that refugee-led microfinance groups have created a loan structure that is successful for refugees—because it was developed by refugees—with low default rates. This success is underpinned by strong community trust between members. These groups access vulnerable populations important to humanitarian organizations, including women, single mothers, unregistered refugees and the very poor. However, despite filling an important gap in livelihoods assistance—the provision of business capital—refugee-led microfinance groups lack large amounts of capital to loan members, and do not feel they provide adequate business, livelihoods and financial literacy trainings. Policy Implications: Our findings suggest that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should support existing groups through offering safe spaces to hold meetings, and with financial and business trainings. Debunking stereotypes of refugees held by financial providers, and advocating for refugees’ financial rights remains crucial. Providing loan capital to groups to enable members to take out larger loans may offer another means of support, but collaboration between formal microfinance institutions or NGOs and refugee-led groups must reinforce rather than devalue the networks of trust that contribute to grassroots savings and loan groups’ success. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - This qualitative study focused on the documentation and analysis of the narratives on the diaspora stories of the overseas Filipino workers in Singapore in the contexts of their fear, opportunities, and management initiatives, viewed through management perspectives. The Filipino diaspora has gone global, having overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) present in all parts of the world. Push factors motivated many Filipinos to seek better job opportunities in developed countries such as Singapore. However, the length of stay is limited by the working pass. Narrative inquiry as a research design was used, and the data were collected through face-to-face interviews with the storytellers who are working in Singapore for five years and more under working pass. The narratives were themed and analyzed, and the results were inferred with the functions of management to surface the management perspectives. The storytellers were motivated by a better quality of life and a higher salary, and they fear the unknown and the uncertainties on their return home. As for opportunities, the storytellers consider putting a business in the future. For management initiatives, their employers provide programs for skills development. The narratives surfaced plausible inferences on the planning, leading, organizing, and controlling functions of management. The study concluded that the OFWs are adamant to return home because of the better quality of life in Singapore. They also give high regard to family and are strengthening their financial literacy. Their narratives led to recommendations for the multinational companies where they work to enhance their international management and leadership styles, establish stronger labor welfare, and consider distance employment. © 2021 by De La Salle University.

AB  - Purpose: University students are known to face many challenges in achieving high financial literacy. The purpose of this paper is to examine the level of financial literacy among Malaysian Muslim undergraduates as explained through sociocultural variables. Furthermore, this paper explores a few additional Islamic measurements as part of assessing the level of financial literacy among the students. Design/methodology/approach: The questionnaires were drafted based on a multi-dimensional financial literacy model and distributed conveniently to 330 respondents. Post-interviews were also conducted with selected students to further comprehend the sociocultural context. Findings: The findings suggest that exposing students to financial education and practices influence their financial literacy scores. Students who attended muamalat-related courses demonstrated better financial literacy scores. Meanwhile, post-interview results indicate that the students’ social environment and interactions also play important roles in enhancing their financial literacy. Hence, it is believed that it is essential to embed Islamic-based measurements to equip students with financial literacy in tandem with their pedagogic development. The results thus extend previous studies by confirming the importance of Islamic-based finance- and business-related knowledge for all tertiary students. Furthermore, the curricula should be made compatible to their studying environment and attuned to their values and cultures. Practical implications: The findings suggest the introduction of personal financial and muamalat-based knowledge and practices relative to their Islamic programme orientation. This should take place during the students’ academic years and across all academic programmes’ orientation. The study also highlights the importance of developing special measurements of Islamic financial literacy for Muslims congruent to their distinct Islamic identity. Social implications: The study indicates the importance of high financial literacy among tertiary students for them to have a financially stable future. Originality/value: The research is original in its use of several measurements of financial literacy that embedded Islamic teachings concomitant to the Muslim respondents. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Inclusive finance is a core concept of finance that makes various financial products and services accessible and affordable to all individuals and businesses, especially those excluded from the formal financial system. One of the leading forces affecting people's ability to access financial services in rural areas is financial literacy. This study investigated the impacts of financial knowledge on financial access through banking, microfinance, and fintech access using the Bangladesh rural population data. We employed three econometrics models: logistic regression, probit regression, and complementary log–log regression to examine whether financial literacy significantly affects removing the barriers that prevent people from participating and using financial services to improve their lives. The empirical findings showed that knowledge regarding various financial services factors had significant impacts on getting financial access. Some variables such as profession, income level, knowledge regarding depositing and withdrawing money, and knowledge regarding interest rate highly affected the overall access to finance. The study's results provide valuable recommendations for the policymaker to improve financial inclusion in the developing country context. A comprehensive and long-term education program should be delivered broadly to the rural population to make a big stride in financial inclusion, a key driver of poverty reduction and prosperity boosting. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The increasing need for a well-prepared nursing workforce is indisputable, and the reliable income and steady employment of a nursing career are highly attractive. Augmenting nurses’ business acumen and security through universal mastery of financial literacy – including the knowledge and skills of debt, investments, and budgeting – are essential in accessing health care, alleviating poverty, and eliminating inequality. This column explores financial literacy as a subset of health literacy, empowering nurse leaders to positively impact patients, families, communities, and nurses themselves. © 2021, Anthony J.

AB  - Recent years have seen great innovation in the field of payments.This paper discusses which aspects of the payment process may be relevant for retailers and the innovations that may be useful for meeting retailers’ needs. Special attention is devoted to how small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) can make effective use of such advancements to simplify the payment process, ensure a frictionless experience for their customers, speed up the finality of fund settlement and reduce processing costs.The paper discusses the importance of giving careful consideration to the selling mode and size of the firm, as well as the implementation costs.The paper shows that while some innovations are easy to implement, for instance, because banks and service providers supply turnkey solutions, others require more complex arrangements and the involvement of third-party providers. The paper highlights the importance of cooperation agreements between SMEs, specific awareness campaigns and financial literacy initiatives to put SMEs in a better position to leverage payment innovations and improve their business opportunities. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.

AB  - Romania is in a rather dishonorable position from the financial literacy perspective in the European Union, ranking last among countries. To increase the level of financial education of the Romanian population, public and private institutions, organizations, and companies have recently taken the initiative in this field, mostly after 2015. Our contribution builds on these recent developments and aims at testing the level of basic financial literacy of Romanian university students, enrolled in business and economics studies, using the OECD Financial literacy test. Data was collected through an online survey on a voluntary basis, and the responses were analyzed using statistical indicators. Results indicate a rather high level of financial literacy among students, but also significant differences among respondents that may be explained by several demographic characteristics and specific attributes. The most important characteristics that influence the degree of financial literacy of students are age, students' cycle of studies, the way the students live, property ownership and students' involvement in financial market transactions and contracts. We stress towards the need to act through concrete measures to improve young people financial literacy, as a necessary condition to navigate in an increasingly complex environment, where finance plays an essential role. © 2020 Horobeţ Alexandra et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to examine the mediating role of financial inclusion in the relationship between financial inclusion and capital structure decisions in small industries in rural areas of West Sumatera. The population of this study was small embroidery industries in Pariaman, with a total sample of 143 small embroidery enterprises selected using the purposive sampling method. This study adopted and employed Sobel and Kenny & Baron tests to examine the mediating effect of financial inclusion in the relationship between financial literacy and capital structure. Research findings revealed that financial inclusion was a significant mediator in the relationship between financial literacy and capital structure decision as regards small embroidery enterprises. Financial literacy did not have a direct effect on capital structure decision, whilst financial inclusion acts as full mediation in my research. Moreover, financial inclusion increased the relationship between financial literacy and capital structure by 74.2%. Thus, these findings indicate that financial literacy possibly cannot improve the capital structure of embroidery businesses in rural areas of West Sumatera without financial inclusion. © 2019 SERSC.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of financial and digital literacy on growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) managed by women in Indonesia. Data were collected through questionnaires of women entrepreneurs in Palembang, Indonesia. For the purpose of comparison, data of men entrepreneurs were also collected. The variables employed are latent variables such as financial literacy, digital literacy, SME’s growth which are derived from a series of questions to indicate each variable. A total of 240 women and 240 men were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results reveal that both financial and digital literacy had positive and significant effects on return on assets. On the other hand, only digital literacy had positive and significant effects on growth. The findings further evidence that women had a lower level of digital knowledge compared to men. Furthermore, the results show that in the short term, financial literacy and digital literacy are important to understand and implement. But in the long run, digital literacy plays an important role because it impacts business growth. This is in line with an increasingly fierce market competition where the market is also shifting from traditional markets to modern markets. Not only the market, but consumers are also shifting from traditional consumers to digital consumers. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Saving promotion interventions have gained momentum in international development in recent years. Our analysis investigates whether saving promotion can effectively increase savings, consumption, and future-oriented investments in Sub-Saharan Africa. In an extensive search of 28 academic and policy-focused databases in the fields of economics, psychology, and social sciences, 9330 titles and abstracts of published and unpublished studies were screened and 27 randomized controlled trials on saving promotion interventions fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 24 studies reporting on an aggregated sample of 87,025 individuals provided sufficient information to be included in the meta-analysis. Robust-variance estimations of pooled effect sizes show small but significant impacts on poverty reduction, including increases in household expenditures and incomes, higher returns from family businesses, and improved food security. They also show positive and significant impacts on more intermediate outcomes including total savings, pro-saving attitudes, financial literacy, and investments in small-scale family businesses. Our results do not show significant effects on assets, housing quality, education, or health. Results from meta-regressions suggest that supply-based programs are superior to demand-enhancing program types such as financial education. They further reveal reduced program effectiveness for women. Overall, findings from this analysis suggest that saving promotion schemes are highly relevant in reducing poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa, and that future efforts should focus on expansion of banking services to the poor as well as gender-sensitive programming. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article reports on the status of consumer education in Canada in 2016 (junior and senior high), relative to the 2015-initiated federal national financial education/literacy strategy. Questions addressed: (1) Is it necessary to have separate financial education curricula when consumer education is available? and (2) Are the existing consumer education curricula adequate? After conceptualizing consumer education and literacy relative to financial education and literacy, a content analysis of provincial and territorial education documents identified 64 courses containing consumer-related content in seven subject areas. The majority (73%) of the 216 instances of consumer-related content-mostly (68%) found in home economics/family studies, social studies, mathematics, and business-pertained to resource management, with equal coverage for each of citizen participation (14%) and decision making (13%). Most (73%) of the courses were not offered until senior high. Results confirmed a fragmented and inconsistent approach to consumer education across subject areas, grade levels, provinces/territories, and regions. To stimulate dialogue, the national financial education strategy is framed as a stop-gap measure until there is political will for a pan-Canadian consumer education curriculum, predicated on the assumption that consumer education (not financial education) better prepares citizens for any future global depression. © 2018 Canadian Society for the Study of Education.

AB  - Personal financial literacy (PFL) is an imperative life skill that all 21st-century students should have. Research shows that the levels of financial literacy in both developing and developed countries are very low across people of all ages. This deplorable state of affairs has negative implications on the well-being of the populace, as evidenced by increased indebtedness, lower saving, poor planning for retirement, and the making of many poor personal financial decisions. Recognizing the potential benefits of financial literacy at both individual and national levels, many countries have started to offer financial education in their schools. This article analyzed the business subjects’ curriculum at secondary school level in Botswana and literature published on the subject of PFL, and found that there exists a gap in this area and a need to offer PFL to all learners in the school system. Despite the need for such a move, Botswana does not have a deliberate program in its curriculum that specifically addresses this problem. This article discusses the benefits of personal financial education, the inadequacy of current business subjects to meet this need, and concludes by recommending a mandatory PFL subject in the Botswana secondary school curriculum. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The case depicts a situation faced by a company in the business of financial inclusion services. FINO PayTech Limited (popularly known as FINO) was the first mover in the blue ocean of financial inclusion business in India. It is quoted as the world's largest banking agent manager. Formed in Mumbai in 2006 with the mission to solve problem of financial exclusion, FINO entered the market riding on the biometric smartcard and hand held devices technology and had since grown exponentially. It served more than 64 million end customers all across India adding average of one million new customers to the formal financial system every month. FINO's uniqueness came from factors such as diversified product offering (which ranges from savings, credit, payment services, remittances, insurance, financial literacy, and so on), a robust technology, a dedicated channel of bandhus (banking correspondents/agents) and mature processes. The top leadership envisaged that FINO could not remain limited to savings and withdrawals activity if it had to reach many more million customers. The credit and micro insurance services had to be provided at the doorstep of the people and only then could FINO possibly project itself as a multi-product delivery company and that's the challenge management was encountering when scaling up in a constrained regulatory framework. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Beef businesses in northern Australia are facing increased pressure to be productive and profitable with challenges such as climate variability and poor financial performance over the past decade. Declining terms of trade, limited recent gains in on-farm productivity, low profit margins under current management systems and current climatic conditions will leave little capacity for businesses to absorb climate change-induced losses. In order to generate a whole-of-business focus towards management change, the Climate Clever Beef project in the Maranoa-Balonne region of Queensland trialled the use of business analysis with beef producers to improve financial literacy, provide a greater understanding of current business performance and initiate changes to current management practices. Demonstration properties were engaged and a systematic approach was used to assess current business performance, evaluate impacts of management changes on the business and to trial practices and promote successful outcomes to the wider industry. Focus was concentrated on improving financial literacy skills, understanding the business' key performance indicators and modifying practices to improve both business productivity and profitability. To best achieve the desired outcomes, several extension models were employed: the 'group facilitation/empowerment model', the 'individual consultant/mentor model' and the 'technology development model'. Providing producers with a whole-of-business approach and using business analysis in conjunction with on-farm trials and various extension methods proved to be a successful way to encourage producers in the region to adopt new practices into their business, in the areas of greatest impact. The areas targeted for development within businesses generally led to improvements in animal performance and grazing land management further improving the prospects for climate resilience.

AB  - Australian rangeland pastoralism is now a marginal economic activity. To survive as an industry, it must retain critical mass and to do that, the majority of producers need to be financially sustainable. Significant change has taken place in the past 40 years to facilitate this, but this change appears to have had limited enduring value for much of the industry. The productivity of the average northern rangeland beef herd in absolute terms is poor and is far from being competitive now, let alone in the future. If preservation of the natural resource base is included as a sustainability criterion, the industry outlook becomes even more uncertain. The conundrum is that it has never been more opportune to succeed in rangeland pastoralism, but the evidence is that most producers do not. The conclusion is that the lack of financial literacy and business skill remains the biggest impediment to most pastoralists achieving financial sustainability. © Australian Rangeland Society 2015.

AB  - Asset accumulation is especially challenging for low- and moderate-income households, which often face fixed costs in their budgets that limit their ability to save. Key fixed costs include expenses associated with housing, such as rent, mortgage, taxes, and utilities. In 2011, 64% of households making $15,000-29,999 were cost-burdened (spent 30% or more of their income on housing). Data were collected in 2007 at two sites using a mixed-methods approach. A sample of 175 households were examined to determine how certain low- and moderate-income households with varying levels of cost burden managed to build savings and why others struggled with the same goal. Households with savings above the sample median of $112 saved an average of $2,304 (with a median of $803). Households with savings below the group's median had an average of $13 in savings, with a median of zero. Barriers to saving experienced by our asset-challenged households include unpredicted shocks, low incomes, unemployment and chronic sickness, large debt, multiple dependents, and prioritizing human capital investments and consumption over saving. Pathways to savings include coresidence, sharing business profits based on need, and financial assistance without obligation of repayment. Other pathways include financial literacy about budgets, savings, and other investments. © 2013 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

AB  - Using data collected by the National Financial Capability Study, a survey recently commissioned by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, this paper investigates the correlations between subjectively and objectively assessed measures of financial knowledge, and the probability of having savings adequate to cover 3 months of typical expenses. Results indicate that households who are more financially knowledgeable or more confident in their financial ability are significantly more likely to report having emergency funds. These findings support the growing literature on the relationship between financial knowledge and economic behaviors and have wide policy implications. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The answer to the challenging question, "Should one either invest in tangible resources or intangible resources/capabilities?" is still fragmented. In prior studies, more emphasis is given to tangible resources, while intangible resources have comparatively received minor attention, despite their significant role in the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Particularly the role of the intangible skills; intellectual capital, financial literacy (FL), and business experience (BE) in resource acquisition and sustainable competitive performance has missed in prior studies. Grounded on the resource-based view and upper echelon theory, this study examines the role of intellectual capital in sustainable competitive performance with a mediating role of resource acquisition. This research also assesses the moderating role of financial literacy and business experience between intellectual capital and resource acquisition. Data are collected through structured questionnaires from 384 owners/managers of Pakistani SMEs. After analyzing the data through structural equation modeling (SEM), the results indicate that intellectual capital helps managers in acquiring valuable resources, which in turn enhance sustainable competitive performance. Resource acquisition partially mediates the relation between intellectual capital and sustainable competitive performance. Financial literacy is a significant predictor of resource acquisition, but it does not significantly moderate the relation between intellectual capital and sustainable competitive performance. Business experience significantly boosts the acquisition of resources and strengthens the path between intellectual capital and resource acquisition. SMEs should encourage their managers to acquire unique, rare, and immutable external resources in the turbulent markets. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Recent years have brought a gradual shift of responsibility for pension provisions, financial planning, health care and various insurances from governmental institutions and firms to individuals. To tackle this challenge, individuals need applied financial literacy and not merely theoretical knowledge about financial products and mechanisms that does not reflect real-life situations. We survey 448 business students in Canada, Denmark, Germany and Iceland to examine how financial literacy is expressed in their financial portfolios. We contrast these findings with the respondents' own expectations and needs. The results show that most respondents exhibit good financial literacy as well as a realistic assessment of risk and return and their impact on (financial) well-being. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the level of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) business owners–managers’ financial literacy and its impact on firm’s performance. The article applied a random sample and structural equation modelling (SEM) approaches in assessing the influence of SME business owners–managers’ level of financial literacy within the three states in the southwest Nigeria. The findings show the complete effect of business owner–manager’s financial knowledge, financial awareness and financial attitude in converting financial literacy to increase in firm performance. Also, they confirm that financial knowledge and awareness of SME business owners–managers are obviously not a prerequisite for the performance of SMEs, but entrepreneur characteristics in decision-making and relationship to financial attitude have a comparison with financial literacy. The research limitation evolves from cross section information observation that solely covers the southwestern part of the country. Additionally, inspired to meet the analysis gap is panel data analysis. Training courses through strategic orientation on the attitudinal perception of SME business owner–manager and basic business management skills, capacity-building aspect, leadership development as well as networking via relationship marketing and management on financial literacy may have significant effect on SMEs’ performance and growth for the managers in general in Nigeria. The article is one of the first to examine the level of financial literacy of SME business owners–managers in Nigeria. The article therefore sets an important benchmark for further research in this area. © 2017, © 2017 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

AB  - Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs) contributed 29.6% of GDP in Malaysia in 2005, and by 2014 its share was 35.9%. The involvement of SMEs in the Halal industry is also increasing and the business owner involved in Halal production should choose Islamic business financing. However, Islamic financing in Malaysia has been declining. This paper looks at the concept of Islamic financial literacy and to measure Islamic financial literacy. The measurement of Islamic financial literacy in this paper is based on the principle of Islamic finance, and includes concepts such as Mudarabah, Musharakah, Ijarah, Murabahah, Istisna and Quard Hassan. Through the Islamic financial intelligent (i-FiQ) the study hopes to advance Islamic finance. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

AB  - Objective: Our purpose was to describe the financial knowledge, habits and attitudes of chiropractic students. Methods: We designed a cross-sectional survey to measure basic financial knowledge, current financial habits, risk tolerance, and beliefs about future income among 250 students enrolled in business courses at one US chiropractic college. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Results: We received 57 questionnaires (23% response rate). Most respondents would accumulate over $125,000 in student loan debt by graduation. Financial knowledge was low (mean 77%). Most respondents (72%) scored as average financial risk takers. Chiropractic students reported recommended short-term habits such as having checking accounts (90%) and health insurance (63%) or paying monthly bills (88%) and credit cards (60%). Few saved money for unplanned expenses (39%) or long-term goals (26%), kept written budgets (32%), or had retirement accounts (19%). Conclusion: These chiropractic students demonstrated inadequate financial literacy and did not engage in many recommended financial habits. © JCCA 2014.

AB  - Microfinance programmes have emerged to serve the poor who are excluded by conventional banks and financial institutions. However, in the context of Nepal, accessible and sustainable financial services are still limited. Only 40 per cent of Nepalese are served by formal financial institutions. Experience has shown that people living in extreme poverty need several forms of support, such as grants for livelihoods and for purchasing productive assets, business development training, and financial literacy. This paper discusses barriers surrounding supply and demand side of financial systems for promoting financial inclusion. It argues that reaching the ultra-poor is only possible if appropriate strategies are devised to address the existing barriers that prevent inclusion of the unserved and under-served. The paper presents lessons learned from several initiatives to enhance financial inclusion in Nepal, and suggests approaches for serving the ultra-poor in the future. © Practical Action Publishing, 2018.

AB  - Most doctors complete their medical training without sufficient knowledge of business and finance. This leads to inefficient financial decisions, avoidable losses, and unnecessary anxiety. A big part of the problem is that the existing options for gaining financial knowledge are flawed. The ideal solution is to provide a simple framework of financial literacy to all students: one that can be adapted to their specific circumstances. That framework must be delivered by an objective expert to young physicians before they complete medical training.

AB  - Around the globe, women’s income and wealth are increasing as never before. Prevailing economic, demographic, and technological changes are growing women’s financial strength and independence. Be it finance, marketing, supply chain or ICT based industry, women have made incredible strides, both at professional and social fronts, particularly in the two decades. Today they are better educated, well placed and have greater accountability in the corporate world and are frontrunners in many professions. Consequently, women, particularly in developing countries like India and China have become economic powerhouses. They not only significantly contribute to GDP but also are becoming a substantial untapped market for the wealth management industry. In this context, this study is an attempt to discuss the much talked about, but less understood, issue of women’s wealth management in the Indian context. The study is intended to explore financial planning awareness among working women and their attitude towards wealth management. The findings will help wealth managers and financial planners to develop a deeper understanding of female investors’ goals and priorities, investment patterns of the working women and to gain insight into gender specific investment behaviour of Indian investors. © 2019 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors.

AB  - The argument holds that visionary and dynamic small and medium enterprises (SMEs) tend to position growth at the centre of strategy. However, there has been a growing body of literature that has examined how financial literacy can support owner-managers of SMEs in making solid financial decisions that will enhance the growth of their businesses. In the present study, financial literacy and financial resource availability were modelled as different antecedents of SMEs growth. Nevertheless, the boundary condition for such models has received very little attention in the context of Ghana. Accordingly, in regard to resource-based view (RBV) logic, the current research examined the implications of contingency variable financial literacy (proficiency) on the relationship between financial resource availability and SMEs growth, particularly in the context of Ghana. The findings of the current research revealed that high financial literacy led to more positive effect of financial resource availability on SMEs growth. © Joseph Owusu, Mohammad Bin Ismail, Mohd Hassan Bin Mohd Osman, Garry Kuan, 2019

AB  - Background: Global concerns about financial literacy have heightened following the 2007– 2008 global financial crisis during which it became apparent that lack of financial literacy was one of the factors that contributed to detrimental financial decision making. This recognition shows that poor financial decisions have a harmful overspill impact on financial and economic stability in a country. Complex financial markets call for exceptional levels of financial competence to enable individuals and business people to make intelligent choices among competing financial products. The study was conducted in two provinces of Zimbabwe, namely, Harare and Mashonaland Central Province among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who were in operation. Aim: The study sought to ascertain the level of financial literacy among SMEs business owners and to identify factors that influence the financial literacy levels. The research will give an insight on the state of preparedness of SMEs to participate in highly complicated financial markets. This adds to the existing scarce literature in sub-Saharan Africa on financial literacy levels among SMEs. Setting: The study was conducted among SMEs who reside in two provinces of Zimbabwe namely Harare Province and Mashonaland Central province. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional research design was employed, with data collected by means of a questionnaire administered to a sample of 384 SMEs in Harare and Bindura districts. Results: Findings revealed lower levels of financial literacy among SMEs. The main variables influencing financial literacy levels were interest rates and inflation. Conclusion: The study concludes that financial literacy among SMEs is low, and hence there is a need to introduce financial literacy education among small business owners. It is recommended that measurement of financial literacy be extended to different population cohorts to provide baseline data on which policies can be crafted © 2019. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

AB  - Swamp buffalo cultivation in South Kalimantan was done in remote swampy areas for generations. Swamp buffalo livestock become potential as a producer of meat and income source and also as one unique natural attractions. Swamp buffalo was one national asset owned by South Kalimantan Province and has the potential to be developed. This enormous potential will certainly affect to increase breeder’s income and the government and will greatly affect the welfare and prosperity of breeders. The welfare and prosperity must be sought and cultivated by the breeders themselves. One effort was to increase the comprehension on how to manage the financial flows from the swamp buffalo business, as financial literacy skills. Based on the Phenomenology Method of Schultz, Data Triangulation and Focus Group Discussion, it was found that the average swamp buffalo farmers in Hulu Sungai Utara district did not manage financial report. It could be said that the community of swamp buffalo farmers in Hulu Sungai Utara District had not understanding Financial Literacy well. However, the Swamp Buffalo breeders in Sungai Utara District have been save saving with motivation to guard against unexpected calamities.

AB  - We organise a field experiment with smallholder farmers in Rwanda to measure the impact of financial literacy training on financial knowledge and behaviour. The training increased financial literacy of participants, changed their savings and borrowing behaviour and had a positive effect on the new business start-up. However, it failed to have a significant (short-term) impact on income. Using a two-stage regression framework, we identify enhanced financial literacy as one of the important factors explaining behavioural changes. We also test whether financial knowledge spillovers from trained farmers to their peers in local village banks but find no evidence for that. © 2014 Royal Economic Society

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the effect of different aspects, in terms of the theory of interpersonal behavior, on the adoption of non-cash transactions among batik small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Pekalongan, Indonesia. Partial least squares analysis results show that financial literacy has a positive influence on non-cash transaction attitudes. The attitudes in turn have a positive influence on the intention in non-cash transactions. Furthermore, repetitive behavior has a positive influence on non-cash transaction habits. The repetitive use of non-cash transactions by batik SMEs is driven by a motive to maintain acceptable business relations when related parties require cashless payments. The findings also imply that financial literacy is a relevant component in adopting the use of non-cash payments among batik SMEs. © 2019, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main goal of this paper is to compare the level of fi nancial literacy among the selected faculties of economics in Slovakia and to elaborate a comparison of fi nancial literacy level at both input and output level, i.e. between the university students at the beginning of their Bachelor study and the university students who are in the fi nal stage of their Master study. In addition, we want to analyze the level of fi nancial literacy by means of practical tasks aimed at confi rmation or rejection of the prospect theory principles. Concerning methods we statistically process our primary data which were collected through the survey 2015/2016 from Slovak University of economics in Košice, Prešov and Bratislava. Inter alia, we analyze correlative data dependence of selected variables. The survey is focused also on fi nancial behavior of respondents and their skills in terms of fi nancial literacy concept. Last but not least, we deal with features of respondents’ fi nancial decision making under the conditions of risk and uncertainty. At fi rst, we show that statistically signifi cant dependency of FL level on respondents’ sex does exist. Male respondents reached higher FL than female ones. Hypothesis of better high school education of economy at Business Secondary School was rejected, rate of fi nancially literate respondents who attended Grammar School or Business Secondary School is comparable. Subsequently, students in their last year of studies at EKF TUKE and NHF EUBA have signifi cantly higher level of FL than those students who are at the beginning of their studies. Contrary, at FM PU the rate of fi nancially illiterate fi rst-year students was lower than the rate of fi nancially literate students in their last year of studies. We found out a correlation of FL with decision-making based on prospect theory. The results of the presented research provide important information for policy makers who should refl ect on present status of this issue in Slovakia. © 2018, Technical University of Liberec.

AB  - Gamification has a clear influence on software design, development and plays an important role in the motivation and intention of users to use a website and buy online. Nevertheless, in the case of e-banking, the influence of gamification in software design and on the user's intention to use are still very unclear. We intend to verify how game design elements and mechanics combined in the design of a bank website, influence the intention of customers to use e-banking. To explore and analyze the effects of gamification on a bank website, we propose a conceptual model considering the interaction between six variables: gamification, ease of use, information, design, web page characteristics, and intention to use the website. To test this model we develop a quantitative study involving 219 bank customers as participants who interacted with a gamified e-banking website to manage their financial investments. Participants then responded to an online questionnaire (including items related to the main variables), in order to measure their reactions to gamified software and their intentions. All data were statistically analyzed and results indicate that gamification has a significant influence on the ease of use and the intention to use e-banking, as well as on the web design, information, and webpage characteristics. We find that gamification may motivate customers to use e-banking, and that it improves their financial literacy and facilitates online processes and transactions. This study provides insightful guidelines for web design, development and e-banking contents that can be taken into account by marketing, IT, and business teams working in electronic banks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates metaphors used in the marketplace when providing microcredit to micro and small enterprises (MSEs). Metaphors are associations between abstract concepts and tangible things, wherein the former is understood and even experienced in terms of the latter. This study culls metaphors from interviews with managers of microfinance institutions (MFIs) and their MSE customers and shows widespread use of metaphors by both groups. Three metaphoric themes emerged during the interviews: (1) love and war; (2) freedom and servitude; and (3) life and death. The widespread use of metaphors provides strong implications for communication in subsistence markets. Specifically, MFIs should intentionally use metaphors to compensate for MSEs' lack of business and financial literacy. The prevalence of metaphors in MFI-MSE conversations also suggests possibilities for consumer education in subsistence markets, thus contributing to research on macromarketing. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - Objectives of the Study: The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of financial literacy in the realization of financial inclusion in India. If we analyze the financial inclusion, we will found that achieving the financial inclusion is based on two pillars - demand side and supply side. Where availability of the financial products in the market is very important, equally important is the fact that people are aware of them and they are in a situation to demand those products. In this context, financial literacy among the masses is very important, so that people have the awareness about the financial climate and financial products. This will increase their capability to demand for the financial products. This way, it can achieve the target of financial inclusion. Research Methodology: The research work is based on the secondary data. These data are obtained fromRBI publications, research papers and text books. It also uses secondary data from various other sources- newspapers, journals and periodicals like Economic Times, Business Line, Micro-Finance world etc. The study is designed as follows: In section-1 we introduce the concept of financial inclusion. An attempt is made to understand meaning, role and importance of financial inclusion. Section-2 will describe the link between financial inclusion and financial literacy and the various facets of it. In section-3 we provide our conclusions and some suggestions. Findings: Financial inclusion is an attempt to achieve the ultimate objective i.e. inclusive growth. Financial inclusion is an important constituent of this, because a financially deprivement is a very big deterrent of a person's overall development. Our study reveals that the final answer of financial inclusion rests on both sides-demand side and supply side. It is now, becoming increasingly apparent that addressing the problem of financial exclusion will require a holistic approach in creating awareness about not only on credit management but on financial products, education, debt counseling, savings and advice on money management. Significance of the Work: The research work addresses important aspects like financial awareness, education, debt counseling, etcwhich can contribute to attain our goal of financial inclusion.

AB  - This study analysed the level of financial literacy among university students in Estonia, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation and Turkey. The purpose of the study was to determine the level of financial literacy among university students, and to find out the relationship between financial knowledge and demographic characteristics of students. Online survey instrument was used to collect data. 409 fully completed questionnaires were accepted for analysis. Logistic regression was used to analyse of impact of the demographic characteristics on financial literacy. Overall mean of correct answers for the survey was 72.2%. This result represents a medium level of financial literacy about personal finance. Results indicate that male students, business major students, PhD students, those who live in a rental house, those whose parents have high level income, those who get advice on financial matters from their friends, those who took financial course before, those who get financial information about financial issues from university education, and students from Poland are more knowledgeable on personal finance. More financial courses should be provided in university education programmes, which could help more students handle their finances better and improve their financial wellbeing. It should be taken into consideration that in recent years, environmental and technological influences on financial literacy may be more important than parental influence. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - This paper examines the effect of audit committee appointments on shareholder wealth in Korea after the Asian financial crisis. We find that stock prices generally increase with audit committee appointments. In contrast, chaebol (business group) affiliates and firms switching audit committee membership are associated with significantly lower stock returns, probably due to the management's opportunistic behavior. However, the independence and financial literacy of the audit committee members appear to mitigate the opportunistic behavior. Therefore, our result confirms that the characteristics of the audit committee strengthen or weaken the existing corporate governance. We discuss the implications of our results obtained under Korea's unique corporate governance structure. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to measure the relationship between developing entrepreneurial leaders and their successful performance in business simulation. At Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), learners do Strategic Management and business simulation courses during the third year of their Bachelor's degree. By the time they do the business simulation course, they will already have taken at least one or two courses in each of marketing, management, accounting, business statistics, international business, finance and innovation and entrepreneurship. These students already have an introductory exposure to the main concepts that comprise the business core. Theoretically, they are ready to test their knowledge, understanding and skills at the applied learning level. Thus business simulation is seen as a capstone course for the business-core courses. For this study, comparative performance metrics in the student group project, student self-reflective statements, overall placement in the simulation game and total shareholder return of a simulated mobile phone company are matched to the data visualisation graphics. Data visualisation is enabled by KH Coder, an unsupervised machine learning, quantitative text-analysis process. Technologies used in the analysis include correlation co-occurrence networks, centrality co-occurrence networks and multidimensional scaling. A linkage is struck between high performance in the business simulation course via a set of metrics and the visual content of the graphics, representing students' understanding of the simulation. The high performing teams in the simulation-those who best modelled overall competitive and financial success in the game-exhibited a unique pattern of understanding. Using a pattern-matching approach, a clear data structure emerges that separates high-performing teams from their competitors. This study documents success via modelling innovation and entrepreneurship through participation in strategic management and business simulation courses. The results highlight the importance of learner participation in overall innovation and entrepreneurship education, and the financial literacy gained from participating in business simulation. While business simulation is currently a hot topic, limited research is available from the Middle East connecting entrepreneurship and innovation to success in business simulation. This study takes a data analytics approach to demonstrate the value of participating in business simulation. There is a strong connection between performing well in business simulation and the unique pattern that emerges from the data analytics of the text of what students feel they have learned. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - Most of the property owners in developing countries particularly those residing in informal settlements do not have formal land ownership documents, which weakens security of tenure and denies them access to credit. In addressing the problem, various initiatives have been taken but some of them have not been very effective. This paper uses a case example of an upgraded informal settlement in Tanzania to assess acceptability of residential licences as quasi-land ownership documents among property owners and lending institutions. Findings show that security of tenure, access to credit, property value enhancement, land conflict resolution and guarantee for compensation are the main factors that attract property owners to apply for residential licences. On the other hand, short life span of residential licences, exposure to multiple taxation and land rent, complex application procedure and lack of knowledge on residential licence uses are the main factors accounting for low residential licence application. Findings also show that some property owners do not use residential licences as collateral due to low financial literacy and fear of losing property in case of loan default. Although findings also show that many banks accept residential licences as collateral, it is also clear that having a residential licence without owning a business or having a regular income stream is not enough for a property owner to qualify for a loan because lenders are more interested in borrowers’ ability to service the loan rather than mere possession of a land title or its equivalent. Knowledge of these factors is important in devising appropriate interventions that, apart from placing much emphasis on formal land ownership documents, take on board all key factors that hinder land owners from effectively utilising their land for capital and income generation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Compared with the developed countries such as Britain and America, China’s financial and business education started later without enough attention, especially in the economically backward central and western regions. With the further deepening of China’s reform and opening-up and economic development, the backward finance and business education and the unbalanced regional development are not in line with China’s economic and social development. Therefore, strengthening the financial and business education and further developing the human capital are the urgent tasks of China’s education reform and development, and the universal financial education has been raised to the national strategic level. With the application-oriented colleges and universities in the central region as the object of research, this paper uses the method of questionnaire to explore ways to improve the financial literacy of college students. © 2018 EDAM.

AB  - This paper provides insights into the level of financial inclusion after implementation of PMJDY at the district and village level, in terms of level of utilisation of Basic Savings Bank Deposit account, use of RuPay debit cards and incidence of zero balance in Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh. It also describes the functioning of Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs) and issues/challenges faced in the process of implementation of the Scheme. Overall, it may be said that PMJDY has served the purpose of financial inclusion to a great extent as it has ensured opening of bank accounts of all the households in the study area. However, concerted efforts are needed to address the issues relating to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in banks, Business Correspondents (BCs) and Financial Literacy Centers (FLCs) so that the tempo gained thus far is sustained and the goal of comprehensive financial inclusion is reached in near future. © 2019 National Institute of Rural Development.

AB  - Using a multilevel analysis with data from PISA 2012, we find that the differences in financial literacy of 15-year-old students are explained by both individual and school characteristics. This paper finds that the financial education is positively related to students’ financial literacy scores when it is taught as a cross-curricular subject and as part of business or economics courses, and to a lesser extent as part of mathematics and as an extracurricular activity. Also, math and reading abilities, and holding a bank account and a prepaid debit card, contribute positively to the development of financial literacy, while financial unfamiliarity contributes negatively. © 2018 Mohr Siebeck.

AB  - This article considers banking sector development, which is connected with the improvement of doing banking business through the use of Internet technology. The problem of introducing and developing modern banking technologies in the Russian Federation is very topical. The paper points to a number of advantages when introducing banking computerized systems and the most common ways of on-line payments and client identification in Russia. The structure of accounts with remote access that are opened by individuals and legal entities with Russian credit organizations are analyzed. Some measures to develop Internet technologies markets are proposed. A new method is Internet banking or telebanking, which allows expanding bank's customer base, to reduce business expenses and provide structure innovatization of economic development of the real and financial sectors of the Russian economy. Modernization will become a key expenditure item for the banks in the future. There are also considers improving the legal framework, development of the insurance system, implementation of an integrated approach to risk management, institutional changes in the activities of credit institutions, improving the financial literacy of the population and increasing citizens' skills in managing personal finances.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate success factors pertinent to the management of Indigenous businesses through the identification of points of intervention at the systemic and structural levels. Through this approach, the economic and social values that First Nations communities attach to intangible Indigenous cultural heritage (ICH) and Indigenous cultural intellectual property (ICIP) may be both recognised and realised as assets. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a multidisciplinary approach to address a global issue of economic and social significance to First Nation peoples, their businesses and the Australian Aboriginal communities. The authors adopt a First Nation epistemological standpoint that incorporates theoretical perspectives drawn from a diverse range of fields and theories (Preston, 2013), as well as advocate the use of Indigenist methodology for research with First Nation peoples as it is underpinned by critical race theory. Findings: The authors argue conceptually that accounting, accountability and auditing consideration are required to fully identify what is impacting the successful management of Indigenous enterprises. Specifically, in relation to accounting, Elders should be included to assist in valuing the intangible ICH and ICIP assets. Furthermore, the authors emphasise the need to improve the financial and commercial literacy levels of Indigenous entrepreneurs. Practical implications: The authors prescribe the use of tools for the accounting treatment of ICH and ICIP as intangible assets within an Australian regulatory environment and define an auditing process and accountability model incorporating cultural, social and environmental measures. A central tenet of this model relates to improving levels of personal and commercial financial literacy in the First Nation participants. Collectively, these factors promote informed participation and decision-making, and may promulgate more sustainable outcomes. Social implications: Integrated thinking requires all these factors to be considered in a holistic manner, such that a First Nation enterprise and the wider Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can understand, and make decisions based on, the overall impact it has on all their stakeholders and generally on the society, the environment and the economy. Originality/value: This paper contributes to Australia’s strategic research priorities of maximising social and economic participation in society and improving the health and well-being of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The authors address the inability of current Western accounting standards, practices and models to suitably account for communally held and protocol-bound intangible Indigenous cultural heritage and Indigenous cultural intellectual property assets. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The study aims at assessing the gap in knowledge, perception and practice of managing personal finance among undergraduate students in India. A combined measure of self-rating and actual financial knowledge and practice on credit cards, investments, loans and insurance are recorded to analyze the behavioral gap. A structured questionnaire was administered on 1500 undergraduate students, selected using a purposive sampling technique. Simultaneous study on 50 experts to record their opinion and experience in identifying teachable opportunities, gaps in the current system and the best methodology for imparting financial literacy program for non-finance students revealed the best practices. The best practices suggested are evaluated based on its capacity to target, interact, access, scalable and its effectiveness at university level. It is evident from the study that there is a larger lacuna in imparting the basic financial knowledge for practical management of personal finance to non-business students and the teachable opportunities are unidentified at university level. © 2015, (Publisher).

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a case study of a service learning project focusing on financial literacy. In response to the global financial crisis there has been increasing emphasis on improving financial literacy skills and education. In this paper, the author argues for service learning as a means of integrating the finance curricula with real-world applications. Design/methodology/approach - Initially, the author surveys the growing importance of a financial literacy education as well as integrating service learning with a business education. The author then describes the implementation of a service-learning program at a private university that provides financial literacy workshops to community partners. Findings - The paper concludes with a discussion of the effectiveness of the financial literacy workshops and reflections of the service-learning experience. Research limitations/implications - It is an opportunity for learning among culturally diverse groups and has also helped international students become more culturally involved on campus. Practical implications - The undergraduate service-learning program is placed in an intermediate finance class. It is also an opportunity for cultural and financial institutional learning among international students. Social implications - Given the diversity of community service partners in this project, the service-learning experience has become an opportunity to teach all students on international cultural differences and social justice themes. Originality/value - This is one of the few pedagogical examples in financial literacy with an international dimension. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 2046-469X.

AB  - Financial literacy is the ability to understand how money works in a person's day-to-day life: how someone earns money, manages it, invests it, and donates it to help others. As librarians, we must realize that when patrons come to us for guidance in the area of financial literacy, they are trusting us to provide not only reliable information for their finances, but also, in many cases, information that may well keep a roof over their head and food on the table. At the same time, with the continuing escalation of database prices, especially in the area of business and finance, libraries are having to make increasingly difficult decisions as to what to retain and what to discontinue. The case studies and the works cited in this paper are presented to enable librarians to educate themselves about resources in financial literacy to better serve patrons using freely available resources that are accurate and timely. © 2015 Peter L.

AB  - The financial sectors with their various derivative products have become important media in supporting economic and social activities. This condition was growing more conducive by rapid development of information technology, so that financial access can reach various groups of people. Financial inclusion has become the government’s program which was aimed to encourage the financial system which can be accessed by all segments of society, so they were expected to boost the economic growth and to overcome the poverty. Jember and Bondowoso regency that play as the barometer of the regional economic growth in East Java make financial inclusion program as the development priority. This study was aimed to describe of society’s financial inclusion in Bondowoso and Jember Regency; and indentify the determinant of society’s financial inclusion in Bondowoso and Jember Regency which was used quantitative descriptive from existing and tabulation data through interviews and logit model. The results of the analysis showed that the aggregate level of financial inclusion in Bondowoso and Jember was good enough which was indicated by the availability of sufficient number of banking institutions with financial service facilities. But some people still find some difficulties in reaching financial due to low financial literacy levels and the limited information from the public, it was caused by the fears toward other individual financial service providers. The society’s access to financial credit facility especially business loans was quite high and becomes potential indication in developing the real sector. © International Economic Society.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between commercial bank lending terms, financial literacy and access to formal credit by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach: In this cross-sectional study, the authors surveyed 384 business owners or managers of SMEs in Uganda. The authors applied confirmatory factor analysis to reduce the number of factors and identify the important elements that capture commercial lending terms, financial literacy and access to formal credit. The authors put forward and tested two hypotheses relating to the significance of the relationship between perceived commercial bank lending terms, financial literacy and access to formal credit using structural equation modelling with analysis of moment structures 18. Findings: The results suggest a positive and significant relationship between perceived commercial bank lending terms, financial literacy and access to formal credit. Moreover, the ANOVA results serendipitously show that access to formal credit varies with type of business and turnover. However, collateral and loan repayment periods are not observed variables for commercial bank lending terms. The most significant observed variable for commercial bank lending terms is interest rates. This, together with financial literacy, explains 31 per cent of the variances in access to formal credit by SMEs in Uganda. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited to the SME firms registered and operating in Kampala, Uganda and it is possible that the results are only applicable to these firms in Uganda. Nevertheless, the findings have implications to commercial banks wishing to improve the turnover of their micro-lending schemes. Practical implications: Efforts by the stakeholders to improve financial literacy of SMEs owners and managers must be matched with favourable interest rates if access to formal credit is to be enhanced. Social implications: The findings also have implications for governments aiming at improving access to finance to overcome income inequality problems, and also improve their growth.Originality/value: The results provide initial evidence of the aggregate explanatory power of interest rates and financial literacy for the criterion variable, access to formal credit by SMEs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Despite its promise as a powerful tool for alleviating poverty, research suggests that microfinance has had only a modest impact on development. Misallocation of funds by clients has been implicated as a major impediment to microfinance success. In this study, clients received training on how to track (but not manage) their cash flows during the first two meetings of the microfinance loan cycle. Examination of weekly cash flow shows that clients immediately invested the majority of their funds into the businesses and carefully managed revenues and expenditures to maintain sufficient food and other household expenditures throughout the loan cycle. It is not possible to know whether this behaviour occurred as a result of monitoring cash flow because clients who do not keep cash flow records do not have a reliable way to report expenditures. However, exit interviews provide evidence that cash flow tracking enhanced financial performance and control. When asked whether tracking cash flows affected their understanding and behaviour, half or more of the subjects responded that tracking their cash flow helped them to understand the importance of investing in the business, identify unnecessary expenditures and/or develop a better understanding of their revenues, expenses and profit. By investing a small amount of time in helping clients track cash flows, lenders can empower clients and potentially improve both the repayment and productive benefits of the loans they make.

AB  - Rural women have long found entrepreneurial opportunities by way of associating with Self Help Groups. Although the numbers are quite meagre, women are increasingly being driven to take up small business activities for economic upliftment. The support of the State machinery by way of social welfare schemes has been crucial in this regard as right from the formation of the group to sanctioning of credit facilities from public sector banks. However, much of this is on papers and appears in various government reports. The activities undertaken by these women have been in sectors like traditional horticulture processing, dairy, handicraft etc. While they understand the core activity undertaken by them, their banking literacy and access to credit facilities required to run the business has been a cause of concern. This study through a survey conducted across 200 women SHG members across 4 districts in Uttarakhand aims to explore the three key areas-levels of bank credit literacy among SHG women i.e., how well they understand the basic modalities of a bank loan and more so about the loans taken by them, accessibility-how easier is it to avail bank credit at rural public sector bank branches and the quality of service-whether they are satisfied with the service of their financing bank. The study reveals that while NGOs have played a great role in linking rural women to banks and inculcating banking habits, financial literacy regarding credit facilities still remain a concern. In the SHG mode, most of the members are aware about the financing schemes launched by the Government through Bank, NGOs and government officials. However, they are still not confident of dealing independently with banks for credit facility. Majority of the members do not have information regarding defaults in loan payments, financial position of the group's business and subsidy amount receivable in their loan accounts or even the repayment period of the loan. Service quality of banks have been judged as satisfactory by far perhaps due to the fact that most of the time they visit the banks with NGO representatives. This study brings out the target areas for better financial awareness among rural micro entrepreneurs so that they can manage businesses more effectively. © 2018, Allied Business Academies.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the determinants of owner manager financial self-confidence. In particular, it estimates the effect of bank credit rejection and financial education (FE) on the financial self-confidence of business owners. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses data from 2004 and 2008 surveys of 2,500 UK small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). An ordered probit estimation is used to measure and assess the effect of bank credit rejection and FE variables on financial self-confidence for the two periods. The authors also explore potential differences in self-confidence between males and females. Findings: The results show that outright bank credit rejection reduces financial self-confidence among owner managers whereas partial bank credit rejection is found to help boost confidence prior to the financial crisis. There is strong evidence that FE increases financial self-confidence. Finally, the authors find no association between gender and reported self-confidence in finance. Research limitations/implications: Entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs are encouraged to explore financial literacy and knowledge with a view to increasing their financial self-confidence. This will help SMEs to deal with the banks or other finance providers more efficiently. In addition, better application procedures and information on lending criteria may help SMEs to minimize the probability of bank credit rejection. So the current study has implications for professional bodies as well. The study, however, is restricted to sole proprietor and partnership SMEs and in the UK context only. Practical implications: Financial self-confidence has a progressive effect on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial venture growth. The financial self-confidence of owner managers can support their entrepreneurial capability in starting and operating one or more businesses. As entrepreneurs successfully start and operate their own businesses, they are contributing to economic development through job creation, employment and tax contribution. Originality/value: This paper makes an original contribution in highlighting the usefulness of FE in boosting financial self-confidence among entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs. It is also found that the experience of bank credit rejection reduces entrepreneurs’ financial self-confidence. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

This article demonstrates how the author, a business and economics librarian, led the way at her institution to bring financial literacy to the campus by participating in the national Money Smart Week (MSW) program sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. She formed a planning committee that included individuals from several campus units. This team organized, planned, and delivered 11 events during MSW. The author also discusses survey results and the instrument that was used to gather data from MSW attendees. © 2015, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Research on the influence of financial literacy on MSMEs business growth has been carried out. However, creative MSMEs financial literacy related to understanding accounting and budgeting is rarely valued. This study focuses on assessing the effect of financial literacy in particular an understanding of debt management, budgeting, bank services, and accounting for the growth of Creative MSMEs. Creative MSMEs in Yogyakarta are chosen because Yogyakarta is a region that is rich in traditional culture and diverse character of its inhabitants, thus encouraging the development of the potential of Creative MSMEs. Research uses primary data sources on Creative MSMEs in Yogyakarta. Data collection is done through an independent questionnaire. The technique of analyzing multiple linear regression data is used to test the effect of financial literacy on business growth. The results of the study found that financial literacy influenced business growth. The research implications are Creative MSMEs who have a good understanding of financial literacy can make the right decisions so that their business growth increases. Good financial literacy encourages Creative MSMEs to be able to optimally absorb various programs and incentives from the government and accountable them accountably. This research also provides insight to stakeholders who have a role to increase financial literacy in Indonesia. © 2019, Faculty of Engineering, University of Kragujevac. All rights reserved.

AB  - The need for making optimal financial decisions is very important in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) especially as most SMEs are always financially constrained. Consequently, there has been an increasing interest from researchers to determine how well financial literacy skills can enable entrepreneurs to make decisions that result in optimal financial outcomes and possible enhance the performance and growth of their businesses. This study had as objectives to find out the impact of financial literacy on firm performance, as well as to examine the moderating effect of financial capital availability on the financial literacy - performance relationship, amongst SME in the Free State province of South Africa. The results showed that on average SME have low levels of financial literacy and financial capital availability. It was also observed that financial literacy positively influenced SME performance, and that the relationship is positively moderated by financial capital availability. It is, therefore, necessary for SME owners to develop financial literacy skills as an essential part of entrepreneurial activities. Likewise, since businesses rely on financial capital to invest, develop and grow, policy makers should put in place measures on how to bridge the access to finance gap, and, thus, ensure that entrepreneurs are relieved from financing constraints. © Neneh Brownhilder Ngek, 2016.

AB  - The article investigates the importance of financial literacy content for social work students who at some point in their career will encounter financially-excluded clients. Financial literacy content can include understanding how fringe economy businesses operate, including their business model, knowledge of local and national nonpredatory financial services, understanding credit and the credit industry, and knowledge of state and national regulations governing high-cost financial services. This article also examines the financial literacy gap in social work education and provides an overview of some key fringe economy enterprises, such as payday lenders, car title pawns, pawnshops, rent-to-own businesses, buy-here-pay-here used car lots, and debit/credit cards. Last, the article explores ways to integrate financial literacy training with traditional social work skills. © Council on Social Work Education.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the impact of financial experience on financial literacy. Exploiting a unique feature of New Zealand, whereby domestic students can obtain interest-free student loans and can fully participate in the national retirement scheme while international students cannot, we employ an instrumental variables approach to identify the causal effect of financial experience on financial literacy. We conduct surveys on a sample of 338 business students and find that there is a positive and causal effect of financial experience on financial literacy. Our results have important implications for financial education programmes and may explain why many of these programmes to date have had limited success. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

AB  - We use data from a Dutch data set, the DNB Household Survey, annually covering the period 1996–2015, to study the relationship between informal parental saving education received when people were children or adolescents and two variables aimed to capture adult individuals’ concerns for their future: planning horizon and future orientation. Our results indicate that the general future orientation positively correlates with informal saving education, and in particular having received financial teachings. Our findings also suggest that the future orientation index is rather stable over time (which is not trivial, especially because our dataset covers two full business cycles) and declines with age following the life-cycle. © 2019 Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education®.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between financial literacy and business performance improvement of MSMEs in East Java Province. Data collection from a survey questionnaire of 399 respondents was used to examine the research model. Then, the research model was analysed primarily using logistic regression supported by SPSS V.20 Software. The results of the study show that bookkeeping literacy and budgeting literacy has been proven as the significant predictor of sales growth, profit growth and overall business performance of MSMEs. However, control variables such as gender, education, and experience do not give any critical role in the relationship between financial literacy and business performance improvement of MSMEs. Theoretically, this study proposed that increasing the level of financial literacy for MSMEs managers related to bookkeeping and budgeting skills can enhance the business performance of MSMEs. Practically, the results of the study can be used as a reference for increasing the level of financial literacy for MSMEs managers who are still low in Indonesia. It is suggested to develop well-structured regular training for MSMEs managers regarding bookkeeping and budgeting skills in improving the level of financial literacy and business performance simultaneously. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Financial inclusion has been accorded high importance by the Gol and RBI to aid the inclusive growth process of the economy, but the impact of these have not yielded agreeable results. There have been formidable challenges in this area such as bringing sections of society that are financially excluded within the ambit of the formal financial system, providing financial literacy, and strengthening credit delivery mechanisms. As the majority of the rural population is still not included in inclusive growth, the concept of financial inclusion is a challenge for the Indian economy. The present study made an attempt to study the effectiveness of the existing resources such as network of bank branches, business correspondents (BCs), basic savings bank deposit accounts with overdraft facility, financial literacy, and credit counselling, credit guarantee fund, micro insurance, unorganised sector pension schemes, payment banks, post offices, and fair price shops network, information technology, banking technologies, PMJDY, and MUDRA Yojana, etc., towards financial inclusion. The study found that there is a still lacuna which needs to be covered, thereby making financial inclusion more efficient and user-friendly for the financially untouchable rural population.

AB  - The financial literacy of today’s students is essential to their future success. Colleges and universities struggle to develop methods for training students in financial literacy. This study investigates the financial literacy of college students, looking at individual factors of financial background, race, gender, major and motivation in order to understand if students are learning enough to be considered financially literate, and how to structure a course in order to improve overall literacy. Findings demonstrate a lack of financial literacy among students who aren’t business majors, haven’t been exposed to previous financial courses, and lack overall confidence in their financial literacy. © 2019, North American Business Press.

AB  - Macroeconomic and non-macroeconomic factors are considered important in measuring market volatility; therefore, cannot be ignored, and the level of impact of these factors needs be determined in different economies. This study considered the impact of non-macroeconomic factors that drive stock market volatility in a developing economy using Nigeria annual stock data from 1985 to 2016. In order to achieve the objective, sets in this study, vector error correction model (VECM) is adopted. The impulse response function (RF) and the variance decomposition were used to determine the component of the VECM. Based on the VECM, a long run relationship was established between stock market volatility and non-macroeconomic variables considered. The empirical analysis revealed that gross domestic product, interest rate and the number of listed firms were found to decline in response to positive shock on stock market price volatility. The study recommended financial literacy of investors as it has the potential of boosting investment in the stock market. Investors are also encouraged to get their business listed on the stock exchange to improve diversification and stability in the stock market. © 2018, ASERS Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop and test through an experiment, an innovative online video teaching module that significantly improves financial literacy in college of business students. Specific business major financial literacy levels are also tested. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 244 college of business students were given a financial literacy test. Half of the students were exposed to the “treatment” (watched a video module), while other half were not. The videos comprised 67 min of micro-lectures that students could download, free of charge, at their own convenience. The researchers analyzed the impact of a previous personal finance course on students’ financial literacy levels and tested across four business majors. Findings: The video intervention was the most successful at increasing financial literacy, surprisingly more so than having taken a past personal finance course. Interaction effects were not significant. Four college majors were tested with a shorter, improved financial literacy measure – finding, to our surprise that non-quantitative business majors (particularly marketing students) are not less financially literate than other majors. Supporting past research, the authors found that female and African-American college students performed significantly lower on the test. Originality/value: The research adds value to the literature by developing and testing a modern, novel teaching innovation to improve financial literacy in young adults. Using an experimental setting, the authors showed that the innovation was more effective than the commonly proscribed personal finance course. This is one of the few studies to measure financial literacy levels for specific college of business majors. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: The feminisation of ageing and increasing number of widowed women in contemporary society has significant implications. Older women are at risk of poor health, social, and economic outcomes upon widowhood. The aim of the study was to describe women's experiences in the period soon after their husbands' death, including their financial issues and concerns, and the ways in which these experiences impacted on the transition to widowhood late in life. Methods: This was a longitudinal study using serial in-depth semi-structured interviews with 21 community-dwelling women over the age of 65 in Australia. Verbatim transcripts underwent Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Results: Thematic analysis revealed: 1) administrative burden increases vulnerability; 2) gender roles impact on transitions; and 3) financial adjustments render housing insecurity and health risk. High administrative burden within the context of significant grief and mourning was a defining feature of the early bereavement period. Complicated protracted administrative processes, insensitive interactions, and reminders of loss contributed to distress, anxiety and feelings of demoralisation. Several women identified assumption of household financial management as the most difficult aspect of coping with their husband's death. Conclusions: Older women may have unmet needs for assistance with administrative, financial, and legal issues immediately following spousal death and potentially for years afterward. Lack of familiarity and absence of instrumental support with financial and legal issues signal the need for policy reform, resources to improve financial literacy in women throughout the life course, increased advocacy, and consideration of different support and service models. © DiGiacomo et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - This paper discusses the issues of improving the financial literacy of crisis managers. In a market economy, small and medium-sized enterprises are faced with constant changes that can lead enterprises to liquidation. Companies use crisis management to solve immediate problems in a crisis period. The formation of the financial literacy of a crisis manager will contribute to the growth of the effectiveness of its activities. The relevance of the topic of crisis management in small business is due to the presence of problems with profit-making by small entrepreneurs due to the opening of large store chains, even in small towns. Our state needs to take into account all segments of the population, those who can buy products in large chain stores, as well as those who can only come to a store that is nearby and buy the most necessary things for the near future. That is why small business should exist along with big business and also successfully extract the maximum profit from its activities. The purpose of this work is to study the development of crisis management in small businesses, in particular, its application in practice in Russia. © 2019, Research Trend. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial literacy, access to finance and growth among small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) within the Midlands region of the UK. It assesses whether financial literacy assists SMEs to overcome information asymmetry, mitigates the need for collateral, optimizes capital structure and improves access to finance. Design/methodology/approach: To gain a deeper insight into the complex relationship between financial literacy, access to finance and growth, a qualitative research is carried out among SMEs that have operated for over five years or longer. Using the purposive sampling technique, 37 firms were selected based on size, location and characteristics, mainly from the city of Birmingham and the joining conurbations. Open-ended and a combination of dichotomous questions were used for the survey. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analyzed. Findings: Financial literacy is an interconnecting resource that mitigates information asymmetry and collateral deficit when evaluating loan applications, therefore financial literacy should be part of school curriculum. The analysis suggests enhanced financial literacy, reduces monitoring cost and serves to optimize firms’ capital structure that positively impacts on SMEs growth. Financial management knowledge is recognized as the core resource that aids an effective decision making by owners of SMEs. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this research is the small sample that limits its generalization. Its findings could be enhanced by a larger sample and by conducting comparative studies in other regions or economies. SMEs growth is seen as a strategic policy to stimulate enterprise but the finance gap tends to constrain that objective. The UK Government’s effort to improve access to finance and to mitigate excessive collateral demands by lenders has proved elusive. This empirical research provides evidence that financial literacy enhances access to finance and, in turn, promotes growth potentials. Practical implications: The results of this study advocate the provision of financial literacy at schools and target support for SMEs to acquire financial management skills in order to mitigate information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers. Social implications: Findings suggest that financial literacy mediates access to finance, enables enterprises to use optimal financial structure to mitigate business failure, creates employment and reduces public sector support for social benefits. Originality/value: This study is novel in that it examines financial literacy and its implications for access to finance and firm growth in the UK. The study is an effort to highlight the role of financial information in mitigating barriers to finance for SMEs. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Teachers of business and economic journalism are developing creative approaches to attracting students and educating them in a field many find daunting. To recruit, some avoid using the terms business or economic in course titles, preferring financial basics and financial literacy. Many use novel classroom techniques: to educate students about stock markets, for instance, some set up competitions where students vie to develop the most profitable portfolio. Provocative videos, cleverly developed assignments and trips to business-news sites are highlights in some courses. This article reviews approaches by a broad array of teachers. © AEJMC 2015.

AB  - We examined the construct of financial wellness and its relationship to personal wellbeing, with a focus on the role of financial literacy. Gender comparisons are made using a structural equation modeling analysis including personal wellbeing, financial satisfaction, financial status, financial behavior, financial attitude, and financial knowledge. Males ranked higher in financial satisfaction and financial knowledge whereas females ranked higher in personal wellbeing. Joo's (2008) concept of financial wellness as multidimensional is supported though the result is improved when a causal model of sub-components is estimated. The relationship of all variables to personal wellbeing is mediated by financial satisfaction, with gender differences: In females the main source of financial satisfaction is financial status whereas in males it is financial knowledge. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Purpose: Emerging evidence correlates increased physician leadership effectiveness with improved patient and healthcare system outcomes. To maximize this benefit, it is critical to understand current physician leadership needs. The purpose of this study is to understand, through physicians’ self-reporting, their own and others’ most effective and weakest leadership skills in relation to the LEADS leadership capabilities framework. Design/methodology/approach: The authors surveyed 209 Canadian physician leaders about their perceptions of their own and other physicians’ leadership abilities. Thematic analysis was used, and the results were coded deductively into the five LEADS categories, and new categories emerging from inductive coding were added. Findings: The authors found that leaders need more skills in the areas of Engage Others and Lead Self, and an emergent category of Business Skills, which includes financial competency, budgeting, facilitation, etc. Further, Achieve Results, Develop Coalitions and Systems Transformation are skills least reported as needed in both self and others. Originality/value: The authors conclude that LEADS, in its current form, has a gap in the competencies prescribed, namely, “Business Skills”. They recommend the development of a more comprehensive LEADS framework that includes such skills as financial literacy/competency, budgeting, facilitation, etc. The authors also found that certain dimensions of LEADS are being overlooked by physicians in terms of importance (Systems Transformation, Achieve Results, Develop Coalitions), and this warrants greater investigation into the reasons why these skills are not as important as the others (Engage Others and Lead Self). © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The three-legged stool concept is widely used in gerontological and geriatric education as an explanation on how one should fiscally approach his or her retirement. Financial managers, planners, retirees, business owners, even the Social Security Administration uses this metaphor of fiscal soundness in retirement planning. Gerontologists are moving away from the “tripod of retirement income” and “three-legged stool” term, as more often market work is needed for financial security. This activity focuses on the tripod or three-legged stool concepts of retirement planning using active learning, allowing the students to work collaboratively in a group, reflect upon the activity, and most importantly have fun. The game also allows for an expansion of the tripod concepts into the four pillars of economic security, broaching the use of personal assets and the possible need for longer employment. Game scenarios also emphasize macro- and microlevel forces, such as race, gender, health status, education, or marital status, which can influence timing of retirement or the level of retirement income available. The authors include instructions on how to set up the learning experience including worksheets, as well as reflection questions posed throughout the process. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Interactive nature of business modeling gives ample opportunities to managers and government employees to purchase and develop their initial skills and organizing knowledge, such as creation of strategy, solving the tactical and operational targets. Simulators include learning to do everything that can only be studied in practice where mistakes really stand. The simulator will allow "to study at practice" for finding of optimal solutions and will show the direction as the decision shall be applied. We created the simulator for a financial analysis. At the simulator it is several benefits: • The reliable zone-a mistake in won't lead to economy crash; • Increase in scale-an opportunity to take various positions in a management system; • Improvement of financial literacy-acquisition of new knowledge in an innovative format; • Team work-strengthening of communication and cooperation in team. Besides, use of the simulator became an objective necessity of our time as educational methods which generally depend on a lecture format, effective for development of the informative skills necessary in study of students. This method will be corresponding not only on practices, but also and for the main students and will increase practical results of educational activities and aspiration of increase in scientific research.

AB  - The article considers widespread types of nonstandard employment among the rural population and main problems associated with their development in border area based on the analysis of statistical and sociological data on rural employment of the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. It is revealed that the processes of development of nonstandard forms of employment in the oblast in modern conditions are in its infancy and this situation will continue if conditions remain the same. Currently, the population of rural areas of the region prefers jobs (at agricultural and nonagricultural enterprises) even without official employment, which corresponds to Russian trends. Preference is given to employment with foreign farmers. The overwhelming majority of the population does not see any prospects for developing their own businesses in rural areas; optimistic residents prefer to engage in small-scale trade. The rural population is not ready to use manufacturing decorative and applied products as an additional source of income. Low financial literacy, lack of material resources, and difficult socioeconomic situation in the oblast restrain the active population from developing their own businesses. © 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Consumer financial literacy remains a subject of intensive discussion within academic, business, and governmental policymaking communities. This study considers learning outcomes associated with teaching basic financial literacy concepts to undergraduate accounting and business students enrolled in the principles of accounting sequence. The study was conducted at a small mid-western university utilizing a full-time, Master of Business Administration student to develop and deliver financial literacy training workshops to students enrolled in the target courses. This single source for training materials and pedagogical delivery removed any potentially confounding effects that would be associated with engaging more than one person. A statistical assessment of the pre-test and post-test outcomes was conducted within a matched-pair, repeated measures statistical evaluation framework. The findings suggest that a parsed approach to teaching financial literacy, as opposed to a single personal finance course, represents a potentially effective method for addressing the basic financial literacy needs of undergraduate accounting and business students. Further, these results suggest that it may be possible to expand the training model in a cost effective and efficient way so that financial literacy training could be provided in a reasonable manner to all undergraduate students regardless of their major area of study. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study addresses African-Americans’ retirement readiness and the factors that contribute to African Americans being prepared or not prepared for retirement. Specifically, this study explores the relationship between educated African-Americans’ financial literacy and their retirement readiness. To analyze this relationship, a binary logistic regression model was fitted to primary data collected from graduates, professors, and business professionals associated with a liberal arts university located in the southeastern USA. The researchers found that educated African-Americans who are more financially literate are more likely to be ready for retirement versus educated African-Americans who are less financially literate. This finding suggests that education does not equate to financial literacy. Moreover, millennials are more likely to be prepared for retirement compared to other age groups, and those who are single and those who do not work full time are less likely to be prepared for retirement. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The owners of small and medium-sized enterprises do usually not consider the financial management of their SMEs significant. This statement results from our survey. It is mainly underestimation of financial variables in business management and the low financial literacy of the owners, who are often managers at the same time. This study analyses the principles of the Financial Scoreboard/Mobley Matrix as rather considerable, yet, a user friendly tool by means of which the owners of SMEs and their managers can implement the principles of business intelligence in an efficient way. It is crucial to apply the principles of good financial management in a relatively short time period and target the company to higher efficiency and ability to adapt in a highly competitive environment. A healthy and long-term profit-making firm is not only the owner's target but also the objective of the whole society. From a macroeconomic perspective, SMEs represent 99.83% of the total number of enterprises in the Czech Republic and provide nearly 60% of employment. © 2019 Medwell Journals. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Small businesses play a crucial role in the Australian economy in terms of income and employment. Reliance on small business however can be concerning, as many small businesses fail to survive for a period of more than five years. This has been associated with the difficulty that small businesses face in maintaining a consistent cash flow. Research suggests that this may be related to financial and taxation literacy of the small business owner (SBO). Although SBOs have been identified has having a higher degree of financial literacy than individuals, it is unclear whether their level of literacy is adequate to support the management of the cash flow of their business. A continuing large research project investigates the required level of literacy that SBOs should possess to operate a successful business, with particular focus on cash flow management. This article reports expert perspectives of the degree of knowledge that is essential for SBOs in terms of professional financial literacy, computer accounting software (CAS) literacy and business taxation literacy in order to implement effective cash flow management practices. © 2018, Australasian Tax Teachers' Association.
