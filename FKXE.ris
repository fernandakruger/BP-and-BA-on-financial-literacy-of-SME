TI  - Financial Knowledge Matters Entrepreneurial Decisions: A Survey in the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB  - Knowledge, general and specific, plays a role in entrepreneurship. Little is known about the role of general knowledge in entrepreneurial intentions. This study fills the gap by proposing financial knowledge as general knowledge and entrepreneurial education as specific knowledge, and investigates their effects on entrepreneurial intentions and the three motivational factors including attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Using survey data of 480 undergraduates and the structural equation modeling approach, we find a significant impact of financial knowledge on entrepreneurial intentions and all three motivational factors. Entrepreneurial education does not have a significant direct impact but has an indirect effect on entrepreneurial intentions through attitude and perceived behavioral control. These results are important to educators and policymakers to design appropriate policies to improve financial knowledge due to its significant role in entrepreneurial decisions.

TI  - Bank customers complaints, financial knowledge and gender
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING-REVISTA ESPANOLA DE FINANCIACION Y CONTABILIDAD
AB  - This work aims to analyse the relationship between financial knowledge and the propensity of consumers to complain in the event of disagreement with a financial institution. A sample of 8,286 individuals from the Survey of Financial Competencies elaborated by the Bank of Spain is analysed. The results reveal that individuals with greater financial knowledge show a greater propensity to complain, presumably due to their heightened ability to detect possible fraud or abusive practices by financial entities. Gender itself is not relevant in the propensity to complain. However, when the sample is divided by gender, financial knowledge is more relevant for women than men. Additionally, the results reveal that in the female sample, propensity to complain is affected by self-confidence, in contrast to the male sample. The results suggest that the authorities should take practical steps to include financial knowledge in the educational curriculum.

TI  - Self-employment, gender, financial knowledge, and high-cost borrowing
T2  - JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Poor financial decisions are a primary cause of small firm failure. This research therefore reports on an examination of antecedents behind questionable financial borrowing practices among self-employed individuals. Poor financial decisions are proxied as the use of high-cost short-term payday loans, check-cashing services, and the like (collectively, alternative financial services, AFS). More than 20 percent of self-employed individuals in the United States reported having borrowed from AFS providers, a practice that is arguably symptomatic of the poor financial decisions that could lead to business failure. Self-employed individuals, particularly those with high levels of financial self-efficacy (an attribute important to entrepreneurship) are particularly likely to employ AFS borrowing. Overconfident individuals, including self-employed individuals, comprise a disproportionate fraction of AFS users. This work also found that financial knowledge among self-employed people is, on average, no higher than that among employees, and low financial knowledge is also associated with AFS usage. Women, even though generally less financially knowledgeable than men, are relatively less likely than men to use AFS borrowing.

TI  - Effect of financial knowledge on performance of women farm enterprises in Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRIBUSINESS IN DEVELOPING AND EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose Financial knowledge (FK) is considered one of the major factors influencing performance of farm enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of FK on performance of women farm enterprises. Performance is measured using levels of savings and enterprise margins. Design/methodology/approach The study uses primary data of 384 farmers from three sub-counties in Kericho County, Kenya. It employs a propensity score matching (PSM) approach to control for possible selection bias and to model the impact of FK on performance of women farm enterprises. Findings The analysis reveals that high FK has a significant positive impact on performance of women farm enterprises. Specifically, respondents with higher levels of FK were also associated with higher amounts of savings and enterprise margins. Originality/value The paper contributes to the growing debate on the role played by FK on performance of small and micro enterprises. It provides insights on the state of FK among women farmers and identifies knowledge gaps and policy implications from a developing country perspective.

TI  - How women CEOs' financial knowledge and firm homophily affect venture performance
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - We examine the impact of female-led venture firms' knowledge of alternative forms of financial capital and its effect on their financial performance as compared to male-led ventures. We contend that women chief executive officers (CEOs) leading such ventures faced unique historical and stereotypical challenges that impeded their financial knowledge and subsequent firm performance. We utilize liberal and social feminism frameworks, complemented with homophily theory to illustrate how female CEOs can overcome these challenges by increasing the percentage of women in the ownership structure of female-led venture firms.

TI  - Entrepreneurs on their financial literacy: evidence from the Netherlands
T2  - VENTURE CAPITAL
AB  - Using a representative survey of Dutch entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals, (i) we measure their subjective financial knowledge and the extent to which they ask for advice when managing their companies, and (ii) we examine whether subjective financial knowledge and the demand for advice are related to the firm economic performance. We find that the respondents feel more comfortable with accounting subjects than they do with strategic ones, of which they feel that they know the least. Entrepreneurs with a greater extent of financial knowledge are more likely to report a higher gross margin and higher revenue growth for their firm. These entrepreneurs are also less likely to seek advice and to delegate financial decisions. Seeking professional advice does not increase the likelihood of an entrepreneur having better performance. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs' degree of financial knowledge is related to the success of their businesses, while seeking advice is not significantly correlated with better firm performance.

Meanwhile, financial knowledge had some effects on entrepreneurial intention through entrepreneurial awareness. The empirical results emphasized the importance of the role of families and schools in building entrepreneurial awareness and intention.

TI  - Influence of Financial Literacy and Educational Skills on Entrepreneurial Intent: Empirical Evidence from Young Entrepreneurs of Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This paper attempts to study the impact of Financial Literacy on Youth Entrepreneurial Intent in Pakistan. A closed-ended self-administered structured questionnaire covering financial literacy, computer knowledge, financial attitude, and financial knowledge with Entrepreneurial Intent was collected from young entrepreneurs. The research tried to investigate the education level with computer skill to inspect the effect of financial literateness on young generation Entrepreneurial Intent in the context of Pakistan. The research model was tested using PLS-SEM and authenticating a measurement model through the advanced methodology and their association with Entrepreneurial Intent. Results revealed that financial literacy and its two parts (financial attitude and financial knowledge) have a positive impact on Entrepreneurial Intent. The size of the joint impact of financial literacy and its components on Entrepreneurial Intent was assessed to be adequate. Entrepreneurial Intent is essential for creating new firms to maintain economic development. Furthermore, it is determined in this research that if youth has better financial knowledge and financial attitude, the probability of Entrepreneurial Intent increases. This suggests that if the youth in Pakistan desire to attain a higher limit of Entrepreneurial Intent, they must implement financial literacy models for enhancing and promoting their current Entrepreneurial Intent.

TI  - Financial literacy environment scan in Mozambique
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - This research aims to scan financial literacy in Mozambique, assessing its levels and identifying the sociodemographic factors that influence it, generalizing to the developing countries. Quantitative research was performed using a survey database of 3,875 respondents collected in Mozambique. Our results document that more than 61% of the respondents did not answer correctly the questions regarding financial literacy, which indicates that the levels of financial literacy in Mozambique are low. Individuals are not qualified to make the most appropriate financial decisions and end up compromising their financial well-being. It was also found that age impacts respondents' financial knowledge, gender influences financial behavior, educational level influences financial knowledge and behavior, and the training area influences financial knowledge, attitude, and behavior. This article contributes by providing information regarding the financial literacy of Mozambique, which is still scarce and providing a sci-entific basis for decision-makers to improve public policies regarding financial literacy.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Advisors for micro-entrepreneurs: is one as good as another in accessing alternative finance?
T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - Using a novel large database of Italian micro-entrepreneurs, we investigate how different sources of external business advice affect access to alternative finance. We distinguish three categories of external business advice: professional financial, professional non-financial, and non-professional. We also test whether financial knowledge of micro-entrepreneurs enhances their advice seeking for financial decision-making. We find that the use of alternative financial instruments increases when external business advisors are used, but some are more useful than others. Only professional financial advice is shown to increase the probability of accessing alternative finance by micro-enterprises, while non-professional and professional non-financial advice does not have the same effect. We also find that being more financially literate increases the probability that micro-entrepreneurs seek advice from highly professional sources, i.e., objective financial knowledge helps shape the quality of financial advice requested.
   Do external business advisors help micro-entrepreneurs access alternative finance? Yes, they do. But only if they are professional financial advisors. Focusing on Italy, where 90-95% of all SMEs are micro-SME, as in the most of EU-27 Member States, our paper demonstrates that the source of advice matters to access alternative finance. We distinguish three categories of external business advice: professional financial (financial intermediaries and external financial consultants), professional non-financial (external accountants and public institutions), and non-professional (relatives, friends, and business partners). Only professional financial advisors increase the probability of using alternative financial instruments by micro-enterprises, while non-professional and professional non-financial advisors do not. This implies that micro-entrepreneurs, to diversify their sources of funding, should overcome their concerns related to the value and expense of specialized financial advisory services and improve their use. Moreover, our paper shows that being more financially literate increases the probability that micro-entrepreneurs seek advice from highly professional sources. From a policy perspective, this implies that governments should encourage and support the use of business professional financial advisors among micro-entrepreneurs, both directly by giving tax advantages to financial advisory services, and indirectly by strengthening financial education programs targeting micro-entrepreneurs.

TI  - Founder's Financial Knowledge and the New Firm's Ability to Obtain Debt Financing
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - How does a founder's knowledge of debt financing influence his/her new firm's ability to obtain the amount of debt financing it desires? Building on the cognitive psychology literature, we propose that the depth of a founder's debt financing knowledge is positively associated with the new firm's ability to obtain debt financing as he/she will be better at selecting and acquiring relevant sources of debt financing. Integrating insights on entrepreneurial growth-oriented strategies, we further argue that this relationship will be more pronounced when the new firm internationalizes and innovates more. Using a Heckman full information maximum likelihood model, we analyse survey data on 1845 Flemish new firms. The first stage of the model estimates the new firm's probability of raising debt financing. The second stage tests the relationship between the founder's knowledge depth of debt financing and the new firm's debt financing ability, conditional on the decision to raise debt financing. We find that the founder's knowledge depth of debt financing is positively associated with the new firm's ability to obtain debt financing. This association becomes even more pronounced when the new firm internationalizes more. These findings extend the entrepreneurial finance, entrepreneurial strategy and cognitive psychology literature.

The relationships between human capital, social capital, financial literacy and access to finance were analyzed using PLS-SEM.FindingsThe results show that human capital does influence access to finance but contrary to previous studies, the influence is negative. Financial literacy is an important element in the relationship between human capital, social capital and access to finance, although it plays a greater role in the relationship between social capital and access to finance. Further analysis shows that financial knowledge is significant in moderating the relationships between human and social capital with access to finance. Financial skills is found to only moderate the relationship between social capital and access to finance.Originality/valueTo the authors' knowledge, this study is the first that integrates the human capital, social capital, financial literacy and access to finance in a single model. The authors also highlight the importance of enhancing the financial literacy of MSMEs so that the problem of access to finance can be alleviated, especially in developing countries.

TI  - Analysis of extent of credit access among women farm-entrepreneurs based on membership in table banking (TB)
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Purpose Inadequate finance is considered a major factor limiting the growth of small-scale women-owned farm enterprises in Sub-Saharan Africa. Women empowerment programs such as table banking (TB) and women enterprise fund were initiated in an attempt to curb the credit gap affecting women in agribusiness. This paper determines the factors influencing the extent of credit access among women farm-entrepreneurs who are either members or nonmembers of TB groups in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted in Kericho County using a sample of 384 respondents. Factor analysis was used to generate three indicators of entrepreneurial orientation which were included as explanatory variables in the regressions. Double hurdle econometric model was employed to analyze the factors influencing the decisions on credit uptake and amount of borrowed loan. Separate models were estimated for members and nonmembers of TB groups since they differed in volume and source of loan accessed. Findings Results reveal that age of the woman and innovativeness negatively influenced credit access, whereas education level, participation in off-farm activities, number of farm enterprises, perception on interest rate, extension contacts and financial knowledge positively influenced the decision to access credit. On the other hand, participation in off-farm activities, risk-taking behavior, total land size, extension access and financial knowledge were statistically significant with positive correlation on the amount of loan borrowed. Significant factors differ between members and nonmembers of TB groups implying divergence in underlying credit access challenges once one has joined such groups. Research limitations/implications The study did not consider supply-side factors affecting the amount of loan accessed by women farm-entrepreneurs. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is one of the pioneer studies using the double hurdle model to analyze factors influencing the extent of credit access specifically among women farm-entrepreneurs and carrying out the analysis by membership in TB groups.

T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - This article presents the results of the financial literacy assessment of young Mexican students between the ages of 17 and 24 enrolled in public and private institutions in five Mexican cities. This study's objective was to approach the financial knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes of young Mexicans through focus groups and questionnaires to identify their perceptions of complex thinking and its use for financial products and services. The most relevant findings suggest that (a) most of the young participants in the study use banking services through their parents, (b) there are significant gender differences in financial knowledge and behaviors, (c) critical thinking significantly and positively correlates with financial behaviors and attitudes, and (d) the level of critical thinking predicts financial behavior. There is a need to develop women's critical thinking to discern between the financial behavior they socially imitate and their capabilities to become more involved in financial issues, thus decreasing the gender gap.

TI  - Does financial literacy drive entrepreneurship in rural China?
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Developing financial literacy is a crucial part of entrepreneurship. It can aid aspiring entrepreneurs to learn how to analyze market trends, formulate business plans, conduct cost accounting activities, and navigate fiscal risks in their businesses. Therefore, we investigated the most recent dataset on rural residents in China to determine the effects of financial literacy on their entrepreneurial behaviors. Our observations reveal that individuals with high financial literacy, that is, those who have attained advanced financial knowledge, are more likely to start a business than those with low financial literacy. We employed instrumental variable analysis to mitigate the endogeneity of financial literacy. Results show a causal relationship between Chinese rural residents' financial literacy and entrepreneurship. Finally, we demonstrate that the aggressive risk attitudes of rural families magnify the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurship.

TI  - The impact of entrepreneurial education on the propensity of business students to support new ventures: A moderated mediation model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This research aims to investigate the role of financial self-efficacy in mediating the relationship between entrepreneurial education and venture capital intention, as well as the moderating influence of government support on the relationship between financial self-efficacy and venture capital intention. The target population consists of Lahore students from public and private universities who have already studied entrepreneurship. Based on the 250 responses to the online survey the findings show the mediating role of financial self-efficacy between entrepreneurial education and intention toward venture capital. Moreover, it also indicates the moderated effect of government support on the relationship between financial self-efficacy and intention toward venture capital. This study will not only help the curriculum committees in business schools to design entrepreneurial education outlines that enable the students to explore the different financing modes by including financial knowledge to cope with financial challenges but also to the government officials in devising financing plans accompanied by their expertise in the development of a business.

TI  - Individual entrepreneurial behavior and financial literacy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - The technological revolution we have been witnessing over the last 30 years is bringing about important changes in business management, specifically in the conception, development, and management of its financial aspects. How to face these challenges is a particularly critical question for individual entrepreneurs who have to assume a much greater responsibility for decisions than in other corporate environments. In this sense, it is very important to understand the financial capabilities and skills and their limitations of this type of entrepreneurship, which is so important for the renewal and extension of the business community in any developed economy. Based on an extensive official survey of this type of entrepreneurship, this research proposes a logistic regression modeling, in order to find out the level of financial knowledge of this business group. One of the findings of this research is that individual entrepreneurs have a higher level of financial knowledge than salaried workers, with a higher qualification in this respect in the case of individual entrepreneurs with employees. This study analyses the link between individual entrepreneurs or self-employed workers - with or without employees - and financial literacy. In addition, we investigated the relationship between this group with their socio-demographic characteristics, financial product holdings, financial planning, and financial fragility. Different binary logistic regression models with maximum likelihood were estimated using a sample of individual entrepreneurs and self-employed workers from the Survey of Financial Competences database conducted in Spain to achieve this. The results of the study show that individuals who choose to be individual entrepreneurs or self-employed, and in particular those with hired workers, had a higher level of financial literacy than salaried workers. Moreover, it was confirmed that financial literacy complements the explanatory power of the other variables analyzed with respect to sole proprietors without employees, although not to a significant degree. The limitations of this work are due to the use of data from the Financial Skills Survey, so some dichotomous variables offer very generic information. In addition, the database is cross-sectional and we cannot analyze variations between different periods. No research before had applied the relationships between the behavior of individual entrepreneurs, with and without employees, and financial competencies using logistic functions and on the basis of a rigorous and comprehensive formal questionnaire. The conclusions provide a valuable perspective for developing training programs for this type of human capital aimed at raising the financial skills of individual entrepreneurs to improve personal and business management.

TI  - The interconnectivity between Islamic financial literacy and financial sustainability: evidence from Muslim micro-entrepreneurs in Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeFinancial illiteracy could pose a significant challenge to micro-entrepreneurs. There is a pressing need to foster financial literacy;, therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine particularly how Islamic financial literacy may enhance their businesses toward achieving financial sustainability.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses quantitative methods. Three hundred (300) questionnaires were distributed to micro-entrepreneurs in three states in Malaysia, namely, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu. This study used the partial least squares (PLS) analysis using the SmartPLS 3.2.FindingsThe study found that the most robust Islamic financial literacy factors are financial behavior, followed by financial knowledge and financial attitude .The outcome of Islamic financial literacy, which is financial sustainability, also demonstrates a positive and significant relationship.Social implicationsAll variables show a positive and significant relationship toward financial sustainability. Stated differently, micro-entrepreneurs are aware that understanding the basic concepts of Islamic finance may help them achieve long-term financial sustainabilityOriginality/valueThis study incorporates Islamic financial concepts into financial literacy while also assessing demographic aspects like years of business operation and education as moderators, which were not considered by previous studies.

TI  - Entrepreneurship as a Neglected Pitfall in Future Finnish Teachers' Readiness to Teach 21st Century Competencies and Financial Literacy: Expectancies, Values, and Capability
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine entrepreneurship in the context of future Finnish teachers' readiness to teach 21st century (broad-based) competencies. Teachers' self-efficacy in teaching entrepreneurial skills and financial matters is vital for their pupils to actively participate and flourish in future society. The study utilized survey data of future teachers' expectancy-values in teaching seven broad-based competencies of the current national curriculum and their financial literacy. Future teachers expressed high interest in all competencies but reported the least self-efficacy and highest cost in teaching ICT as well as working life and entrepreneurship competencies. Teaching self-efficacy (TSE) in entrepreneurial competencies was predicted by subjective evaluations of financial capability and TSE in consumer skills. Teaching STEM subjects as well as male gender were related to better objective financial knowledge. We discuss the implications of observed financial capability, lack in self-efficacy, and high experienced cost of teaching these competencies. Support for future teachers' readiness to teach working life skills, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy through phenomenon-based school subject collaboration, formal teacher training, and digital applications are emphasized.

TI  - How university business incubation supports entrepreneurs in technology-based and creative industries: A comparative study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Business incubators (BIs) provide entrepreneurs with access to critical resources (for example, physical, financial, knowledge, social, legitimacy, and so on) that support venture development. Little is known about how support needs differ between entrepreneurs pursuing technology-based (TB) and creative-industry (CI) opportunities. Yet these differences may affect their ability to benefit from incubation. This is the first comparative study addressing this gap. Focusing on university BIs, our qualitative analysis reveals that TB entrepreneurs benefit from physical capital supporting proof of concept, financial grants, and technical and industry-specific knowledge capital. In contrast, CI entrepreneurs benefit from physical capital supporting product development, financing of smaller-scale projects, and knowledge capital focused on business basics. External legitimacy was more important to TB entrepreneurs, while internal social capital mattered more to CI entrepreneurs. We draw on value creation and capture to explain these differences. The findings have implications for research and practice concerned with incubation and university-based entrepreneurial support.

TI  - Exploring the relationship between entrepreneurial ecosystem inputs and outcomes: the role of digital technology adoption
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThis work aims to explore the relationship between entrepreneurial ecosystems' (EEs) inputs and outcomes within a digital-technology-driven EE. Specifically, it focuses on how being part of an EE enhances digital technology adoption (DTA) and consequently facilitates EE outcomes.Design/methodology/approachThis paper employs a single-case study approach, focusing on Italian EE. The data analysis is based on the researchers' direct observations and semi-structured interviews with the EE founders' teams and the top management of the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating therein. Given the novelty of the topic and the lack of a clear research framework of analysis, a qualitative method is well suited for studying digital-technology-driven EE, thus gaining rich data about the phenomenon in a real-life context.FindingsThe findings of the study reveal that when specific eco-inputs (financial, knowledge, social and institutional assets) are correctly exploited to enhance DTA, important outcomes, namely, SME competitiveness and new technology-based venture creation and development, are generated.Originality/valueThe paper contributes to a relatively unexplored topic in the existing literature on EEs and digital technology. Specifically, through the proposition of a conceptual model, it sheds light on the relationship among EE inputs, DTA and EE outcomes.

TI  - Covid-19 and the changing face of financial literacy in India : Evidence from Delhi NCR during lockdowns
T2  - JOURNAL OF STATISTICS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
AB  - With a change in global market entanglement and composite retail financial products, financial literacy has gained distinction in the recent past. More importantly, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought attention to the preparation of individuals' financial budgets for unforeseen losses. As a result, financial literacy has gained immense importance. Literature available on the subject suggests that individuals when faced with a situation of crisis, tend to reduce their risk of not paying the liabilities, by controlling their budget. This research article aims to understand whether or not individuals with a good understanding of financial literacy have better skills in financial management, particularly during lockdowns. Primary data was collected after the second phase of lockdowns in August 2021 from 232 individuals residing in Delhi NCR, using a questionnaire adapted from the OECD study. Besides, a scale was developed to understand their financial behaviour and financial management skills. The results of the study indicate that a good understanding of financial principles helped manage financial risk effectively and avoid any financial pitfalls. It helps individuals avoid financial concerns and enable individuals to regulate their income, even in challenging conditions like the Covid-19 pandemic.

TI  - The influence of the cultural entrepreneur on the performance of cultural and creative firms
T2  - ACADEMIA-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ADMINISTRACION
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse the influence of the profile of cultural entrepreneurs (CE), in terms of their demographic characteristics and resources, on the performance of cultural and creative firms (CCFs).
   Design/methodology/approach Departing from demographic theory and resource-based view, two hypotheses have been formulated and empirically tested, using a multiple regression model, with a sample of 80 Spanish CCFs. The CCF performance has been measured through two objective (employment growth and profitability) and one subjective/perceptual measurements (satisfaction of the CE with the attainment of objectives).
   Findings With respect to the demographic variables, a negative relationship between the CE's age and employment growth, and a partial positive influence of the CE's prior experience on employment growth and the subjective measurement of performance have been found. Regarding to the CE's resources, the empirical evidence shows that there is no direct relationship between the CE's possession of any resources studied - financial, knowledge and social connections - and CCF performance.
   Originality/value This work makes three important contributions as it analyses the CE and focuses on CCF management, a topic little discussed in the entrepreneurship literature. Second, there is an analysis of some of the variables pertaining to the entrepreneur's demographic profile that have been applied to top management teams and in a more or less isolated way in the entrepreneurship area. And, finally, a multidimensional measurement is used to explain the CCF performance.

TI  - Entrepreneurial participation and performance: the role of financial literacy
T2  - MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurial activities, and the moderating effects of industrial regulation in the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurship.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In this study, the role of financial literacy on entrepreneurial participation and performance is investigated through multi-sourced data from the Chinese Family Panel Studies with manually merged provincial and industrial data from 2014. Four hypotheses are tested based on Probit and Tobit models. Moreover, instrumental variable method and principal component analysis are applied to provide robustness checks.
   Findings
   The empirical results demonstrate that financial literacy has significantly positive effects on entrepreneurial participation, as well as on entrepreneurial performance. In addition, industrial regulation positively moderates the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurial participation and performance, which indicates that financial literacy plays a more important role in promoting entrepreneurship in tightly regulated industries.
   Originality/value
   This study proposes and tests the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurial activities, which fills an important gap in the literature. The results in this paper provide evidence that financial literacy has positive impacts in both the entry and operation stages of entrepreneurship. This evidence provides theoretical foundations for policy making in popularizing financial knowledge and supporting entrepreneurial activities. Moreover, this research further reveals the effects of industrial regulation in the context of China, suggesting that the government should be more effective in promoting administrative decentralization and reducing unnecessary interventions.

TI  - Fashion entrepreneurial self-efficacy: development and validation of a domain-specific scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this research is to develop a multidimensional measurement of fashion domain entrepreneurial self-efficacy (FDESE) based on which fashion entrepreneurs will be able to better develop strategies to gain and sustain success in their business development. The research is crucial to advocate fashion entrepreneurship and will provide direction for fashion business incubation services. Design/methodology/approach This research included three stages with mixed qualitative and quantitative approaches: conceptualizing construct definition and specifying domain(s) to generate initial items, scale purification and scale validation. This study started with reviewing the literature and individual interviews among 19 fashion entrepreneurs, which generated 72 initial items. An online survey was then conducted with individuals who are running or have the intention to run fashion businesses, yielding 249 useable samples for scale purification, which generated 21 items for the validation phase. Lastly, another online survey was administered to individuals who are currently running fashion businesses which resulted in 258 valid responses included for scale validation. Findings A measure of FDESE that is both reliable and valid was developed, including 21 items across four distinct dimensions: passion for fashion business (five items), marketing and branding (seven items), financial management (five items) and creativity (four items). Originality/value This study is the first attempt to develop practical scales measuring self-efficacy that focus on fashion domain entrepreneurship. The newly developed FDESE scale indicates that entrepreneurship not only involves marketing skills, financial knowledge, creativity, leadership, and proactivity but also requires passion and persistence.

Results indicate the intergenerational transmission of illusion of control, loss -aversion, and overconfidence from parents to children as well as transmission of affinity bias only from parents to daughters. Financial knowledge and saving habits of students have a strong influence on the transmission of financial biases. In addition, we found a moderate effect of economic preferences in the transmission process.

TI  - A partial least squares approach to the financing behaviour of micro, small and medium enterprises
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING
AB  - The present study explores the financing behaviour of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) owners. A nexus of owners' personal attributes (PC) and behavioural aspects including financial knowledge (FK), financing motivation (M), and risk taking ability (R) has been created to determine the financing preferences (FP) and capital structure decision (CSD) of firm owners. The research framework adopts quantitative approach to the analysis. 274 responses were collected and analysed through partial least squares structural equation modelling on SmartPLSv2. The findings support the direct and mediating role of M and R in predicting FP and its relationship with PC. Moreover, the study confirms the role of FP in determining CSD in terms of pecking order behaviour among firm owners. The integration of owners' personal characteristics and behavioural factors in determining firms' financial decision adds value to the theory and practice of MSME financing.

TI  - Navigating the digital financial landscape: unraveling the impact of financial behavior traits on women-owned enterprises in the new normal perspective
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Exploring the financial behavior traits amidst the unexpected financial challenges and the unparalleled rise in fintech, this study provides insight into the interplay of entrepreneur digital financial literacy (EDFL), entrepreneur financial competency (EFC), and entrepreneur financial skill (EFS) impacting entrepreneur financial decision-making (EFDM). Toward this goal, data were gathered from 223 active women entrepreneurs from India who have accounts in the social media platform. The three-step hierarchical regression analysis disclosed that an entrepreneur with sound EDFL, EFS, and EFC can significantly enhance strategic decision-making (EFDM). The research outcome reveals that EFDM is a consistent predictor of the financial performance of women-owned enterprises. In addition, the entrepreneur's financial decision-making does not mediate the relationship between financial experience, financial competency, financial skill budgeting, and financial skill_acumen with financial performance. In contrast, partial mediation is observed between digital financial awareness, digital financial knowledge, and financial skill_analytics. The novel insight accounted for a significantly low level of experience in entrepreneurs' utilization of digital platforms for payment, financing loans, and asset management. The outcome carries academic, regulatory, and managerial significance, recognizing the unique interaction; the cumulative efforts strengthen the capacity to address socio-economic challenges and translate them into gender-specific policy interventions and practices.

TI  - Knowledge creates value: the role of financial literacy in entrepreneurial behavior
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Under the backdrop of economic globalization and the digital economy, entrepreneurial behavior has emerged not only as a focal point of management research but also as an urgent topic within the domain of family finance. This paper scrutinizes the ramifications of financial literacy on household entrepreneurial behavior utilizing data from China's sample of the China Household Finance Survey spanning the years 2015 and 2017. Employing the ordered Probit model, we pursue our research objectives. Our findings suggest that financial literacy exerts immediate, persistent, and evolving positive effects on households' engagement in entrepreneurial activities and their proclivity toward entrepreneurship. Through the mitigation of endogeneity in the regression model, the outcomes of the two-stage regression corroborate the primary regression results. An examination of heterogeneity unveils noteworthy disparities between urban and rural areas, as well as gender discrepancies, in how financial literacy influences household entrepreneurial behavior. Furthermore, this study validates three potential pathways-namely income, social network, and risk attitude channels-demonstrating that financial literacy significantly augments household income, expands social networks, and enhances risk attitudes. Moreover, through supplementary analysis, we ascertain that financial education amplifies the impact of financial literacy on entrepreneurial behavior. Our study contributes to the enrichment of human capital theory and modern entrepreneurship theory. It advocates for robust efforts by governments and financial institutions to widely disseminate financial knowledge and foster family entrepreneurship, thereby fostering the robust and stable operation of both the global financial market and the job market.

TI  - The impact and heterogeneity analysis of digital financial inclusion on non-farm employment of rural labor
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF POPULATION RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - This study examines the effects of digital financial inclusion on non-farm employment of rural labor and the mediating mechanism of innovation and entrepreneurship activity using China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and the provincial index of digital financial inclusion. Through the empirical test of the Probit model and mediation effect model, we found that: firstly, digital financial inclusion can promote non-farm employment of rural labor, with the level of digitalization having the most significant impact; secondly, by encouraging innovation and entrepreneurial activity, digital financial inclusion can promote non-farm employment of rural labor; thirdly, the driving effect of digital financial inclusion on non-farm employment of rural labor is more pronounced among the unmarried, eastern region, and male labor. Therefore, we should improve the construction of rural digital infrastructure and accelerate the development of inclusive rural finance to promote more diversified non-farm employment options for "disadvantaged groups"; encourage and support innovation at the government level, and create a favorable atmosphere for innovation and entrepreneurship. Simultaneously, farmers' digital literacy and financial knowledge should be improved so that more can adopt and take advantage of digital financial inclusion.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The study examines the influence of the five pillars of inclusive financing on the empowerment of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and the influence of institutional conditions on the empowerment of MSMEs. This study uses primary and secondary data. The population of the study are MSMEs; the is a total of 930,620 MSMEs in Jakarta. Owners of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises is a good population to be measured because they are the main actors that know exactly the challenges and the obstacles in doing business addressing problems faced in inclusive financing, which is related to the purpose of the study. The research borrows from finance and entrepreneurial theories for model design. The results of the study show that all the variables are significant and positive in the efforts to finance MSMEs in Indonesia, which means that financial education plays an important role in the sustainability of financial inclusion. The financial theory, developed to explain financing at the company level, needs to be adapted to the entrepreneurial situation, so that it can explain the behavior of small businesses. This means that, with correct financial knowledge, financial inclusion plays an important role in the sustainability of MSMEs in Indonesia.

T2  - STRATEGIC CHANGE-BRIEFINGS IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE
AB  - The use of personal finance smartphone apps results in an improvement in various measures used to assess financial knowledge and skills, attitudes and motivations, and financially capable behaviors for those in low-income households. Those provided with smartphone apps demonstrated increased self-confidence in financial decision-making and financial literacy and improved their ability to delay self-gratification and their sense of being able to effect change. Financially capable behavior changes manifested in being better able to keep track of finances and manage unexpected bills. User engagement with finance apps could be improved by targeting users with a specific financial decision-making problem, personalizing the apps through push notifications to encourage ongoing user engagement, and incorporating game mechanics.

TI  - Intangible capital and financial leverage in SMEs
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - PurposeIntangible capital (IC) is an important factor for economic growth and firm performance. The role IC has played has become even more crucial in recent decades, possibly influencing debt capacity and default risk assessment. This paper studies how entrepreneurial and employee-based IC affects financial leverage.Design/methodology/approachEmployer-employee unbalanced panel data provided by Statistics Finland that refer to Finnish small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are used. Intangibles are measured with an expenditure-based method. Employee-based IC and entrepreneurial knowledge are used to explain debt financing in SMEs.FindingsThe findings imply that IC-intensive firms have less debt capacity due to weak pledgeability and asymmetric information between borrower and lender. Entrepreneurs with managerial or financial knowledge increase the firm's debt capacity compared to other entrepreneurs, especially in knowledge-intensive services (KIS). One explanation is that the entrepreneurs are more competent in negotiating with lenders as the entrepreneurs possess better financial skills. Entrepreneurs with technical knowledge decrease the firm's debt capacity in all industries.Originality/valueWhile some earlier research focused on the IC-financial leverage relationship, hardly any study has looked at entrepreneurial IC. This paper provides new insights by including entrepreneurial IC alongside employee-based IC.

T2  - CUADERNOS DE ECONOMIA-SPAIN
AB  - This study investigates the essential characteristics of the personal financial landscape of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Saudi Arabia, with a specific focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 154 respondents, comprising owners, managers, and administrators of Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, were surveyed to gather data. The results of the study indicate that younger entrepreneurs and businesses experienced greater financial consequences, particularly among owners aged 18-30 and 31-45, compared to older age groups. However, both younger and older entrepreneurs demonstrated a higher level of financial knowledge and awareness regarding emergency finance options. Overall, the outbreak had a significant impact on both the national and global economies. This study offers a significant contribution to the extant body of literature pertaining to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).

TI  - Mobile payment and risky financial market participation: evidence from China
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Mobile payments have developed rapidly, becoming an indispensable payment tool for households in China. In this study, we examine the impact of mobile payments on risky financial market participation using data from the 2017 China Household Finance Survey. After considering endogeneity and selection bias problems, we find that households that use mobile payments are more likely to participate in risky financial markets. Additionally, various robustness tests demonstrate the validity of our results. According to the mechanism analysis, mobile payments are likely to operate by improving information search, social interaction, and risk tolerance. Furthermore, we do not find any inclusive characteristics of mobile payments in our study. The positive effect of mobile payments is more pronounced in households with higher levels of financial knowledge, income, and education.

TI  - An institutional view on access to finance by Tanzanian women-owned enterprises
T2  - VENTURE CAPITAL
AB  - We investigate the limited use of bank and microfinance loans by Tanzanian female entrepreneurs. Using survey data, we observe that female entrepreneurs mainly use informal sources to finance their businesses. We analyze how "perceptions" of gendered cognitive and normative institutions determine whether a female entrepreneur applies for a formal loan. Following results stand out: first, we find that high collateral requirements, interest rates and personal guarantee requirements make formal loans unattractive. Second, female entrepreneurs only apply when they expect to be successful. Since they "perceive" access to finance to be more problematic for women, female entrepreneurs are discouraged from applying. Third, female entrepreneurs "perceive" they have insufficient access to financial knowledge which again will prevent them from applying. This study contributes to theory by exploring the effect of entrepreneurs' perceptions of the institutional business environment on financing behavior. Furthermore, we show that the low use of formal loans by female entrepreneurs is primarily demand-driven, which calls into question the effectivity of policy recommendations aiming to increase supply of formal loans.

TI  - A resource-based analysis of strategic alliances between knowledge intermediaries in regional innovation support systems
T2  - INDUSTRY AND HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Notwithstanding a recent upsurge in interest in knowledge intermediaries and their roles in innovation support systems, we know little about the interplay between the activities of academia-driven intermediaries and their publicly financed counterparts. Building on a combination of principles derived from the resource-based theory and entrepreneurial ecosystems literature, this paper investigates the potentials of cooperation between different knowledge intermediaries. Therefore, the authors analyze the alignment of financial, knowledge, market and network resources in politically funded regional alliances between university-internal and university-external intermediaries by means of a qualitative approach. They find that, while knowledge intermediaries can benefit from access to additional ecosystem-specific resources, the urge to improve their own position within the ecosystem hampers the will to cooperate and can lead to non-performing resource alignments. The paper contributes to current scholarly discussions by suggesting and testing a theoretical foundation for analyzing the cooperative behavior of knowledge intermediaries in innovation support systems.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY: THE IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF THE SMEs IN KUCHING
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - This study aims at investigating the financial knowledge, financial behaviour and the attitude towards finance amongst on small medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) in Kuching. More specifically on how these powerful factors affect the profitability on fast growing business enterprises in largest city in the Borneo Island over the last decade. The research takes a descriptive approach fitting its underlying pursue and draws interesting conclusions with over 75% response rate. Analysis of the data collected clearly reveals that the knowledge of finance in general relates significantly stronger to the bottom line of these business entities relative to the owners' financial attitude and their ensuing behaviour towards financial decision making. Therefore, small medium entrepreneurs are highly recommended to participate in financial education on a regular basis to keep them well informed and equipped with the latest ways of managing the finances of their businesses to ensure better financial planning, execution and monitoring of enterprises that inevitably will lead to increased and sustainable earnings.

TI  - Financial literacy, access to finance, SMEs performance and Islamic religiosity: evidence from Saudi Arabia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP & SMALL BUSINESS
AB  - This paper seeks to explore the impact of access to finance and financial literacy on the SMEs performance in an Islamic context. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design by employing 255 SMEs in Saudi Arabia. The findings showed a positive mediating effect of access to finance on the relationship between financial awareness, financial attitude and SMEs performance while access to finance does not mediate the nexus between financial knowledge and SMEs performance. Subsequently, the findings revealed that access to finance have positive effect on SMEs performance. This study also found that access to finance increases the positive relationship between financial literacy and SMEs performance. The role of religiosity was found to positively increase access to finance towards affecting SMEs performance. The findings of this study provide SMEs with the knowledge to increase their religious practices to access government Islamic funds, i.e., Mudarabah and Musharakah while Islamic banking firms should increase their Islamic products and services to attract SMEs in Saudi Arabia.

TI  - The effect of audit committee attributes and gender diversity on audit quality
T2  - JOURNAL FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The overreliance on the audit committee's (AC) financial knowledge solely to enhance its oversight role is detrimental to corporate governance practices. The evidence about the effect of other characteristics that can be crucial for the efficiency of the AC, which affects audit and financial statements quality, is lacking. The study aims to explore the influence of AC members' independence, the involvement of female executives, and the specific characteristics of the French business landscape on the quality of audits. In this investigation, 930 data points were analysed, drawn from a selection of 93 French companies listed on the SBF 120 index over a decade, spanning from 2012 to 2021. The research reveals that while AC independence positively contributes to audit quality, the expertise of committee members and gender diversity have a significant adverse effect on audit quality. This may have implications for decision-makers in France as well as in other nations with similar institutional environments that they should consider when developing future regulatory reforms.

TI  - Homeownership and financial literacy: evidence from China in the perspective of 'learning by doing'
T2  - HOUSING STUDIES
AB  - Financial literacy is becoming an increasingly important policy consideration, yet its determinants are still underexplored. From the theoretical perspective of 'learning by doing', the effect of homeownership on financial literacy in urban China is identified by the instrumental variable strategy. First, the borrowing experience to purchase a home can awaken homeowners to develop basic financial knowledge, but the resulting debt burden constrains homeowners from participating in the financial market, crowding out their access to advanced financial skills. Second, the growth in home equity wealth induces homeowners pledge high-value properties as collateral and invest in more homes, in which case the collateralizing experience facilities the advancement of basic finance literacy, while locking the asset portfolio in the housing sector hinders homeowners from learning advanced financial skills. Moreover, the specific kind of financial literacy that homeowners show an advantage in differs depending on their income. These findings cast a new light on understanding the return of housing property to family financial affairs.

TI  - Economic Education, Digital Literacy and Intention to Invest Among Students: The Mediating Role of Financial Attitudes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INSTRUCTION
AB  - The pandemic has raised the students' activities in finding income, ranging from entrepreneurship to investing intention. This study aims to determine the role of economic education and digital literacy on student investment interest in universities during the Covid-19 period. In the analytical model proposed, it is assumed that the financial attitude variable is a mediating variable in education and financial knowledge in investment intentions. Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior and Bandura's Social Learning Theory was developed for the research model. The research adopted quantitative methods using survey research data from saturated sampling techniques. The participants in this study were students of Universitas Negeri Jakarta who are members of the Indonesian stock exchange investment gallery organization. From the 234 proposed questionnaires, 203 questionnaires were returned and filled out completely for data analysis. The study results confirmed the three hypotheses and rejected the four proposed hypotheses. Economic education affects student investment intentions and significantly affects financial attitudes. However, digital literacy affects students' investment intentions but fails to shape investment intentions through financial attitudes. Another finding is that economic education and digital literacy have no effect on shaping financial attitudes, but financial attitudes influence students' investment intentions during the pandemic.

TI  - Hubris or talent? Estimating the role of overconfidence in Chinese households' investment decisions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - We document the extent to which overconfidence in one's financial literacy (FL overconfidence) plays a role in households' reported financial risk aversion and their actual investment behavior, using data from the China Household Finance Survey. We measure FL overconfidence by estimating the gap between people's self-reported financial literacy and their objectively measured financial knowledge. Our results indicate that FL overconfidence is negatively associated with self-reported financial risk aversion. Additionally, FL overconfidence is positively associated with the likelihood of having a brokerage account, holding risky financial instruments (other than just stock), and a proportion of assets allocated towards risky assets. We then use machine learning methods to predict which factors are most important in determining households' risky investment decisions. We find that overconfidence plays a significant predictive role. Our work signals that households' risky investments may be driven by biased optimism about their own financial know-how rather than their actual knowledge. We conclude that financial literacy programs should not only teach financial concepts but also make program participants aware of their own biases.

TI  - Financial modeling and improvement planning for the life insurance industry by using a rough knowledge based hybrid MCDM model
T2  - INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB  - Financial modeling for the life insurance industry involves two main difficulties: (1) Selecting the minimal and critical variables for modeling while considering the impreciseness and interrelationships among the numerous attributes and (2) measuring plausible synergy effects among variables and dimensions that might cause undesirable biases for an evaluation model. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes a two-stage hybrid approach: Rough financial knowledge is retrieved first, and then the obtained core attributes are measured and synthesized using fuzzy-integral-based decision methods. The main innovation of this study is the use of rough knowledge retrieval procedures and fuzzy measures for exploring the synergy effects on financial performance. This approach is expected to support insurers to systematically improve their financial performance. A group of life insurance companies in Taiwan was analyzed, and the findings support the existence of interrelated synergy effects among the core criteria. In addition, five companies were examined to illustrate financial performance improvement planning with this approach. This study bridges the gap between advanced soft computing techniques and pragmatic financial modeling in a dynamic business environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The subjective well-being of self-employed persons: a national survey evidence from Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose This study aims to examine the subjective well-being of self-employed persons relative to wage employees in Ghana. Two measures of subjective well-being, comprising life satisfaction and happiness, are considered. Design/methodology/approach The current study focuses on Ghanaian working adults, uses pooled cross-sectional datasets from the 2005 to 2014 World Values Survey (WVS), applies survey weights, estimates ordered probit models and computes marginal effects. Findings The results show that being self-employed is associated with a lower probability of being satisfied with life than being wage employed. The result for happiness is negative but not statistically significant. The perceived low level of life satisfaction among the self-employed in Ghana could explain the rationale behind the desire of some Ghanaians to seek wage employment rather than pursuing self-employment. The results also could partly explain the non-survival of some entrepreneurial firms in Ghana over time. Research limitations/implications Data relating to factors such as business size, location (urban or rural), degree of internationalization (domestic or foreign), number of years of being in self-employment, the number of employees, financial knowledge and behavior and personality traits are unavailable in the WVS for analyses. The present study also uses a pooled cross-sectional dataset for the analyses; thus, causal inferences are not possible. Originality/value The study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between self-employment and subjective well-being in the context of Ghana. The study provides insights into how self-employed Ghanaians perceive well-being relative to wage employees.

TI  - Remittance usage for rural hometown investing in the Philippines: A mixed methods study
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - This paper analyzes differences in attitudes and strategies for investing and entrepreneurship among families receiving remittances from their overseas emigrants at two rural communities in the Philippines. It examines how these households in the origin country determine how to invest remittances, and the extent to which these de-cisions are influenced by topographical, socio-economic, political, and cultural factors in their local spatial contexts. How do individual behaviors, along with risk appetite and financial capabilities, interact with such contexts as origin households assess the hazards and likely returns of investing locally? Primary data collected through household surveys in 2018-2019, and a rapid qualitative inquiry methodology, enable us in this mixed methods research to explore the interplay between individual financial behaviors and spatial factors affecting decision making. We can report that migrants' origin households, and local financial institutions and entre-preneurs, employ relevant costing in reaching economic decisions, and assess favorable and adverse investment considerations explicitly. Remittance-supported economic development in origin communities relies on en-hancements in household financial knowledge, and on interventions -through policy and regulation- to sustain and improve the local investment climate. If these conditions are met, households and local investors and en-trepreneurs will make productive decisions through this relevant costing strategy and will contribute resources that promote microeconomic development. Relevant costing is thereby vindicated as a valuable concept, in at-tempts to unravel besetting complexities in the migration-development nexus.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT OF SME
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMY
AB  - Numerous research studies deal with the issue of researching the impacts on credit risk determinants in the SME segment. The study of economic factors that are easier to quantify from methodological point of view, and which prevent complex evaluation of causality of interest rate risk and the discovery of various social barriers dominate. This consistent fact forms a platform in designing the research to introduce a model of dependency of effective credit risk management in the SME segment on significant social and economic factors. Empirical research was carried out in the Czech business environment in 2017 on a sample of 352 enterprises. The structural analysis modeling (SEM) was the main analytical method. The research results confirmed the fact that an effective approach to managing the SME's credit risk is determined by a number of factors of a non-economic nature. The most important are education and family environment. These are followed by economic factors, such as a relationship with banks, financial knowledge in the area of capital and payment discipline. The multi-spectral dimension of the findings and causality also opened up a wide discussion and prepared a high-quality data research base for further deeper exploration of this issue.

TI  - Spenders and Savers, Tightwads and Spendthrifts: Individual Correlates of Personal Ratings of Being a Spender or a Saver
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE PSYCHOLOGY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - There is limited literature on the causes, correlates, and consequences of being a saver (tightwad) or a spender (spendthrift). This paper reports on five studies which look at demographic, bright- and dark-side personality, money belief, and self-evaluation correlates of to what extent a person considers themselves a spender or saver. In each study, adult participants indicated their spender-saver habits on a single scale and completed a number of tests. The first study looked at trait correlates and showed savers were close-minded, conscientious, stable, extraverts. It also showed as predicted that savers were more likely to associate money with security, and not love or freedom, and claim to have better financial knowledge. The results from the second study on dark-side personality correlates indicated that spenders were more likely to have psychopathic tendencies, but less likely to be Machiavellian. The third study on personality disorder correlates of spender-saver tendencies suggested that spenders were likely to have elevated Cluster B personality disorders. The fourth study examined self-beliefs and showed savers rated themselves as more attractive, healthy, and intelligent than spenders. The fifth study, also using various self-ratings, showed spenders had more liberal political views, report higher emotional intelligence and are less likely to own their own home, while savers rated their physical health higher, and saw themselves as more entrepreneurial. Overall, the results suggest the simple saver-spender question is logically correlated with a number of individual difference variables with savers having a more positive profile. Implications and limitations are considered.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The paper's main goal is to examine the relationship between the video marketing of financial technologies (Fintechs) and their vulnerable website customers' brand engagement in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis.
   Design/methodology/approach - To extract the required outcomes, the authors gathered data from the five biggest Fintech websites and YouTube channels, performed multiple linear regression models and developed a hybrid (agent-based and dynamic) model to assess the performance connection between their video marketing analytics and vulnerable website customers' brand engagement.
   Findings - It has been found that video marketing analytics of Fintechs' YouTube channels are a decisive factor in impacting their vulnerable website customers' brand engagement and awareness.
   Research limitations/implications - By enhancing video marketing analytics of their YouTube channels, Fintechs can achieve greater levels of vulnerable website customers' engagement and awareness. Higher levels of vulnerable customers' brand engagement and awareness tend to decrease their vulnerability by enhancing their financial knowledge and confidence.
   Practical implications - Fintechs should aim to increase the number of total videos on their YouTube channels and provide videos that promote their customers' knowledge of their services to increase their brand engagement and awareness, thus reducing their vulnerability. Moreover, Fintechs should be aware not to over-post videos because they will be in an unfavorable position against their competitors.
   Originality/value - This research offers valuable insights regarding the importance of video marketing strategies for Fintechs in promoting their vulnerable website customers' brand awareness during crisis periods.

TI  - Does Digital Inclusive Finance Mitigate the Negative Effect of Climate Variation on Rural Residents' Income Growth in China?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have exacerbated climate variation. Climate variation impacts the agricultural production and rural residents' income negatively, further widening the urban-rural income gap and harming the co-benefits. Narrowing the income gap has always been a global concern and an important part of China's rural revitalization strategy. However, little is known about whether digital inclusive finance can mitigate the negative impact of climate variation on rural residents' income growth in China. Using panel data from 31 provinces in China from 2011 to 2019 and a digital inclusive finance index developed by Peking University, together with historical temperature data, this study examined the impact of digital inclusive finance on Chinese rural residents' income growth in response to climate variation. It was found that digital inclusive finance could promote rural resident operating, wage, and transfer income growth. A heterogeneity analysis revealed that rural residents in central and western regions experienced larger digital inclusive finance facilitating effects on income growth than the eastern regions. Further analyses using the Spatial Dubin Model found that digital inclusive finance had a spatial spillover effect as it could significantly promote income growth in neighboring provinces. Although climate variation reduced rural residents' income and increased their risks, digital inclusive finance significantly mitigated this negative effect. Digital information infrastructure construction, financial risk prevention, digital financial knowledge, and e-commerce popularization were practical paths to optimizing inclusive finance development in rural areas and promoting poverty alleviation and rural revitalization to resist climate risks.

TI  - Research on the Effect of the Rural Wealth-Leader on Poverty Reduction of Farmers-Based on the Questionnaire Survey in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The rural wealth-leader is one of the 10 projects of targeted poverty alleviation in the period of poverty alleviation. As the "leading wild goose" in rural areas, the personal characteristics of the rural wealth-leader directly affect the effect of stabilizing poverty and increasing income of poor farmers. Based on the survey of the rural wealth-leader in 10 cities and 21 counties, this paper systematically analyzes the path of poverty reduction by the rural wealth-leader, combs out the key individual characteristics that affect farmers' poverty reduction, and puts forward a research hypothesis. Through empirical analysis, the research hypothesis is tested and the influencing mechanism is analyzed. The model results show that: The rural wealth-leader has a significant effect on increasing farmers' income and eliminating poverty. The rural wealth-leader with high education level and engaged in e-commerce has a significant effect on increasing farmers' income. Party members and the skilled rural wealth-leaders have a significant impact on rural households' poverty alleviation. The income increasing effect of culture and education is negatively affected by corporate loans, and the income increasing effect of e-commerce is negatively affected by corporate profits. Therefore, we should improve the profit distribution mode of e-commerce related enterprises to avoid farmers being marginalized in the process of e-commerce development. The skills, management and financial knowledge training of the rural wealth-leaders should be strengthened to improve their knowledge and skills. Meanwhile, supporting fiscal, financial and tax policies should be improved.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to examine the relationship between religiosity and branding on small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs') performance in Saudi Arabia. It also examines the mediating role of financial literacy on the relationship among Islamic religiosity, branding and SMEs' performance.
   Design/methodology/approach This study adopts the purposive sampling technique in three major commercial cities, namely, Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Qassim to sample 100 SMEs each, resulting in a total sampling of 300 SMEs in Saudi Arabia. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze the hypotheses formulated in this study. The structural equation modeling is aided with the help of Smart-PLS software.
   Findings This study finds that Islamic branding (on customer, compliance and origin) significantly affect financial attitude, while Islamic religiosity affects financial awareness among the SMEs. Findings reveal that there is a mediating role of financial awareness on the relationship between Islamic branding and Islamic religiosity with the SMEs' performance. No mediation effect was recorded for financial attitude and financial knowledge. Further investigation reveals that financial attitude, financial awareness, Islamic branding (compliance and origin) and Islamic religiosity were the most significant determinants of SMEs' performance in the context of Saudi Arabia.
   Research limitations/implications This study is conducted on SMEs in Saudi Arabia only. Further studies are required to examine SMEs in other Islamic countries and regions to improve the explanatory power of financial literacy on Islamic religiosity and Islamic branding for improved SMEs performance.
   Originality/value This study establishes that Islamic religiosity and branding could further increase the predictive power of financial literacy on SMEs' performance. This study concludes that efforts to improve financial literacy should be religion-based as well as culture-based depending on where the SMEs are located so that specific strategies can be implemented, to enable the conducive growth of the SMEs and maximize the contribution of the SMEs to economic growth.

TI  - What restricts SMEs from adopting sophisticated capital budgeting practices?
T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - Plain English Summary Capital budgeting is a financial management instrument that evaluates potential investment alternatives and decides which investment project will benefit the firm most. It deals with large long-term funds and their allocations. Despite its prominence, studies report that small and medium enterprises do not practice capital budgeting. This study explores the barriers faced by small and medium enterprises towards the use of capital budgeting while making their long-term investment decisions. The study finds that the lack of financial knowledge and training of the decision-maker and the complexity, calculation difficulty, and time associated with the capital budgeting techniques are the biggest impediments to the practice of capital budgeting among small firms.
   The lack of robust financial management is an integral growth constraint faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). For the sustainability and growth of SMEs, it is vital to choose the correct long-term projects. Yet, literature shows that SMEs across the globe hardly practice the sophisticated capital budgeting (CB) method. The present study identifies, prioritizes, and proposes a structural model of the barriers to CB practices. The study adopts an integrated method combining the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (F-AHP) and the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL) approach to evaluate the barriers to CB practices among SMEs in India. The prioritization obtained through the F-AHP suggests that the knowledge barrier of the decision-makers and the inherent barrier associated with the CB techniques are the most weighted main barriers impeding the practice of CB among SMEs. Also, the most important sub-barriers are time consumption and high complexity of the methods, lack of financial education and training of decision-makers, and lack of computation technology. F-DEMATEL provides a reliable quantitative measure of the association of the barriers to implementing sophisticated CB practices among SMEs. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to identify, prioritize, and structure the barriers to CB practices. Also, it is the first to apply multi-criteria decision-making tools in this field of research. Our findings can help financial managers/practitioners of SMEs to formulate sophisticated CB techniques in their investment decision strategies and efficiently manage their long-term funds.

TI  - Impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThe study focused on the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs at the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia, from 2019 to 2023.Design/methodology/approachThe design of the paper is empirical-analytical, focusing on the tangible and unique aspects of reality that can be fragmented for measurement. This approach privileges the use of data from the study population's experience, which is treated analytically through statistics to establish frequencies and correlations between variables. The research involved a structured questionnaire based on bibliographic references and considering the operational framework of the variables, which underwent expert review, necessary adjustments, a pilot test and subsequent validation in 2019 and 2023. The reliability of the instrument was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, ensuring a reliable indicator when equal to or greater than 0.7 in each analysis period. This methodology aimed to identify practices and how the financial profile influences short term.FindingsThe findings from the survey conducted with the microentrepreneurs at Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center reveal several significant connections to the theoretical framework. The study revealed that many microentrepreneurs relied on their personal funds for business financing, indicating a limited understanding of financial principles. Additionally, a significant portion of microentrepreneurs mitigated investment risk by securing loans from financial institutions, yet none utilized government subsidies like entrepreneurship loans, pointing to a lack of advice. The findings underscore the importance of financial education and suitable financial services for business development.Research limitations/implicationsOne limitation of this study is the lack of detailed data on the financial structure of microentrepreneurs' businesses, as well as specific information on interest rates and the terms and conditions of the microcredit used. These limitations may affect the generalization of the results and the comprehensive understanding of the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs. Future research could include a larger sample size and more accurate data on the financial structure of businesses, as well as a detailed investigation of interest rates and terms and conditions of microcredit, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the financial impacts for microentrepreneurs.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study have practical implications for microentrepreneurs in the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center. The research emphasizes the need for improved financial knowledge, accounting practices and debt management among microentrepreneurs. It also highlights the importance of financial education and access to suitable financial services for business development. The study's insights can guide the development of training programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing financial literacy and financial management among microentrepreneurs, leading to more informed decision-making and improved financial outcomes.Social implicationsFrom a social perspective, this research contributes to promoting economic development and financial inclusion. By addressing the mismanagement of microcredit by microentrepreneurs and providing insights into their short-term finances, the study aims to foster economic empowerment and sustainable development within communities.
   The findings underscore the significance of microfinance in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. The research emphasizes the importance of equitable access to financial services, which can contribute to narrowing the gap between the financially excluded population and the conventional financial system.Originality/valueThis research adds originality and value to the academic community by addressing the incidence of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs in the specific context of the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia. By characterizing the financial profile of microentrepreneurs, establishing the relationship between microcredit characteristics and the financial profile and proposing an action plan, the study provides valuable insights for decision-making in both the academic and microfinance fields. The research contributes to the existing literature on microfinance and financial inclusion, offering a unique perspective and potential solutions for optimizing the use of microcredit-funded resources by microentrepreneurs.

TI  - Examining the dynamics leading towards credit card usage attitude: an empirical investigation using importance performance map analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - Many researchers have investigated the consumer's attitude towards using credit cards. However, how the different attributes contribute to credit card usage attitude is not evident. Thus, the main theoretical contribution of this study is to examine the importance and performance of a set of variables that explain the attitude towards using credit cards. It provides essential inputs to banking institutions towards the relationship between bank image, credit knowledge, transaction behaviour, transaction control behaviour, and credit card usage attitude using cognitive-motivational-relational (CMR) theory. We used an adapted questionnaire to survey 383 Indian consumers from the National Capital Region (NCR). We applied variance-based partial least square structural equational modelling (PLS-SEM) on SmartPLS software to identify the importance and performance of each variable using importance performance map analysis (IMPA). Some significant findings include that credit knowledge and transaction behaviour are essential constructs determining credit card usage attitude. Moreover, the study also found that if banks enhance the credit knowledge of their consumers, they could build positive attitudes among consumers, based upon which their service marketing strategies could be shaped accordingly.
