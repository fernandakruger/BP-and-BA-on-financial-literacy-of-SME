TI  - How does the web game design influence the behavior of e-banking users?
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AB  - Gamification has a clear influence on software design, development arid plays an important role in the motivation and intention of users to use a website and buy online. Nevertheless, in the case of e-banking, the influence of gamification in software design and on the user's intention to use are still very unclear. We intend to verify how game design elements and mechanics combined in the design of a bank website, influence the intention of customers to use e-banking. To explore and analyze the effects of gamification on a bank website, we propose a conceptual model considering the interaction between six variables: gamification, ease of use, information, design, web page characteristics, and intention to use the website. To test this model we develop a quantitative study involving 219 bank customers as participants who interacted with a gamified e-banking website to manage their financial investments. Participants then responded to an online questionnaire (including items related to the main variables), in order to measure their reactions to gamified software and their intentions. All data were statistically analyzed and results indicate that gamification has a significant influence on the ease of use and the intention to use e banking, as well as on the web design, information, and webpage characteristics. We find that gamification may motivate customers to use e-banking, and that it improves their financial literacy and facilitates online processes and transactions. This study provides insightful guidelines for web design, development and e-banking contents that can be taken into account by marketing, IT, and business teams working in electronic banks.

TI  - Evolving strategies for improving the performance of farmer producer companies through field studies
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB  - Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) were spearheaded for the integration of resource-poor farmers with the market systems in India. However, 45% of the FPCs aged more than five years had become dormant in function. The present study was undertaken to identify, validate and prioritise the strategies which could facilitate the improved performance of FPCs and ensure their sustainability in the long run. The list of strategies was identified through focus group discussions along with personal and telephonic interviews with experts associated with FPCs, viz. FPC officials (CEO, BODs), farmers, promoting agencies, customers, and government officials. Later, it was administered as a semi-structured interview schedule to experts for validation and prioritization using the Garrett ranking technique. The prominent prioritized strategies were 'Capacity building of BODS to manage FPC business activities on their own', and 'Designing a well-defined business plan for the FPC' for the stakeholder category Promoting agencies/ CBBOs, 'FPCs need to strive to build trust among the member farmers','Increasing the active membership strength' were prioritized under the FPC category. Subsequently, 'Building adequate knowledge on advantages of business association with FPC', and 'Motivating members of an FPC to build their own capacities such as financial literacy' were ranked first for the farmers category. Under the category of customers, 'Showing readiness to participate in customer satisfaction surveys,' and 'Updating knowledge on FPC products by discussions with friends and family' were ranked first. 'Reorienting the policy focus from mere formation to sustained incubation of FPCs' and 'Establishing platforms for FPCs to engage in policy advocacy and representation at various levels' could ensure the sustainability of FPCs in India.

TI  - The effects of ethnicity, gender and parental financial socialisation on financial knowledge among Gen Z: the case of Sarawak, Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial socialisation experiences, socio-economic factors, demographic characteristics and the financial knowledge of first year undergraduate students. Design/methodology/approach Using a questionnaire, data were collected from a sample of 450 first year university students from both private and public universities. A multivariate regression method was adopted to examine the influence of financial socialisation among respondents of different ethnic groups and their social backgrounds on the individual's financial knowledge. Findings The findings indicate that: firstly, financial knowledge is low among first-year university students in Sarawak. Secondly, male respondents outperform female counterparts in terms of financial knowledge. Thirdly, parental financial socialisation remains the main source of financial knowledge among the students. Fourthly, there are significant differences in financial knowledge across ethnic groups. Research limitations/implications It is paramount to implement financial education programmes to elevate the financial literacy for both youth and parents since parents remain the primary source of financial socialisation for young adults. Practical implications The study suggests that financial knowledge varies according to gender and ethnicity. Hence, financial education programmes should be designed to accommodate the differences between groups based on ethnicity and gender to achieve the best outcome. Originality/value This is the first study that draws a representative sample of university students in Sarawak that examines the effects of ethnicity, gender and parental financial socialisation on financial knowledge among first year university students.

TI  - Implications of Shariah Financial Technology in Increasing Financial Inclusion to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises
T2  - ISLAMIYYAT-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC STUDIES
AB  - Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSAEs) have long been understood as playing a significant role in the economic development of a country. However MSMEs have not been able to make a significant contribution to the economy due to constraints of capital problems and limitations in meeting the requirements of bureaucracy and banking administration when applying for loan funds from banks. Due to the limited services provided by banks, the emergence of financial technology (fintech) innovation is an opportunity for MSAE's to overcome their capital problems. However, the use of fintech triggers risks borne by users or consumers such as cyber risks related to data security, data ownership, privacy, and data governance. Shariah-based fintech is one solution to extend financial inclusion to MSMEs to overcome their capital problems. The purpose of this research is to analyze the development and the contribution of Shariah fintech in strengthening the financial inclusion of MSMEs. The method used in this qualitative descriptive research is by describing and interpreting the observations and findings of 5 Shariah fintech platforms that focus on MSMEs' funding as the research sample. The result shows that the market share of Shariah fintech is 2.01% of the total fintech platform and it is caused by the lack of Shariah financial literacy. In terms of risk, even though the financing risk is relatively lower than Bank's Non-Performing Loan, other risks may arise, such as cyber risk and Shariah compliance risk. In order to mitigate the risks, the authority needs regulations for cyber security for consumer protection and supervision of Shariah compliance by the National Shariah Council of the Indonesian Ulama Council.

TI  - "One size doesn't fit all". Bank switching decisions and customer vulnerability in Europe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThis paper examines the relationships between bank switching and both customer vulnerability and consumer-oriented policies (financial education and disclosure practices).Design/methodology/approachThe analysis employs microdata from the Special Eurobarometer on Financial Products and Services, for 24 European nations. It carries out a probit estimation on the factors explaining propensity of bank switching, focusing on three characteristics associated with customer vulnerability: an advanced age, low educational attainment and residence in a rural or a relatively poor region.FindingsThe authors report that the probability of bank switching is significantly lower for three groups of vulnerable customers: the elderly, the less educated and those living in deprived regions. Further the authors identify that national financial education policies and disclosure practices have no significant effects on bank switching.Research limitations/implicationsBased on these results, the authors propose more targeted policies recognising customers' heterogeneity are required to increase bank switching behaviour.Originality/valueThis paper exploits a unique source of information on bank switching behaviour and customer characteristics across European nations. These data are complemented with information about consumer financial education policies and disclosure practices from the World Bank and geographical, market and regulatory factors at the regional and national levels. The paper contributes to two academic areas. First, it presents further evidence on heterogeneity of bank customer switching behaviour, addressed at improving the understanding of customer vulnerability in banking services. Second, it examines the efficacy of consumer-oriented policies (financial literacy and disclosure practices) in encouraging bank switching.

TI  - A Crime by Any Other Name: Gender Differences in Moral Reasoning When Judging the Tax Evasion of Cryptocurrency Traders
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
AB  - Tax evasion is a major issue for authorities worldwide. Understanding the factors that influence individuals' intrinsic motivation to pay taxes, known as their tax morale, is important for improving tax compliance. This study investigated gender differences in judging tax evasion in the context of cryptocurrency trading. Specifically, a survey study explored whether different moral foundations, financial literacies, and political orientations among females vs. males might explain potential gender differences in judging tax evasion. In an online survey, 243 U.S. adults read a vignette about a friend evading taxes in a cryptocurrency trading context. In a correlational analysis, we found that females judged tax evasion harsher, as being more morally wrong than males. Of the psychographic factors, only individualizing moral foundation values (i.e., fairness and harm avoidance) explained the harsher moral judgment by females. That is, individualizing moral foundation values were at a higher level among females, which further predicted females' harsher judgment of tax evasion. While females also had, on average, lower financial literacy and knowledge of cryptocurrencies than males, these did not predict their harsher judgment of tax evasion. The findings contribute to research on gender differences in moral judgments and highlight that a given transgression, or a specific crime, may violate different moral values in men and women. The results demonstrate to policy makers that it is important to take into account gender differences, in campaigns promoting tax morale and compliance.

TI  - The Household Multidimensional Poverty Reduction Effects of Digital Financial Inclusion: A Financial Environment Perspective
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - The poverty alleviation effects of digital financial inclusion are widely recognized, while these effects are dependent on the financial environment. However, little is known about how the financial environment influences digital financial inclusion, which leads to a reduction in household multidimensional poverty. Using matching data from Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China and Chinese Family Panel Studies for 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018, this paper estimates the impact of digital financial inclusion on household multidimensional poverty, considering the financial environment. The results show that: (1) Digital financial inclusion alleviates household multidimensional poverty and has significant alleviation effects on different dimensions of poverty. (2) Digital financial inclusion plays a particularly significant role in reducing household multidimensional poverty in China's rural areas and central-western regions. (3) Credit availability, social capital, and non-agricultural employment are important channels through which digital financial inclusion reduces household multidimensional poverty. (4) A single threshold effect governs the influence of the financial environment on the impact of digital financial inclusion on household multidimensional poverty. When the financial environment crosses the threshold value, the poverty reduction effect of digital financial inclusion is enhanced. For the components of the financial environment, a single threshold effect governs the influence of both traditional financial foundations and household financial literacy on the impact of digital financial inclusion on multidimensional poverty, whereas government financial supervision does so via a double threshold effect.

TI  - Financial access and the finance-growth nexus: evidence from developing economies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose This study examines the impact of financial institutions access and financial institutions depth on economic growth in 51 low- and lower-middle-income countries from 1996 to 2017. Design/methodology/approach The study employs an index of financial institutions depth and financial institutions access that considers the multidimensional nature of finance. The study employs a generalised least squares model as the baseline fixed effects model suffers from serial correlation. In addition, the study examines the marginal impact of financial development on growth at varying levels of financial access. Findings The results show that both financial access and financial depth are positive to growth. However, the marginal impact of financial depth is negative at low levels of financial access, while the finance-growth relationship becomes positive at higher levels of financial access. Results suggest the importance of developing inclusive financial systems that emphasise quality rather than quantity to promote economic growth. Research limitations/implications The major limitation lies in the measurement of financial access as it focusses more on financial system penetration and overlooks the other aspects of financial inclusion such as financial literacy and cultural differences. Practical implications Developing countries should continue to develop an inclusive financial system that supports the Universal Financial Access 2020 initiative. Originality/value This study provides further empirical evidence on the finance-growth literature focussing on the impact of financial inclusion which is scarce. Furthermore, the study employs an index of finance that captures the multidimensional nature of finance.

TI  - Determinants of financial inclusion in Afar Region: Evidence from selected woredas
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This paper examined the determinants of financial inclusion in Afar Region. To address the objectives of the study, two purposively selected woredas (Awash and Asaita) and one city administration (Samara-logia) were used. Three hundred and eighty-four sample households were selected for this study. Data collected from administered structured questionnaires were analyzed using the binary logistic regression model. The results show that age, use, financial literacy, and mobile banking are positively and significantly related to financial inclusion. On the other hand, barrier and income negatively and significantly affect financial inclusion. The study results reveal that 31.25% of households were included and 68.75% of households are excluded from formal financial services. Further results show that barriers to financial inclusion such as problem of access to credit, absence of collateral, interest rate, lack of literacy, lack of internet access, lack of trust for financial institutions, lack of money, problem of access to bank branches and ATMs are main obstacles of financial inclusion in Afar region. This study recommends that government and financial institutions should encourage financial service providers, offer fiscal incentives or request financial institutions and serve poor or low-income people. Financial institutions should adopt technologies that ensure financial services are more accessible such as mobile banking. Moreover, households should enhance the saving habits that are helpful to increase amount of income and the literacy level of their children for the best use of financial services.

TI  - Entrepreneurial growth intention and capability approach in agriculture: lesson from Sri Lanka
T2  - SOUTH ASIAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS STUDIES
AB  - Purpose It is imperative to offer a new perspective of Entrepreneurial Growth Intention (EGI) that draws directly upon the capability approach. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of capabilities in the context of EGI in the floriculture industry in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach The study was exploratory and is mainly qualitative in nature. In-depth interviews were carried out with the owners of farms who possess experience in floriculture commercial cultivation in Sri Lanka. Findings The results emerged that there are different perspectives among farm owners regarding EGI. Drawing attention on the stories of our participants and making a three-phase analysis, we identified 31 key actions denoted by the farm owners. This work then suggests that the seven capabilities might be fruitfully framed around EGI. Research limitations/implications As the results stress the role of capabilities in the formation of an entrepreneur's growth intention is vital. Therefore, more targeted measures should be drawn to build fair and supportive facilities to obtain advanced knowledge, to familiarise with the emergence of technology and to attain professional services specifically in financial literacy. Originality/value The question of what factors influence EGI at the farm level is still largely unexplored as less is known about the effect of capabilities on EGI. The study expands the current debates on EGI and institutional environment, which allows the mapping out of capability development.

TI  - Business acumen for nursing leaders: An exploratory qualitative study
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT
AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to explore the status of and need for business acumen of nurse leaders. Background Health systems globally continue to reform to deliver better care while working within sustainable budgets. However, beyond leadership and management expertise, nurse leaders need strong business acumen to appreciate the complexity of the system. Method Two groups, emerging nurse leaders and established health system leaders, were interviewed for their perspective on four elements related to business acumen. Results Business in healthcare was defined and therefore valued with variation across both groups. Adequate business education for nurse leaders was considered lacking by both groups. Inconsistent business acumen was seen as a barrier for nursing inclusion at the system level. Conclusions Business acumen is a skillset more valuable for the nursing profession than the current educational preparation allows, creating a reputational barrier for nursing's full participation in health system-level leadership, but is considered an opportunity for the future. Implications for Nursing Management Improving the foundation business acumen across the nursing profession will not only raise the profile of nurse leader capability to input and influence across the health system but also improve the wider nursing team's understanding around nurse leader advocacy and decision making.

TI  - TRENDS IN FINANCIAL SECURITY RESEARCH: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - Achieving financial security becomes one of the main tasks of the government, business management, investors and citizens. However, at the same time, the very comprehen-sion of the essence of such security is ambiguous, as well as the mechanism for achiev-ing it. The purpose of the article is to identify the trends and key areas of financial security research by conducting a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications that are indexed in the Scopus database. A thorough review of the evolution of financial security research was conducted from 1951 to March 2023. 2,515 publications indexed in the Scopus that contain the term "financial security" in their titles, abstracts and keywords were analyzed. The VOSviewer software was used to build network maps of the rela-tionship between keywords, visualize the relationships between scholars from different countries, and build a network map of the relationship between keywords in chronolog-ical order. The results showed that since the beginning of the 90s of the 20th century, the number of publications on financial security has been increasing annually; the term "financial security" is used in the research of various fields of science; the majority of publications on financial security appeared between 2014 and 2020. The leadership of such research belongs to the USA, the United Kingdom and China. Visualization of the network map of common words based on bibliographic data allowed us to single out 11 clusters that characterize the key areas of financial security research. The following keywords were identified in each cluster: employment security, financial efficiency and stability, life safety, financial risks, social security, financial technologies, psychological state, economic security, family and personal security, financial literacy, and the covid-19 pandemic. The obtained results will contribute to a better understanding of global trends by researchers as well as promote future research in the field of financial security.

TI  - Acceptability of residential licences as quasi-land ownership documents: Evidence from Tanzania
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Most of the property owners in developing countries particularly those residing in informal settlements do not have formal land ownership documents, which weakens security of tenure and denies them access to credit. In addressing the problem, various initiatives have been taken but some of them have not been very effective. This paper uses a case example of an upgraded informal settlement in Tanzania to assess acceptability of residential licences as quasi-land ownership documents among property owners and lending institutions. Findings show that security of tenure, access to credit, property value enhancement, land conflict resolution and guarantee for compensation are the main factors that attract property owners to apply for residential licences. On the other hand, short life span of residential licences, exposure to multiple taxation and land rent, complex application procedure and lack of knowledge on residential licence uses are the main factors accounting for low residential licence application. Findings also show that some property owners do not use residential licences as collateral due to low financial literacy and fear of losing property in case of loan default. Although findings also show that many banks accept residential licences as collateral, it is also clear that having a residential licence without owning a business or having a regular income stream is not enough for a property owner to qualify for a loan because lenders are more interested in borrowers' ability to service the loan rather than mere possession of a land title or its equivalent. Knowledge of these factors is important in devising appropriate interventions that, apart from placing much emphasis on formal land ownership documents, take on board all key factors that hinder land owners from effectively utilising their land for capital and income generation.

TI  - Path to achieving SDG 8: do worker remittances reduce vulnerable employment?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - PurposeThe prevalence of high levels of vulnerable employment in developing countries poses a formidable obstacle to their progress towards achieving SDG 8. While worker remittances (remittances) are widely recognised as a potential source of improving the welfare of people experiencing poverty, their effectiveness in alleviating vulnerable employment from a macro perspective remains unclear. Consequently, the study examines the impact of remittances on reducing vulnerable employment.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses macro-level data from 73 developing countries covering 1990-2021. Vulnerable employment is measured in three forms: total, male, and female. Remittances are measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product. The findings are empirically analysed using dynamic panel data estimation techniques. A two-stage least squares (IV 2SLS) approach addresses remittance endogeneity.FindingsTwo key findings emerge from the study. First, increased remittances are associated with a decline in the total share of workers resorting to vulnerable employment, albeit a modest decline. Second, the remittance surge is associated with more males than females leaving vulnerable employment, indicating its gender-specific effects. These findings remain robust to several checks.Practical implicationsThe study's findings underscore the potential of leveraging remittances to reduce vulnerable employment. To this end, selective and targeted policy interventions that promote financial literacy and inclusion, which serve as the cornerstones for effectively utilising remittances, are advised.Originality/valueTo the best of my knowledge, this study is the first to examine the impact of remittances on vulnerable employment on a macro scale. As such, the study makes a novel contribution to understanding how remittances serve as an enabler for SDG 8.

TI  - SMARTPHONE ACTIVITIES IN PREDICTING TENDENCY TOWARDS ONLINE FINANCIAL SERVICES
T2  - EKONOMSKI VJESNIK
AB  - Purpose: Considering the rapid progress of information and communication technology (ICT) and its influence on daily life, it is inevitable that its impact will also be visible in the financial sector, especially through efforts to present digital financial services as widely as possible and bring them closer to potential users. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate university students' smartphone activities, their use and attitudes towards digital financial services, and to build a neural network model capable of distinguish-ing students according to their awareness of the benefits related to using online financial services.
   Methodology: An online questionnaire was applied to collect data on students' smartphone activity and their tendency to use online financial services. Depending on the variable type, the Kruskal-Wallis H test and Kendall's tau-b were used to assess the association between variables, while multilayer perceptron and radial basis function neural networks were used for the creation of the optimal model.
   Results: Participants in this study achieved an average score of 6.56 (SD = 1.27) for smartphone activity, and the results showed that the optimal neural network model obtained had an overall accuracy of 70.73%. However, smartphone activity did not have an excessive effect on the efficiency of this model.
   Conclusion: The obtained neural network model and its sensitivity analysis managed to reveal some hid-den patterns which could be beneficial to educators in terms of improvements of students' digital and financial literacy as well as to the financial sector in terms of increasing performance and interest of this population in digital financial services.

TI  - Financial distress and COVID-19: evidence from working individuals in India
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore the impact of the containment measures during COVID-19 on individuals' finances, financial resilience during such distress and identifying the most financially vulnerable among them. Tracing such impact during the pandemic has been challenging due to a lack of representative data. This paper addresses this gap in the present study. Design/methodology/approach A survey has been conducted using a structured questionnaire containing various items that portray the impact on income, spending, saving, investment, borrowing, insurance and retirement. The sample consists of 699 respondents and purposive and snowball sampling has been used for data collection. The results are presented and analyzed using infographics and frequency distributions. This study conducts an analysis of variance and Chi-square tests for significance. Findings This paper finds a fall in income and limited ability to cope with the current economic conditions. The survey highlights inadequate savings and insurance, weak retirement planning, outstanding loans and under-diversified investments inhibiting financial resilience even among the higher-income group. Particularly, lower-income strata, women and not much educated are most financially vulnerable. Further, no substantial financial benefits have been received from the government and people rely on their usual income sources. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that measures the pandemic's impact on personal finances, especially in connection with a developing economy like India. Policy interventions are critical to the millions for whom financial literacy is required now more than ever.

TI  - An assessment of mortgage loan default propensity in Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Purpose Credit market development requires appropriate credit assessment and default policies. This paper aims to examine the impact of household characteristics on mortgage default, using survey data collected from Ghanaian financial institutions. Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered using semi-structured questionnaires from customers of five universal banks in Ghana. A logistic regression was used to model the determinants of credit default propensity. Findings Contrary to established knowledge, the study shows that females are more likely to default on credit than their male counterparts. This is even more likely if the female is older, unmarried, divorced and financially illiterate and has lower educational attainments. These factors are associated with lower earning capacity, which increases default tendencies. The findings confirm that price instability (typified by excessive movements in inflation and exchange rates in addition to low national savings rate) are adversely linked to credit defaults. Borrower's perception of constraints to credit access (such as collateral requirements, interest rate and loan size) influence credit default. Banks should be encouraged to invest in the financial literacy skills development of their customers to mitigate credit default tendencies. Social implications - The study is of practical value to credit officers and the development of the credit market in Ghana. Anovel model is presented for assessing credit applications and developing credit default policies. Originality/value The research findings have not only expanded the frontiers of literature but also empirically examined the determinants of credit default propensity, which provides a basis for developing and improving credit default policy in the credit market.

TI  - Do bank credit rejection and financial education affect financial self-confidence?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR & RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the determinants of owner manager financial self-confidence. In particular, it estimates the effect of bank credit rejection and financial education (FE) on the financial self-confidence of business owners.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses data from 2004 and 2008 surveys of 2,500 UK small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). An ordered probit estimation is used to measure and assess the effect of bank credit rejection and FE variables on financial self-confidence for the two periods. The authors also explore potential differences in self-confidence between males and females.
   Findings - The results show that outright bank credit rejection reduces financial self-confidence among owner managers whereas partial bank credit rejection is found to help boost confidence prior to the financial crisis. There is strong evidence that FE increases financial self-confidence. Finally, the authors find no association between gender and reported self-confidence in finance.
   Research limitations/implications - Entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs are encouraged to explore financial literacy and knowledge with a view to increasing their financial self-confidence. This will help SMEs to deal with the banks or other finance providers more efficiently. In addition, better application procedures and information on lending criteria may help SMEs to minimize the probability of bank credit rejection. So the current study has implications for professional bodies as well. The study, however, is restricted to sole proprietor and partnership SMEs and in the UK context only.
   Practical implications - Financial self-confidence has a progressive effect on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial venture growth. The financial self-confidence of owner managers can support their entrepreneurial capability in starting and operating one or more businesses. As entrepreneurs successfully start and operate their own businesses, they are contributing to economic development through job creation, employment and tax contribution.
   Originality/value - This paper makes an original contribution in highlighting the usefulness of FE in boosting financial self-confidence among entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs. It is also found that the experience of bank credit rejection reduces entrepreneurs' financial self-confidence.

TI  - Developing a framework for assessing sustainable banking performance of the Indian banking sector
T2  - SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose Sustainable development has now been recognised as the pivot around which development activities should revolve. Banking is an important component in the same and adoption of sustainable banking practices by various banking institutions is a strong driver to achieve sustainable development. The purpose of this paper is to study the level of adoption of sustainable banking tools and the extent to which banking institutions practice the same in India. In addition, the banking institutions have been ranked and categorised on basis of their sustainable banking performance. Design/methodology/approach The proposed framework focuses on the environmental and social conduct of the banks, who address the issues of sustainability in Indian banking sector. As there is a difference in the economic standards of developed and developing countries, the review of literature helps to figure out the gap in specific frameworks for assessing sustainable banking practices in developing countries. Previous researchers have made an attempt to develop a general framework for assessing the sustainable banking efforts of the banking sector. These studies fall short of indicators on the social dimension of sustainability specifically in the context of less developed countries like India, the social dimensions are is equally a major thrust area along with environmental indicators. Content analysis technique has been used to evaluate sustainable banking performance of the banks and Mann-Whitney U test used to determine the differences in sustainable banking performance of the banks in India. Findings In Indian banking sector, the adoption of the international sustainability code of conduct is still in its nascent stage. The research indicates that sustainability issues which are of the highest priority for the banks are directly related to their business operations such as financial inclusion, financial literacy and energy efficiency, and banks are more focussed on addressing social dimension of sustainability in banking rather than important dimensions of sustainable banking, namely, environmental management, development of green products and services and sustainability reporting. Originality/value This is one of the first studies evaluating the sustainable banking performance of the Indian banking sector.

TI  - Role of Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme in Financial Inclusion: A Study of Farm Households
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Financial inclusion is a critical issue for a country's social and economic development. Since the early twenty century, the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of India has taken various steps for financial inclusion, especially for rural area namely customer service centers, credit counseling centers, and the Kisan Credit Card (KCC). The present study was carried out to determine the effect of the Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme on farm households in both states Haryana and Punjab. We selected a total number of 240 respondents equally from both states. In this study, the researchers analyzed the age-wised perception of farmers and their impact on farm households, which have been playing a key role in the development of the agriculture base. The researchers have found that 30.40% of farmers were thinks positively about the KCC scheme in the age group of 31-40 years in both states. KCC scheme has been found very useful for an agricultural loan or crop loan. The significant differences in the perception of farm households toward the KCC scheme between both states have not been found.

T2  - OECONOMIA COPERNICANA
AB  - Research background: Improving business conditions and SME development are signs of a country's macroeconomic stability. The issue of identifying and removing barriers to the development of firms in the SME segment is a priority in all countries with developed economies and its importance is currently increasing.
   Purpose of the article: The main aim of this paper is to explore possible differences in entrepreneurs' perception of the business environment based on the industry in which the company operates. The analysis contains also a national view, where a comparison between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic is performed.
   Methods: Correspondence analysis was used to achieve the research objectives in order to examine the relations between the categorical variables. Its application is beneficial in cases where the graphic output is clearer than the numerical one.
   Findings & Value added: The presented research makes it possible to identify problematic aspects of doing business in each sector and to create support mechanisms for the creation of effective structural policies. Entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic's Production and Transport sectors agree with the statement that the business environment in the country is suitable for starting a business. As for business environment's suitability for doing business, neither Slovak nor Czech entrepreneurs sector-wide agreed with the given statement. Czech entrepreneurs from the Services, Trade and Construction sectors,respectively, agree, fully agree with the statement that the business environment in the country is reasonably risky and allows for doing business. In the case of entrepreneurs from Slovakia, no significant correspondence is observed. Findings regarding the statement that the business conditions in the country have improved over the past five years are the following: In the Czech Republic, there is a perfect correspondence of the Transport sector and the agreement with the given statement. In the Slovak Republic, agreement was found with the given statement in the Transport sector and neutral position in the Production sector.

TI  - Crypto household behavior and experience during COVID-19
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Many households struggled both physically and financially during the COVID-19 crisis. In a time of such uncertainty, one might expect households to respond differently to financial instruments considered risker than others. Given the nature and general feelings around cryptocurrency, we expected there might be differences in how households that owned cryptocurrencies fared during the COVID-19 crisis as compared to those that did not own cryptocurrency. Our research found that cryptocurrency-owning households reported fewer financial challenges during the pandemic than households that did not own cryptocurrency. Specifically, they were less likely to experience food insecurity or miss payments on a variety of bills, including medical expenses and utilities. Crypto households experienced less unemployment, as both the head of the household and the partner more readily adapted to working from home. Crypto households were also less likely to experience death from COVID-19 than their counterparts were. Data from the Federal Reserve's 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) reveal that cryptocurrency-owning households in fact fared better than those who did not. The linear probability model results hold after correction for data imputation and controlling for financial literacy, willingness to take risks in the short- and long-term, income, wealth, gender, age, education level, work status, and race. These findings suggest a counternarrative to the mainstream opinion of cryptocurrency owners as risk-loving, irrational, retail day traders. This research contributes to the overall literature by showing households working with cryptocurrency make financially savvy decisions and are better off generally than their counterparts.
   As cryptocurrency continues to gain traction and assuming it grows at current rates, society will be greatly affected. First, more households may consider expanding their portfolios with cryptocurrency. Assuming this occurs, more individuals and companies will need to become more familiar with this risky asset and other mechanisms through which one can invest in crypto assets, such as exchange-traded funds. Second, cryptocurrency usage is not only increasing among households but businesses too, including public companies. Investors may want to review their other investments, particularly stocks, to see how they may be indirectly invested in cryptocurrency. This consideration may affect other investment motivation considerations in the impact investing space. Last, we demonstrated households had different experiences with the COVID-19 shock event. Individuals may consider cryptocurrency as another asset to diversify in moving forward depending on other potential shock events besides pandemics, such as global or regional recessions or country currency changes in international markets due to political risk.

TI  - The WALLET Study: Examining Early Memory Loss and Personal Finance
T2  - INNOVATION IN AGING
AB  - Background and Objectives This feasibility study tests a new approach for assessing personal finance in older persons with early memory loss. The project examines 2 primary outcomes that gauge the financial viability and well-being of older adults: wealth loss and financial exploitation. The overall objective is to determine the association of financial literacy and management, financial decision-making, and cognition with wealth loss and financial exploitation. Research Design and Methods This cross-sectional study recruited 46 participants who were 60 years of age or older. Participants were classified as having mild cognitive impairment, perceived cognitive impairment, or no cognitive impairment. The study coordinator arranged with each participant to obtain copies of their main checking account statements for 12 consecutive months within the previous 2 years and, if appropriate, credit card statements. All statements were de-identified and assigned a random ID number. Participants then completed 2 telephone interviews. Results The average participant age was 72 years (standard deviation [SD] = 7.7); 84% were female, 39% White, and 35% currently married. Average education was 16.2 years (SD = 2.4); mean yearly household income was almost $42,000 (SD = 25,752); and monthly social security payments averaged $1,446 (SD = 1,244). Our results indicate that the methods used to analyze checking account statements, followed by telephone interviews to verify identified trends, were useful in developing a financial behavior index to measure wealth loss. Discussion and Implications We demonstrate an alternative method for assessing personal finance using person-centered principles, which we believe are critical in the presence of diminished or impaired cognition. Our findings offer an innovative method for assessing the risk for wealth loss and financial exploitation.

TI  - Discriminating factors in financial risk tolerance: investors' economic perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to identify the variables responsible for classifying the investors into risk takers (RT) and risk avoiders (RA) across their economic perspectives.Design/methodology/approachThe research offers a novel and unobtrusive measure of classifying investors into RT and RA based on a set of financial risk tolerance (FRT) questions. The authors have investigated the causes of discrimination across economic perspectives over a sample of 552 investors exposed to market risk.FindingsThe authors identify that out of the total of 11 risk assessment variables, only three are responsible for classifying investors into RA and RT. The variables are risk return trade-off, comfort level dealing with risk, and understanding short-term volatility. Financial literacy is considered as an emerging cause of discrimination. Further, the authors highlight the most striking finding to be the discriminating factors across wealth and source of income of the investors.Originality/valueExisting research on FRT can be loosely segregated into three groups: the relationship between an individual's financial and non-FRT, estimation of FRT score (FRTS), and perceived self-assessed FRTS. The current research roughly falls into the third category of study where the authors have not only studied the self-assessed risk tolerance but also evaluated the predictors. Most of the studies have focussed on estimating self-assessed FRT with the help of one direct question to the respondent. However, the uniqueness of this study is that the researchers have used an instrument comprising a series of direct and indirect questions that can easily estimate the self-assessed risk perception and also discriminate the role of the economic factors that have any impact on self-assessed FRTS.

TI  - Bridging the Digital Divide: Unraveling the Determinants of FinTech Adoption in Rural Communities
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - Bridging the digital divide between urban and rural communities is critical for expanding financial inclusion. The purpose of this study is to understand the key factors driving the adoption of financial technology (FinTech) applications among rural residents. A conceptual framework is built on the basis of the technology acceptance model, along with the incorporation of innovation awareness and financial awareness. The relationships between factors are empirically validated using a structural equation modeling approach based on survey data from a sample of 386 respondents in rural communities. The results indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, innovation awareness, and financial awareness can positively and significantly affect the intention to adopt FinTech applications. In addition, perceived usefulness mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention. Practical implications for promoting FinTech adoption in rural areas are discussed.
   We investigate the key factors driving the adoption of financial technology (FinTech) applications among rural residents. The findings reveal that: (1) The extended TAM model is suitable for studying FinTech adoption in a rural context. (2) Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, innovation awareness, and financial awareness positively and significantly affect the intention to adopt FinTech applications. (3) Perceived usefulness mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention. We suggest that policymakers can offer education and training programs to improve financial literacy and financial awareness, promoting the use of FinTech products. FinTech products should be simple to use and navigate for rural residents who might not be as tech-savvy. It is important to foster a culture of innovation in rural areas by providing incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation.

TI  - Business acumen for nursing leaders, optional or essential in today's health system? A discussion paper
T2  - COLLEGIAN
AB  - Background: Over the last number of years, the healthcare system has become more complex in managing increasing costs and outcomes within a defined budget. To be effective through reform, especially moving forward from the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare leaders, specifically in nursing, have an increased need for business acumen beyond traditional leadership and management principles. Aim: This paper examines the concept of business acumen in the profession of nursing, specifically for managers and higher nurse leaders, establishing whether these skills are optional or essential. Discussion: Nurses learn and develop broad skills in leadership and management, but less specifically about business or the broader system. With a contemporary Australian health system aiming to be more effective, nurses may require a greater level of business acumen to adequately understand the mechanics of business decision making in the system when designing care models, as well as representing the business potential of nursing in balance with clinical outcomes through reform. Conclusion: The modern nurse, in addition to clinical skills, may need a foundational understanding of business evolving throughout their career, to maximise innovative growth across the system, in meeting the healthcare needs of our community now and into the future. Without a foundation level of business acumen and an understanding of the system across the profession, nurses may not be empowered with their full potential of being a strong voice influencing health system reform.

TI  - Impact of an integrated youth skill training program on youth livelihoods: A case study of cocoa belt region in Ghana
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper assesses the impact of an integrated skills training program given to youth aged 17-25-year old living under the $2/day poverty line in the cocoa belt region of Ghana. Despite being a leading producer of cocoa and having a burgeoning youth population, it is estimated that the average age of a cocoa farmer in Ghana is greater than 50 years. To introduce young people to cocoa farming and address the potential barriers they face in order to do that; a multi-faceted skills training programme was designed with the ultimate aim of improving and diversifying youth livelihoods. The training had three key components: i) cocoa academies (which includes agricultural practices; life skills and financial literacy); ii) business incubators (including entrepreneurial training, networks, mentoring) and iii) supporting enabling environment (access to land and finance). Combining quasi-experimental methods Propensity Score Matching with Difference in Differences, we estimate the causal effect of the programme on agricultural outcomes (farming, agricultural practices), financial behaviour outcomes (saving practices, mobile banking) and livelihood outcomes (employment, income, poverty likelihood) one year after the completion of training. The results of the impact evaluation suggest that compared to the control group (youth nonparticipants), youths who participated in the training adopt better agricultural practices (26 percentage points (pp)), cultivate cocoa (24 pp), and are more likely to engage in farming (22 pp). We also find a 28.7% increase in income in the last seven days and hours worked by 12.4%. Youth also increase the use of banks for saving (16 pp), save using mobile money (6.7 pp), the use of Village Savings and Loan Associations (1.7 pp) and, in general, the use of mobile money for both sending and receiving transfers (10.6 pp). The sex-disaggregated sub-sample analysis provides other valuable insights on the intervention.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - In the interest of saving: Refugee-led microfinance in Kampala, Uganda
T2  - DEVELOPMENT POLICY REVIEW
AB  - Motivation While livelihoods are increasingly promoted for refugees in long-term situations of displacement, refugees can rarely access microfinance loans-the very start-up capital generally considered necessary for creating businesses. Yet across Kampala, Uganda, refugees meet to place small amounts of money into group savings and take out and repay microloans.
   Purpose This article sheds light on this underexplored phenomenon through an empirical study of refugee-led microfinance groups in Kampala and an overview of the existing local landscape of refugee-serving organizations and microfinance institutions providing loans. We analytically reflect on the role of trust in executing microfinance programmes both for and by refugees.
   Approach and Methods We conducted snowball and purposive sampling, semi-structured qualitative interviews, focus group discussions, and non-participant observation.
   Findings Our study found that refugee-led microfinance groups have created a loan structure that is successful for refugees-because it was developed by refugees-with low default rates. This success is underpinned by strong community trust between members. These groups access vulnerable populations important to humanitarian organizations, including women, single mothers, unregistered refugees and the very poor. However, despite filling an important gap in livelihoods assistance-the provision of business capital-refugee-led microfinance groups lack large amounts of capital to loan members, and do not feel they provide adequate business, livelihoods and financial literacy trainings.
   Policy Implications Our findings suggest that non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should support existing groups through offering safe spaces to hold meetings, and with financial and business trainings. Debunking stereotypes of refugees held by financial providers, and advocating for refugees' financial rights remains crucial. Providing loan capital to groups to enable members to take out larger loans may offer another means of support, but collaboration between formal microfinance institutions or NGOs and refugee-led groups must reinforce rather than devalue the networks of trust that contribute to grassroots savings and loan groups' success.

TI  - Personal characteristics and risk tolerance in a natural experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE
AB  - Purpose This paper examines students' decisions when playing an in-class version of the TV game, Deal or No Deal (DOND), to study the relation between personal characteristics and individual decision-making under risk. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzes DOND game play data collected from 374 students in 13 university finance classes, and their personal characteristics collected in a post-game survey. It uses ordered probit, OLS and probit regression analysis to examine the impact of personal characteristics on an individual's risk tolerance. Findings The key finding is that international students are significantly more risk averse than US domestic students. Additionally, given the natural control for age and education, the study finds that gender, race and religion have a limited impact on an individual's risk tolerance. Finally, the study provides evidence that the structure of the DOND game, in general, rewards risk-taking as long as it is not excessive. Once participant behavior becomes risk-seeking, the correlation between risk-taking and game payoff becomes negative. Research limitations/implications The homogeneous set of contestants (business students) analyzed in this study presents some limitations yet provides opportunities to examine risk tolerance differences between the US and international students, and whether gender, race or religious affiliation has an impact on the level of risk tolerance given a natural control for age and education level. Practical implications The evidence suggests that culture and environmental unfamiliarity may impact an individual's risk tolerance. This finding is useful when providing financial advice to diverse clients or when conducting international business. Additionally, understanding that education and financial literacy reduces differences in risk tolerance across gender, race and religion can impact the way we interact with others. A broader practical implication for all investors is that, while under normal circumstances, risk-taking is rewarded with a higher expected return, excessive risk-taking may harm their investment performance. Originality/value This paper utilizes a unique data set, collected through a class activity and post-class survey. While there have been empirical studies using DOND data, this is the first study that examines the impact of personal characteristics on game participants' behavior, thereby generating unique findings not reported in previous studies employing DOND data.

TI  - Credit counselling: a contemporary strategy for survival of micro small and medium-sized enterprises in under-developed financial markets post COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - PurposeThe main purpose of this paper is to establish the mediating effect of credit counselling in the relationship between access to microcredit and survival of micro small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa post COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda.Design/methodology/approachStructural equation modelling (SEM) through SmartPLS 4.0 was used to generate the standardized parameters to test whether credit counselling mediates the relationship between access to microcredit and survival of MSMEs in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa post COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda.FindingsThe SEM bootstrap results revealed that credit counselling enhances access to microcredit by 27% to promote survival of MSMEs in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa post COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda.Research limitationsThe current study focused only on women MSMEs. Future studies may possibly collect data from all the MSMEs to draw better generalization of the findings within the sector.Practical implicationsThe findings can help public finance policy to ensure provision of credit counselling to microentrepreneurs who borrow from different financial institutions to reduce the problem of loan defaults and delinquency rampant in lending. This could be done through conducting routine business education and counselling sessions for microentrepreneurs who often need credit to grow their businesses.Originality/valueThis study is amongst the first few studies to establish the mediating effect of credit counselling in the relationship between access to microcredit and survival of MSMEs in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda. There is a dearth in literature and theory on the rehabilitative and preventive role of credit counselling in reducing repayment defaults amongst borrowers within the credit market to spur survival of MSMEs seen as the main enabler of economic growth, especially in developing countries. In fact, credit counselling acts as a safety net by substituting financial literacy and education to solve the rampant problem of overindebtedness amongst borrowers who are debt illiterate within the credit market.

TI  - Development and validation of an individual entrepreneurial potential new measurement scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - PurposeAs good as existing measurements of entrepreneurial potential (EP) may appear in the literature, they are fragmented, suffer from the lack of theory integration and clarity, are inadequately specified and assessed and the dimensions are unordered by importance. These limitations of EP metrics have hindered entrepreneurial practice and theory advancement. There is a risk of atomistic evolution of the topic among "siloed" scholars and room for repetitions without real progress. The purpose of this paper was to take stock of existing measurements from which the authors developed a new instrument that is brief and inclusive. Design/methodology/approachThe authors followed several steps to develop and validate the new instrument, including construct domain name specification, literature review, structured interviews with entrepreneurs, face validation by experts, semantic validation and statistical validation after two waves of data collected on employee and entrepreneur samples. FindingsA clear operational definition of EP is proposed and serves as a starting point towards a unified EP theory. The new EP instrument is made up of 34 items classified into seven dimensions, which in order of importance are proactive innovativeness, management skill, calculated risk-taking, social skill, financial literacy, entrepreneurial competencies prone to cognitive and heuristic biases and bricolage. The authors provide evidence for reliability and validity of the new instrument. Research limitations/implicationsAlthough a model is not the model, the authors discuss several ways in which the new measurement model can be used by different stakeholders to promote entrepreneurship. Originality/valueThe authors discuss the domain representativeness of the new scale and argue that the literature can meaningfully benefit from a non-fuzzy approach to what makes the EP of an individual. By developing a new EP instrument, the authors set an important pre-condition for advancing entrepreneurial theory and practice.

TI  - Bank Employee Perceptions of Corporate Social Responsibility Practices: Evidence from Egypt
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study examined bank employee perceptions regarding corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices in Egypt as a developing country. In particular, it explored bank employee perceptions towards the CSR aspects on which banks should focus. It also investigated whether factors such as bank type (i.e., public or private), employee age, experience, job position, and number of CSR training programs undertaken can affect this perception. Data were gathered through a questionnaire distributed to both public and private bank employees. The final sample consisted of 127 employees. SPSS was used to analyse the data. We found that bank employees placed different importance on the CSR aspects on which banks should focus. In particular, they prioritized employment and workplace-related aspects such as operational efficiency, financial literacy, equal employment opportunities, and workplace safety. In contrast, they placed less emphasis on environment-related aspects such as greenhouse gas emission and energy consumption. We also found that bank type, age, employee experience, job position, and number of CSR training programs undertaken could affect the perceptions of bank employees regarding the CSR aspects on which banks should focus. While there is a growing stream of research on CSR, prior research lacks CSR practices in developing markets, especially in the banking sector. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to look at the importance and priorities of CSR aspects in Egypt-one of the fastest-growing economies in the developing world. Based on the findings of this study, policymakers and regulators in Egypt such as the Central Bank of Egypt and the Egyptian Banking Institute are advised to request banks to pay more attention to environmental-related aspects of CSR to keep pace with Egypt 2030 vision and develop an action plan that helps increase bank employee awareness regarding the importance of CSR practices and engage employees further in developing their banks' sustainability strategy.

TI  - Qualitative inquiry suggesting needed pathways: economic, social, religious, political and industrial an activist research on poverty
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThe existing gaps and knowing about the truth inspired the researchers to select this area and to know more about various initiatives taken for their liberation by an individual self-propagating effort, the faith-based communities, the government, the organizations dealing with educationalists as researchers, banking, media and the revealing role of women in handling poverty concerns.Design/methodology/approachThe current study is compiled after the review of seventy-seven research articles. This study adopted a descriptive research design essentially because it appears more appropriate for the study. Data were collected mainly through the secondary sources such as electronic databases like Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, Google Scholars. The study is conducted through a qualitative approach.FindingsHence based on the extensive literature review and its synthesis, this research work explores the meaning of poverty, its effects, root cause, measurement tools, associated theories and models and stakeholders' role in poverty alleviation.Research limitations/implicationsThis study reflects that there is a huge gap in designing standardized tools that can bring more income equality, ethics in operations, cooperation and environmental sustainability.Practical implicationsFor poverty alleviation, individuals need to work towards perfection and improving their own skill sets. Leading Faith groups encouraging individuals about their divine duties to help the poor community and promote debt forgiveness. Government provides funds to develop certain tools and app that can help in checking the distribution of wealth. Banks to introduce flexible microcredit scheme education sector need to develop more financial literacy and innovative thinking courses. Social media and Information communications technology (ICT) provide connectivity services with high affordability.Social implicationsPoverty will remain be an ongoing societal challenge if not handled by various stakeholders strategically by contributing in their own fields with their unique ideas.Originality/valueThe proposed idea explained through qualitative inquiry promotes compassion and hope needed for poverty alleviation through various stake holders.

TI  - Adoption of the Green Economy through Branchless Rural Credit Banks during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - A green economy has an impact on improving welfare, but it takes continuous efforts to achieve it from various fields. Contribution in the context of banking on a small scale is one of the initiatives that can show participation in achieving a green economy. This study aims to explore people's behavior in financial transactions and analyze the practice of rural credit banks in encouraging the achievement of a green economy through the National Financial Inclusive Strategy (NFIS) program despite the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used quantitative approaches; observations were conducted at a certain time by collecting data taken directly as a complement to this study, as well as taking questionnaire data involving 363 samples and analyzing them using the structural equation model (SEM). The result is that green economic support is found in using paper for fewer savings transactions compared to branchless banking with conventional savings transactions. The high number of residents exposed to COVID-19 does not affect branchless banking. In addition, the use of branchless banking can show the penetration of financial literacy in the community. The results of the path analysis explain that perceived ease of use (7.468) and perceived usefulness (2.152) have an influence on attitude; intention is greatly influenced by attitude (15.357); and actual usage is influenced by intention (11.682). This research has specific implications for the Magelang City Rural Bank (MCRB), which needs to conduct market research to find out the potential of branchless banking that is specifically needed by the people of Magelang. Branchless banking innovation needs to be strengthened by presenting easy-to-understand and easy-to-use applications to improve the attitude of the Magelang people in adopting branchless banking applications and using them sustainably.

TI  - Differences in financial inclusion by disability type
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to determine the nature of financial inclusion for individuals with various types of disabilities.Design/methodology/approachData from 2015, 2017 and 2019 FDIC Survey of Household Use of Banking and Financial Services was pooled, and binary logistic regressions were used to investigate differences in barriers to financial inclusion (e.g. unbanked) between people with different types of disabilities (e.g. cognitive) and those without such disabilities.FindingsUsing five separate barrier measures, the authors found specific disability types face different barriers to financial inclusion. For example, respondents with cognitive, ambulatory or two or more disabilities were more likely to use nonbank transaction products and alternative financial services. And, those with vision or cognitive disabilities were more likely to be denied or receive reduced credit. When examining aggregate barriers to financial inclusion (total number of barriers faced) respondents with cognitive, ambulatory, hearing or two or more disabilities experienced the lowest degree of financial inclusion in the authors' dataset.Research limitations/implicationsCausal inference cannot be made due to the cross-sectional nature of the data. The data only covers the US population, and the measurement of disability type could include those with short-term impairments. Further, there may be an omitted variable bias.Practical implicationsBest practices to maximize financial inclusion for those with different disability types should address accessibility issues, bank staff education, financial literacy education and poverty issues. Additional government policies and oversight are also needed to protect and enhance the overall financial inclusion of people with disabilities.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to examine the relationship between various barriers to financial inclusion and aggregate barriers to financial inclusion by disability type. Specific disability types are found to face different barriers to financial inclusion.

TI  - A look into sustainable development goal amidst technological innovation, financial development and natural resources: a symmetry and asymmetry analyses
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Algeria is one of the North African countries endowed with abundant natural resource mostly on oil and gas. Because of its richness in natural resource, most of its economic activities and development (including economic and environment) are dependent and determined by its natural resources. Due to Algeria's rising dependence on natural resource rents, the country's long-term development and environmental policy toward its sustainable development goals (SDGs) have been seriously questioned. For this reason, the objective of this study is to examine the Algeria's sustainable development goals amidst its heavy dependence on natural resources. We applied Algeria's data of 1980 to 2019 with a dual and novel scientific approaches (linear/dynamic ordinary least square-DOLS, and nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag-NARDL) for insightful analysis of this subject. A trio indicator of natural resources, technological innovation and financial development is utilized in this study for a direct overview of their impact on Algeria inclusive sustainable development goals. Findings from the two approaches showed that technological innovation, financial development and natural resources reduce carbon emission and increase economic growth, respectively. Hence, sustainable development goals are achievable for the case of Algeria if policy is framed around innovation, financial development and natural resource. With this, policy framing toward sustainable development goals should focus on increasing technological innovation through financial development which will transcend to improvement on both environment and economic situation of Algeria. Some financial policies such as subsidy from government in financing research projects, and lifting embargo on loan through reduction in interest rate and increase on financial literacy through sensitization on how to go about securing loans are to be considered when framing lasting policies targeting the Algeria's SDGs.

TI  - A qualitative phenomenological exploration of social mood and investors' risk tolerance in an emerging economy
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - Purpose The authors design a theoretical perspective that explores how different phases of social mood influence financial risk tolerance (FRT) among investors. Risk is involved in almost all financial decision-making. For a better understanding of risk tolerance behavior, the role played by social mood cannot be ignored. This study aims to explore the linkage between social mood and FRT of investors in Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach Using qualitative phenomenology as the guiding framework, 22 interviews were conducted to have a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of investors with at least 10 years of investment experience. Thematic analysis was done to analyze data. Audio-recording, bracketing, triangulation and member checking were done to ensure validity and reliability. Findings A theoretical model is developed using the six themes identified through thematic analysis. This model presents an in-depth analysis of the determinants of social mood, its multiple phases and its impact on risk tolerance behavior. Findings reveal that the level of financial literacy, experience and purpose of investment moderate the effect of social mood on FRT. Practical implications Investors can manage risk and increase their profits by controlling the effects of social mood. They can benefit from the market situation by taking more risk when the market is extremely low. The advisors can frame their advice in the light of the model. Originality/value According to the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that explores investors' risk tolerance in response to variations in social mood in the context of an emerging economy. The paper has contributed conceptually and methodologically. It uses phenomenology as the method and develops a theoretical model that describes how different types of investors adjust their risk tolerance in response to changes in their social mood.

TI  - Crowd-funding to promote women entrepreneurship: a systematic literature review of the empirical studies conducted in the last decade (2012-2023)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENDER AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - Purpose - It aims to understand crowdfunding's effect on women's entrepreneurship and summarize key findings, methods, and challenges women face in using crowdfunding for financing. Design/methodology/approach - This literature review examines 36 empirical studies on crowdfunding use by women entrepreneurs. It follows the PRISMA framework, using Scopus and citation tracking to categorize studies on crowdfunding's potential to empower women financially and address their barriers to accessing finance. Findings - The review identified seven key themes: opportunities and challenges for women in crowdfunding, equity crowdfunding's potential, gender differences in crowdfunding outcomes, the role of social capital and networks, investor trust and decision-making, the influence of language, communication, and platform design, and the importance of considering intersectionality and context. Crowdfunding offers women entrepreneurs access to capital and helps them overcome traditional financing barriers. Women-led campaigns achieve comparable or even higher success rates compared to their male counterparts. However, under-representation, lower funding requests, pitching difficulties, and limited access to networks remain as challenges. Research limitations/implications - This study has limitations inherent to systematic reviews, including potential methodological flaws or biases in the included studies and the exclusion of relevant studies due to time and resource constraints. Practical implications - Crowdfunding can be promoted as a viable financing option for women entrepreneurs and design targeted initiatives to support them. Building social capital, enhancing financial literacy, and creating networking opportunities can contribute to their success in navigating crowdfunding platforms effectively. Originality/value - This review offers a comprehensive analysis of empirical studies conducted between 2012 and 2023. It provides up-to-date insights, identifies key themes, and offers actionable recommendations for policymakers and organizations seeking to support women entrepreneurs in effectively accessing and utilizing crowdfunding platforms.

TI  - An analytical study on the potential investors' perceptions towards reverse mortgage loan in Navi Mumbai Region of Maharashtra State
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - The reverse mortgage loan scheme is a wondrous income option for 'cash poor and home rich' senior citizens during their old age days. The current Indian demographic and socio-economic changes will increase the demand for the product in the next few years. The present study is to identify and understand the Indian potential investors' perception regarding the financial benefits and virtues of reverse mortgage loans in the Indian market scenario. After a decade since inception, Indians are unable to build an explicit opinion about the product. Their major apprehension is of losing the property at the end, which is leading to feeble perception towards the scheme. To make a successful product, the policymakers, and the loan providers should show a broader picture to the potential investors, and the potential investors should grab this opportunity to understand the product. This will be helpful for them to live their post-retirement life independently.

TI  - How Much Financial Development Accentuates Income Inequality in Central and Eastern European Countries?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Financial development is often associated with significant economic growth, but studies have shown that a high level of financial development can be the cause of deepening income inequality in many countries. The main objective of the proposed study is to identify to what extent financial development influences income inequality in Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC). Thus, for the model specification we used as dependent variable the Gini coefficient and as independent variable the financial development index. The sample period for the analysis was from 2004 to 2019, restricted by the lack of data on the Gini coefficient in CEECs. Data on the financial development index were collected from International Monetary Fund, and data on the Gini coefficient were extracted from the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform. The study unravels several contributions. First of all, the use of quantile regression allowed for the examination of the effects of financial development across the entire distribution of income inequality. Second of all, the use of a comprehensive financial development index offered a more robust and comprehensive measure of financial development compared to single indicators. Taking into account that the Gini coefficient must be close to zero, this result was a positive one with, in essence, financial development reducing income inequality in CEECs. Thirdly, the specific focus on CEECs fills a gap in the literature. Finally, the findings of this study have important policy implications. The obtained results indicate a negative causal relationship between financial development and income inequality, emphasizing the fact that the relationship between these two components cannot be generalized for all regions. These might include measures to promote financial inclusion, improve financial literacy, and enhance the stability and efficiency of financial systems. Supporting financial development in CEECs and similar transition economies can be an effective strategy for tackling income inequality.

TI  - Towards an Understanding of FinTech Users' Adoption: Intention and e-Loyalty Post-COVID-19 from a Developing Country Perspective
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Earlier literature has shown that the implementation of FinTech innovations is not only determined by banks, financial institutions, or government support, but also by the perception and experiences of FinTech users. FinTech research has shown encouraging findings from scholars in developed countries. However, little is known about the users' acceptance and use of FinTech in Jordan. The aim of this study is to investigate the determinants of users' intentions and e-Loyalty toward FinTech adoption in Jordan post the COVID-19 era. A conceptual framework was developed by integrating the four original constructs of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), namely performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), and facilitating conditions (FC), with three additional factors: personal innovativeness (PI), financial literacy (FL), and uncertainty avoidance (UA). In addition, the proposed model considered the e-Loyalty of FinTech users as a consequence of having a good FinTech experience. A quantitative approach using a cross-sectional online questionnaire was applied to collect data from 423 FinTech users. Data were analyzed utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM) based on AMOS 26.0 software package. The findings revealed that UA has a moderating effect on the relationship between FC and users' intentions. Also, PI has a significant impact on PE and EE. While PE, SI, and FC are factors that enhance behavioral intentions. In return, it builds users' e-Loyalty toward FinTech services and is deemed a new normal behavior. This study may help FinTech service providers and policymakers better understand the, currently relatively low, usage rate of FinTech, and how it contributes to the development of strategies that boost the acceptance and e-Loyalty of FinTech by Jordanian users after the COVID-19 era, where FinTech is still considered an innovation.

TI  - Mathematical Competence Scale (MCS) for Primary School: The Psychometric Properties and the Validation of an Instrument to Enhance the Sustainability of Talents Development through the Numeracy Skills Assessment
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The adequate development of the numeracy skills is a target of the fourth of the Sustainable Development Goals and is considered the basis for a financial literacy: both are competences needed for successful social and professional inclusion. Building on these goals, we carried out a unidimensional Mathematical Competence Scale (MCS) for primary school. The aim of this study was to present the psychometric properties and the validation process of MCS, designed basing on Item Response Theory. The final version of the scale, which measures different domains of mathematical knowledge (Data Analysis and Relationships, Geometry, Dimensions and Measurements, Numbers and Calculations), was validated on the entire population of 2935 fourth graders in Ticino Canton, Switzerland. The results reveal the high level of correlation between the six mathematical dimensions and confirm the assumption of a latent mathematical construct. However, even the multidimensional model could be considered a good model because it fitted the data significantly better than the one-dimensional model. In particular, the differences of the deviance between the two models are significant ((2) (20) = 642.66, p < 0.001). Moreover, findings show a significant gender effect and a positive correlation between students' actual school performance during the same academic year and MCS scores. MCS allows a reading of the learning and teaching process in the perspective of the psychology of sustainability and sustainable development and helps a teacher to sustain student talent through the development of numeracy skills; in fact, the scale is intended both as an assessment tool and an innovative approach for shaping the development of curriculum, and therefore has potential to serve as a bridge between empirical research, classroom practice and a positive (school and professional) career development.

TI  - Business school education, motivation, and young adults' stock market participation*
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - In this paper, we examine whether business school education increases students' stock market participation. We use unique stock ownership data of students from a business school in Sweden. We find a significant increase in stock ownership during and after their studies at the school compared to before entering the school. The marginal effects are 3.8% for the first two years of the core curriculum, 4.4% for the specialisation year, and 4.3% for the three years following graduation. The positive effect of business education on stock market participation is mainly driven by students interested in accounting or finance subjects, and the effect is more pronounced for females than for male students.

TI  - Feasibility of linking universal child and family healthcare and financial counselling: findings from the Australian Healthier Wealthier Families (HWF) mixed-methods study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Objectives 'Healthier Wealthier Families' (HWF) seeks to reduce financial hardship in the early years by embedding a referral pathway between Australia's universal child and family health (CFH) services and financial counselling. This pilot study investigated the feasibility and short-term impacts of HWF, adapted from a successful Scottish initiative. Methods Setting: CFH services in five sites across two states, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants: Caregivers of children aged 0-5 years experiencing financial hardship (study-designed screen). Design: Mixed methods. With limited progress using a randomised trial (RCT) design in sites 1-3 (March 2020-November 2021), qualitative interviews with service providers identified implementation barriers including stigma, lack of knowledge of financial counselling, low financial literacy, research burden and pandemic disruption. This informed a simplified RCT protocol (site 4) and direct referral model (no randomisation, pre-post evaluation, site 5) (June 2021-May 2022). Intervention: financial counselling; comparator: usual care (sites 1-4). Feasibility measures: proportions of caregivers screened, enrolled, followed up and who accessed financial counselling. Impact measures: finances (quantitative) and other (qualitative) to 6 months post-enrolment. Results 355/434 caregivers completed the screen (60%-100% across sites). In RCT sites (1-4), 79/365 (19%-41%) reported hardship but less than one-quarter enrolled. In site 5, n=66/69 (96%) caregivers reported hardship and 44/66 (67%) engaged with financial counselling; common issues were utility debts (73%), and obtaining entitlements (43%) or material aid/emergency relief (27%). Per family, financial counselling increased income from government entitlements by an average $A6504 annually plus $A784 from concessions, grants, brokerage and debt waivers. Caregivers described benefits (qualitative) including reduced stress, practical help, increased knowledge and empowerment. Conclusions Financial hardship screening via CFH was acceptable to caregivers, direct referral was feasible, but individual randomisation was infeasible. Larger-scale implementation will require careful, staged adaptations where CFH populations and the intervention are well matched and low burden evaluation.

TI  - How to elicit and cease herding behaviour? On the effectiveness of a warning message as a debiasing decision support system
T2  - DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
AB  - Behavioural economics has been argued to be a productive basis for decision support system (DSS) research. Whereas traditional economics assumes that individuals make decisions independently of others, behavioural economists have shown that humans tend to follow the crowd in their decisions (i.e., exhibit herding bias). However, the literature is silent on how convincing the information on the decisions of the crowd needs to be to elicit herding bias and on whether herding can be reduced (i.e., debiased) by presenting a warning message. This paper addresses both questions in the contexts of financial decisions that were guided by two DSSs in the form of simulation tools. In particular, we conduct a randomised controlled trial with 768 respondents randomly assigned to peer information. The results indicate that the intervention successfully elicited herding bias and that herding occurs when respondents are informed that at least 50% of other people made a particular decision. The results further show that a DSS in the form of a warning message is not sufficient to debias herding. In conclusion, these findings showed that individuals are easily influenced by erroneous peer information and that this effect is robust against debiasing using a warning message. Hence, DSS developers need to consider more intense debiasing strategies to overcome herding.

TI  - Understanding sources of financial well-being in Romania: A prerequisite for transformative financial services
T2  - JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which financial behavior and financial well-being are affected by cognitive and non-cognitive factors in a specific Romanian post-communist context. This study shows that financial well-being is significantly linked to both financial education and to a set of non-cognitive factors. This paper offers strategic insights on what financial services should communicate to consumers and how they should be communicated, achieve the mutual benefits of the transformative paradigm.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study uses an online sample of 1,602 participants, representative of the general population in Romania concerning income and education, to collect data on financial anxiety, financial security and financial saving behavior (dependent variables), self-control, optimism, future orientation, deliberative thinking and financial literacy (independent variables). This paper measures the latent constructs - as composite indices, using partial least squares - path modeling. Working with WarpPLS software version 6.0 allows exploration of both linear and non-linear relationships involved in the model, along with their practical and managerial implications.
   Findings
   The results indicate that the key component to address in the development of financial services (in the post-soviet context) is financial anxiety. This study finds that, in contrast to Western countries, in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE), financial education is not always a panacea. Additionally, financial security is not always the most important goal for consumers.
   Practical implications
   This paper suggests managerial recommendations for redefining the relationship between banks and the Romanian population, focused mainly on diminishing financial anxiety and increasing financial security, as key elements of transformative financial services.
   Originality/value
   The study highlights the significant role played by behavioral variables in shaping financial well-being in Romania, being among the very few investigations illustrating the relevance of the topic in post-communist countries. This research shows unique challenges for the design of transformative financial services in a specific (post-communist) setting and provides insights on how financial services marketing can become more effective in the CESEE region.

TI  - An enigma of Malaysia's low-income young adults: Mediation of financial behaviour on financial well-being and locus of control cohesion
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Young adults face many significant challenges to their financial well-being. The rising cost of living and unstable economies have impacted how they consume, manage, and save monthly income to maintain their standard of living. Hence, exploring the financial well-being of young adults in Malaysia is an intriguing and relevant research topic that deserves examination from multiple perspectives. This study aims to investigate how these three factors, namely financial knowledge and locus of control with financial behaviour as a mediator, are correlated with the financial well-being of low-income young adults in Malaysia. A total of 520 young adults from North, Central, South, East zones in Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia were randomly chosen using a multi-stage sampling technique as the sample of this study. Data in this study were obtained using a set of questionnaire-based survey through cross-sectional study and then scrutinized using IBM SPSS (Statistical Package of Social Science). This study discovered that financial knowledge, internal and external locus of control, and financial behaviour were significantly correlated with the financial well-being of low-income young adults. The findings also demonstrate that financial behaviour mediates the correlation between financial knowledge, both internal and external locus of control, and financial well-being. This study is one of the very few important studies that explore the link between financial literacy, locus of control, financial behaviour, and financial well-being among low-income young adults. This study also found an interesting and noteworthy fact regarding the impact of the minimum monthly wage policy on highly educated young adults in Malaysia, which is worth discussing and needs to be alerted to the policymakers and leaders of the country. Therefore, the findings of this study can be utilized as a starting point by policymakers, government organizations, and non-governmental organizations to create new initiatives aimed at raising financial well-being among the younger generation.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF THE BANKING SYSTEM LIQUIDITY ON THE VOLUME OF LENDING AND INVESTMENT IN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DURING THE WAR
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - In the context of escalating military and political uncertainties, a crucial component of banking system stability is the establishment of an adequate level of resource provision - liquidity. The research aims to analyze the transmission impact of the banking system's liquidity and its structure on the volumes of financing for the real sector of the economy in the second year of the war in Ukraine. In the conditions of war and the corresponding intensification of military -political threats and uncertainties, the regulator has made numerous complex decisions and restrictions aimed at balancing the challenges with the current situation in financial markets. The research found that the banking sector of Ukraine currently accumulates a significant amount of excess liquidity and demonstrates high profitability. However, in the conditions of war, the transmission mechanism works improperly, requiring constant intervention from the regulator to balance the liquidity of the banking sector and state finances, which, in turn, affects the behavior of commercial banks and changes the structure of their asset portfolios. An analysis of the structure of active operations portfolios of the banking, corporate, and private sectors provide grounds to assert that there is no reason to expect a change in investment behavior from these groups in the perspective of the next year due to the specificity of the conditions imposed by the Ministry of Finance and the regulator. To maintain macroeconomic stability in the national economy in the conditions of martial law it is necessary to introduce conditions to reduce demand for foreign currency and, as an alternative, offer the preservation of savings solvency through simplifying access to investments in government securities for households. The low financial literacy of the population and the underdeveloped stock market in Ukraine, as well as the more complex mechanism of purchasing government bonds or military bonds compared to deposit services, make such investments by the population insignificant and limited in demand.

TI  - Effective association between audit committees and the internal audit function and its impact on financial reporting quality: Empirical evidence from Omani listed firms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUDITING
AB  - The role of the audit committee in oversight of the internal control and internal audit function has grown in the last decades as corporate governance mechanisms after the dramatic scandals and failures. This paper examines the impact of the audit committee and the presence of internal audit function on a company's financial reporting quality. Moreover, this study focus on the association between the audit committee and internal audit function and company's financial reporting quality measured as accruals quality and absolute discretionary accruals. It is hypothesized that the financial reporting quality is related to the strength of internal corporate governance mechanisms, including audit committee and internal audit and its association. Different mechanisms are being examined: audit committee size and independence, frequency of meeting, financial literacy, existence of internal audit function and its meeting independently. To test our hypothesis, we employ panel data analysis for 71 nonfinancial firms through 139 observations listed on the Muscat Securities Market during the period of 2013 and 2014. The data used in the analysis were collected from the companies' annual reports published by the Muscat Securities Market. Ordinary least squares is used to regress financial reporting quality linear variables on audit committee and internal audit. The findings suggest that audit committee meetings frequency and the presence of internal audit function positively affect a company's financial reporting quality. Hence, an audit committee that meets more frequently provides effective monitoring of financial reporting and increases the likelihood of discussing and following up any problems and findings in the financial statements and audit reports. Thus, frequent audit committee meetings provide better oversight of the annual accounts. Likewise, the internal audit function is considered an important corporate governance mechanism to safeguard the quality of financial reporting by monitoring organizational risks, assessing internal controls and detecting possible manipulation because the internal auditor evaluates financial procedures. However, results suggest that the relationship between other corporate governance mechanisms and financial reporting quality is not significant.

TI  - Cognitive ability and stock market participation: evidence from China
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - PurposeIt is imperative for policymakers, financial institutions, and individual investors to comprehend the factors that impact stock market participation, given the growing significance of the stock market in terms of personal and national wealth. This study endeavours to explore the relationship between cognitive ability and participation in the stock market. We examine the relationship between cognitive abilities and stock market participation, and further explore the mechanism of their influence.Design/methodology/approachThe data from the China Family Panel Studies is utilized, and Tobit and Probit regressions are employed. Additionally, an instrumental variable approach (IV-estimate) is implemented to address the endogeneity issue linked to cognitive ability, and the study's findings are resilient.FindingsThe results reveal a significant positive relationship between cognitive ability and stock market participation. Additionally, the findings suggest that households with higher cognitive ability tend to aggregate more information, expand social networks, and take more risks. A likely explanation is that individuals with higher cognitive ability are more likely to process more external information and evaluate the subjective uncertainty of stock markets based on a well-defined probability distribution. Our findings indicate that the impact of cognitive ability on stock market participation varies among families with differing education levels, genders, marital statuses, and geographical locations.Originality/valueTherefore, the roles of cognitive abilities in accelerating stock market participation should be fully considered. More information channels and sources that contain financial markets' information (e.g. mobile applications and financial education) should be provided. Thus, the significance of cognitive ability in increasing stock market participation should be fully considered. Providing more information channels and sources, such as mobile applications and financial education, that contain financial markets' information would be helpful. Our study contributes to promoting financial literacy and inclusion by highlighting the significant positive impact of cognitive ability, where institutions can tailor their outreach efforts and information channels to better serve individuals with different cognitive ability.

TI  - "MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING"? THE HISTORICAL JOURNEY TOWARDS FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR ZIMBABWE'S LOW-EARNING CONSUMERS
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE LAW
AB  - An investigation into the debt relief measures available to consumer debtors in Zimbabwe reveals that the former and now repealed insolvency statutes did not cater for debtors with smaller estates such as No-Income-No Asset (NINA) debtors. Given the dire state of the Zimbabwean economy due to a multiplicity of economic and political reasons fuelled by other factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, this category of Zimbabwean consumer debtors found themselves in a lifelong debt trap. However, in 2018, Zimbabwe introduced a new Insolvency Act that, among others, provides for a pre-liquidation composition procedure that could benefit those debtors who do not qualify for the liquidation of assets process. Against the backdrop of the historical development and the plight of indigent debtors, the authors consider the new measure and conclude that although being a step in the right direction, it may still provide too little protection for NINA debtors.

TI  - GAMESTOP AND THE REEMERGENCE OF THE RETAIL INVESTOR
T2  - BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
AB  - The GameStop trading frenzy in January 2021 was perhaps the highest profile example of the reemergence of capital market participation by retail investors- a marked shift from the growing domination of those markets by large institutional investors. Some commentators have greeted retail investing, which has been fueled by app-based brokerage accounts and social media, with alarm and called for regulatory reform. The goals of such reforms are twofold. First, critics argue that retail investors need greater protection from the risks of investing in the stock market. Second, critics argue that the stock market, in turn, needs protection from retail investors. This Article challenges calls for broad regulatory reform. It reasons that, although retail investing is likely to impact the capital markets, claims about the harms from increased retail investing are overstated. More importantly, the debate overlooks potential benefits from retail investing, both to investors themselves and the capital markets. Regulators should not clamp down on the conditions, such as commission-free trading, gamified trading platforms, and the expanded use of social media, that have enabled a generation of new investors to participate in the capital markets. These innovations, through their ability to facilitate direct market participation by retail investors, have the potential to democratize the capital markets and increase the connections between ordinary citizens and U.S. businesses. Regulators should instead be focusing on how to facilitate the effectiveness of that process. This Article defends the reemergence of the retail investor and its potential promise in enabling citizen capitalism-providing ordinary citizens with a stake in the nation's productivity while, at the same time, increasing the accountability of those businesses to societal interests. It explains that retail investment can reduce the increasingly problematic power of institutional intermediaries. It also holds the possibility of increasing corporate consideration of stakeholder interests without the need for formal structural changes or heavy-handed regulation. Critically, however, effective citizen capitalism requires retail shareholders to participate in the capital markets on an informed basis. Although the extent to which the GameStop frenzy reflected rational investing behavior is questionable, the frenzy drew retail investors to the market, and there is evidence that retail investment and engagement will both continue and evolve. This Article identifies opportunities to improve the retail investing experience, including greater oversight of sources of investment information, limits on the manipulative use by brokers of customer information, and the extension of fintech innovation to mechanisms for improving financial literacy. Attention to these concerns, rather than heavy-handed efforts to discourage retail investing, will increase the effectiveness of the retail investor.

TI  - NGO responses to financial evaluation: auditability, purification and performance
T2  - ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose Literature has widely studied the financial accountability pressures on NGOs but rarely analysed how NGOs respond to them. This paper studies one large humanitarian NGO to address this question. It investigates the NGO's responses to understand the extent to which NGOs are able to regain control over their own work and turn the frames of evaluation and accountability to their own advantage. Design/methodology/approach This article draws on a case study of one of the largest French humanitarian NGOs. Interviews and observation (both participant and non-participant) were conducted in the financial department of the NGO. These data are supplemented with field-level contextual interviews. Findings In the NGO studied, institutional pressure is largely mediated by compliance audits. The paper thus traces the consequences of compliance audits for the NGO's central finance teams and describes how they respond. The findings detail three responses to evaluation. First, to respond to the burden of evaluation, the organisation makes itself auditable and develops preparedness. Second, to respond to the anxiety of evaluation, the organisation engages in a process of purification and succumbs to the allure of the single figure. Third, building on its newly acquired auditability and purity, the organisation performs itself as a "corporatised NGO". Together, these three responses constitute the NGO as an "entrepreneur" competing for eligibility, and financial literacy and managerialism become crucial to respond to pressure from institutional funders. Originality/value This paper extends the understanding of organisational responses to evaluation. The authors show the influence of evaluation systems on NGOs, but also how NGOs can react to regain control over their work and turn the frames of evaluation and accountability to their own advantage. However, despite several decades of calls for broader conceptions of NGO accountability, the case NGO prefers to promote a very narrow view of its performance, based solely on accounting compliance. It takes some pride in its ability to comply with funders' and auditors' demands. Turning a simple matter of compliance into a display of good performance, it builds a strategy and competitive advantage on its ability to respond competently to evaluation.

TI  - Does IFRS convergence affect the readability of annual reports by Indian listed companies?
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ACCOUNTING RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of IFRS convergence on annual report readability in an emerging market context, with an emphasis on the contents of management discussion and analysis (MD & A), notes to the accounts (Notes) and the whole annual report.Design/methodology/approachThe study performs firm-fixed effect regression on a sample of 143 Indian listed companies over a period spanning from 2012 to 2021 to examine the influence of IFRS convergence on readability. This assessment primarily focuses on broader spectrums of readability dimensions, namely annual report length and complexity, wherein complexity is measured using the Gunning Fog, Flesch Reading ease and Flesch-Kincaid grade index.FindingsAs Indian firms shift to IFRS reporting, the findings suggest that annual reports have become significantly lengthier and more complex, causing deterioration in readability. The Notes section, in particular, exhibits the most significant increase in length and complexity, followed by the entire annual report and MD & A section. Furthermore, the findings also indicate that the complexity of the Notes section is instrumental in the observed complexity growth of the whole annual report in the post-IFRS period.Research limitations/implicationsThe current study employs readability indices rather than directly taking into consideration the opinions of actual users of annual reports to determine readability. As a result, the study does not provide direct evidence on how information in annual reports affects users' readability.Practical implicationsThe findings provide insightful information to managers and policymakers about the difficulties stakeholders may encounter while reading IFRS-based annual reports, which ultimately impact their investment decisions. Thus, there is an important managerial implication from this, depending upon the severity of complexity corporations participate in while complying with IFRS in the post-IFRS period.Originality/valueAnalyzing the influence of exogenous information shock, such as IFRS convergence, on readability is critical, particularly for emerging markets like India, where a lack of financial literacy and weaker enforcement already have detrimental effects on the capital market. In light of this, the current study provides a comprehensive examination of the impact of IFRS convergence on annual report readability and contributes to the growing IFRS literature in the less explored emerging market context.

TI  - The role of self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking and self-control in shaping the financial behavior and financial well-being of young adults
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The sustainable financial behavior and financial well-being have been a key concern among the developing societies; thereby encompassing the various psychological factors which play a role in influencing individual's positive financial behavior and financial well-being, this study is conducted. Research focusing on the psychological aspect of human financial behavior and well-being is scarce, focusing more on the cognitive side such as financial literacy and numeracy. The aim of this research study is to find the role played by the non-cognitive factors such as self-esteem, self-control, optimism and deliberative thinking, in forming the financial behavior and financial well-being of the young adults. A sample of 429 university students from public and private sector was collected via an online and field survey using purposive sampling technique. The survey contained measures for demographics, self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking, self-control, general financial behavior and financial well-being. SPSS and PLS-SEM tools were used for the exploration of the relationships among dependent and independent variables. The results of PLS path analysis demonstrate that among the non-cognitive factors, self-control and deliberative thinking show a significant association with both financial behavior, and financial security. Self-esteem plays no significant role in forming the financial behavior of the young adults when all the variables are taken together but it exhibits a significant association with financial well-being (financial security and financial anxiety). Optimism on the other hand exhibits no significant association with both financial behavior and financial well-being (financial security and financial anxiety). The results of this study complement the previous studies and also put forth new outcomes. This research is unique as it is the first of its kind conducted in a consumption-oriented economy like Pakistan. In addition to the previous studies which have often established the link of self-esteem with general well-being, this study goes further by analyzing the association between self-esteem and financial well-being and by the identification of the role played by non-cognitive factors like self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking and self-control together on the financial behavior and financial well-being of the individuals using PLS-SEM approach.

TI  - CONSUMER FRAUD, HOME FINANCING, AND THE EROSION OF TRUST
T2  - NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
AB  - Consumer fraud is a civil violation of a remedial statute not requiring specific intent to deceive. Most consumer fraud statutes define violations as unconscionable, misleading, or deceptive practices irrespective of intent, in derogation of the principle of caveat emptor. They do not apply to business-to-business transactions. Trust plays a central role in businessto-consumer transactions. Because consumers are individuals, there is often an inherent inequality in consumer transactions. Sophisticated marketing techniques-especially target marketing that follows potential customers all over the internet-hound consumers ' online lives and manipulate purchasing decisions. The increasing monetization of almost everything exacerbates these effects. This transactionalism itself erodes trust because commercial trust is less robust than interpersonal trust. '' Consumers '' are not a monolithic category and the effects of consumer fraud depend on one ' s education, business sophistication, and ethnicity. The neoclassical model of a universal, rational, self-interested, decontextualized individual has numerous limitations, and we now know that rationality is bounded in any event-we are unable to incorporate all relevant information in our decision-making. Further, the neoclassical model does not accurately represent the financial situations and daily realities of most American consumers, who are working to middle class, struggling economically, and lacking in financial literacy. This Essay applies this framework to the phenomenon of home lending fraud, which was the primary cause of the Great Recession and the worldwide financial meltdown of 2008. Home lending fraud of all sorts erodes trust in our system and country. Trust tends to be eroded more in consumers who do not realize the risks taken when entering into these transactions, which is disproportionally the case with lower income consumers. They are hit especially hard because they have fewer resources, and if they own a home, it is generally their only valuable asset. In this Essay, I focus particularly on the example of land contracts-rent-to-own arrangements often accompanied by predatory features-that have looted many millions of dollars of wealth from low- to moderate-income Americans. The Essay finally turns to the post-Great Recession Dodd-Frank Act and its creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Bureau is the first federal agency with the sole mission to regulate consumer financial products. Dodd-Frank regulations and oversight have helped increase trust in consumer financial markets since the last financial crisis. Supervision of lending institutions-some of which were not previously subject to federal regulation-is a critical tool in resisting forces that continue to undermine trust in our system.

TI  - How the COVID-19 pandemic changed Italians' financial risk tolerance
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - PurposeThis research aims to investigate the impact of exogenous shocks on individuals' risk tolerance, particularly when originating outside the economic or financial sphere. Focusing on Italy as the first Western country affected by COVID-19, this paper explores whether the pandemic led to a decrease in Italians' financial risk tolerance (FRT).Design/methodology/approachThis study used a two-stage approach for data analysis. Initial examination of key variables used linear regression (ordinary least square [OLS]) with robust errors. Subsequently, a system of structural equations (structural equation model [SEM]) was used for a more nuanced exploration of hypothetical relationships between constructs and their observed indicators. SEM addressed reliability issues inherent in OLS, offering a robust analysis of structural models based on specified hypotheses. To assess the impact of COVID-19 on Italians' FRT, the Grable and Lytton Risk Tolerance Scale was used, measuring changes through a scored questionnaire with values ranging from 1 (greater risk aversion) to 4 (greater risk propensity).FindingsThis study used three distinct OLS regression models to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on Italians' FRT, considering mortality, infection and stringency rates. Findings revealed that older individuals exhibited lower risk tolerance across FRT dimensions, consistent with previous research. Men were more risk-prone, aligning with gender-related financial literacy disparities. Married respondents tended to be less risk-tolerant, supporting the idea that marital status influences risk attitude. Education level showed a slightly negative impact on investment risk. Professional instability, lower income and stock market inexperience were associated with lower risk tolerance. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant positive effect, making respondents more risk-averse. SEM methodology was used to examine the moderating effects of COVID-19 proxies on FRT changes.Originality/valueThis research brings a novel perspective to the ongoing debate on exogenous shocks' impact on individuals' risk tolerance, particularly when originating outside the economic or financial domain. Focusing on Italy, the first Western country hit by COVID-19, this study uniquely investigates the pandemic's effect on Italians' FRT. With a large and representative sample, the findings contribute significantly to the literature on risk attitude, shedding light on the pandemic's impact. This study's originality lies in providing reliable evidence with policy implications, emphasizing the imperative for government intervention in addressing both health and economic issues in the wake of such external shocks.

TI  - Antecedents of Murabaha home financing among Muslim household - an integrated framework
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - PurposeThough Murabaha financing experienced substantial growth in several majority-Muslim countries, its market share in the Moroccan banking industry is still very narrow than other conventional banks' instruments. The current research investigated the ability of an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework to explain the main drivers of attitude and intention to use Murabaha financing among Moroccan households. The moderating effect of Islamic religiosity was also scrutinized.Design/methodology/approachData were collected via a survey of 512 Moroccan consumers and analyzed using the partial least squares (PLS) technique.FindingsFirst, attitude toward Islamic banking products is a key predictor of consumer intention to use Murabaha financing. At the same time, consumers' attitudes are influenced by Islamic financial literacy, subjective norms, behavioral control and profit and loss sharing. Islamic religiosity was also found to positively moderate the link between attitudes towards Islamic banking (IB) and intention to use Murabaha financing, e.g. positive attitudes toward IB are more likely to convert into an intention to use Murabaha financing among Muslim consumers with higher levels of religiosity.Managerial implicationsTo boost consumers' intention to use Murabaha financing, Islamic bank managers should consider further investment in advertising to enhance consumers' awareness about IB products. Islamic banks should also consider digital and social media marketing to increase consumers' awareness about the products and spread a positive e-WOM with regards to their products. Our findings emphasize the importance of Islamic religiosity in shaping Muslim consumers' intentions to use Murabaha financing. Islamic banks ought to make sure that Murabaha financing contracts are strictly adherent to and compliant with Shari'ah principles. They should also train their frontline employees on Islamic financing activities so that they can effectively respond to the queries and questions of Murabaha potential consumers.Originality/valueThe study findings contribute to the IB literature by demystifying the key factors shaping Muslim consumers' intentions to use Murabaha financing. The study also extends the literature by emphasizing Islamic religiosity as a basis for Muslim consumers' behavior in the context of IB. To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to empirically investigate Muslim consumers' intention to use Murabaha financing in North Africa and the Arab countries.Peer reviewThe peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/IJSE-10-2022-0680

TI  - Financial Inclusion Gone Wrong: Securities and Cryptoassets Trading for Children
T2  - HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL
AB  - According to studies, money is a major source of anxiety for most Americans. In looking for ways to remedy the source of such anxiety, some believe that increasing children's financial orientation could help lower their money-related anxiety levels as adults. Identifying this market as a business opportunity-and reassured by research that shows that by age six, children are already veteran consumers of mobile apps-financial technology (fintech), decentralized finance (DeFi), and even traditional financial entities have started offering services and products to children. These services and products include a broad array of financial-related products and services, from enabling children to earn money for doing their chores, to trading stocks and cryptoassets, and even to earning digital assets and currencies while playing video games.The potential of this new market's clientele is valuable for two reasons. First, having more customers is always a good thing. Second, children will eventually mature into adult customers who presumably will continue using the services and products they like and are familiar with. And, although some legal challenges are associated with children-who are minors-entering financial-based online contracts, this business trend will continue to grow as it becomes socially acceptable to offer financial services to children. Society's newly adopted paradigms for describing, understanding, and shaping children's rights, domestic relationships, custodial status, and even digital purchasing power are all supportive of this trend. Moreover, fintech and DeFi apps and games can help teach children about the value of money, the importance of investing, and the risks involved in trading. Yet fintech and DeFi apps and games could also have a disruptive effect on children, both developmentally and behaviorally, similar to that of other consumed digital content. This disruptive effect should be a source of concern to anyone focused on investor and consumer protection, including regulatory agencies like the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which have already expressed concerns over gamification and digital engagement practices. In light of the financialization of everything, this Article looks to both legal and ethical reasoning and behavioral economics tools to call for the search for effective financial literacy education for children to be replaced by a search for policies more conducive to good consumer and investor protection outcomes. These policies should guide lawmakers in regulating fintech and DeFi apps and games offered to children in light of the following considerations: (i) the addictiveness of digital gaming; (ii) how gamifying finance makes it feel less serious; (iii) the connection between gamification and gambling; (iv) how children's financial choices are more susceptible to the influence of outside parties than are those of adults; (v) fintech and DeFi apps and games' failure to teach children the importance of concepts such as debt, credit, and financial commitments; and (vi) the unrealistic burden on young parents, who are already struggling to constantly supervise their children's online activities, to monitor their children's online financial activities in our digital era.

TI  - Lean-logistics in constructive geography: theoretical and methodological foundations
T2  - VISNYK OF V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATIONAL UNIVERSITY-SERIES GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY ECOLOGY
AB  - Research problem introduction. The main research goal of this paper is to provide the lean-logistics geosystem research concept as a contemporary approach of constructive geography closely connected with industry as a part of the service sector based on leading scientific principles, GIS-technologies and remote sensing data processing software involvement, and to give some details about this concept applied implementation. All these arguments allow us to specify and to study in-depth the peculiarities, key types, and specificities of the lean-logistics.
   In this paper, Lean-logistics is understood as an environmental service that helps to improve biodiversity and a stable environment. Lean-logistics itself can be developed as a type of modelling land use and land management activities. This activity can be even thought of as educational innovation with nature-based solutions.
   The key geographic-centered ideas of the concept of Lean-logistics are integration, engineering, economization, ecologization, socialization, and humanization of modern human activities.
   The methodological basis of Lean-logistics is presented by three sections, such as Section I. Theory of logistics (for instance, such aspects as general characteristics of logistics and its key features, Varieties of logistics and its classification, Lean logistics as a science: its place in logistics, key distinct features, etc.), Section II. Applied logistics (with such aspects as Military logistics, Business logistics, Environmental logistics, Urban logistics, and Logistics services), and Section III. Logistical construction (Lean-construction of commodity flows and Lean-construction in the field of services).
   The practical basis of Lean-logistics is formed by logic modelling (studios). Logic modelling in Lean-logistics are called logistics studios and are understood as a form of active practical activities of researchers. Summarizing and generalizing key ideas discussed in the text, the authors underline that the conceptual framework of the lean-logistics geosystem research is based on the implementation of four cross-cutting lines such as environmental security and sustainable development, health and safety, civic responsibility, business undertaking, and financial literacy. All of them aimed at forming a conscious citizen, all areas of activity of which are permeated by logistics chains.
   Concluding the research, the authors emphasize that the lean-logistics concept may be quite useful within the proposed content of Lean-logistics as a page navigator E-collection in the form of a book trailer. Some pages of it contain examples of the multimedia scrapbook of interactive exercises (deal with some definite sections and/or topics) which are presented using the Print Screen-visualization of the logistics lotto. The use of such tools, forms, technologies, techniques in the study of the content of "Lean-logistics in geography", as E-collection, book-trailer, hotlist, multimedia scrapbook, mind mapping software, QR-coding, Print Screen-visualization, with active use of GIS, educational Internet services, modernizes the learning process and with systematic use in practice makes them necessary and appropriate in the knowledge about geography and constructive geography.

TI  - Benchmarking-A Way of Finding Risk Factors in Business Performance
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The purpose of this study was to emphasize that the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method is an important benchmarking tool which provides necessary information for improving business performance. To fulfil the abovementioned goal, we used a sample of 48 Slovak companies involved in the field of heat supply. As their position in the economic and social environment of the country is essential, considerable attention should be paid to improving their performance. In addition to the DEA method, we applied the Best Value Method (BVM). We found that DEA is a highly important benchmarking tool, as it provides benchmarks for units that have problems with performance and helps us to reveal risk performance factors. The DEA method also allows us to determine target values of indicators. The originality of this paper is in its comparison of the results of the BVM and the DEA methods.

TI  - Economic impacts of Covid-19 on the labor market and human capital
T2  - TERRA ECONOMICUS
AB  - This paper tackles the economic impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the labor markets and human capital. Specifically, it looks into the issues the pandemic brought upon the human resources and personnel during coronavirus lockdowns. Our results identify that in spite of all the adverse effects of the pandemic such as the excessive burden on the healthcare system, great economic losses and disruptions on the labor market (such as the loss of human capital and widening gaps in gender inequality) due to the lockdowns in many countries intended to slow down the spread of the infection with the purpose of flattening the curve representing the numbers of the COVID-19 patients, the current situation had many positive economic effects. For instance, we find that the recent pandemic helped to increase the financial inclusion and enabled broader access to financial system. In addition, during the past few months, digitalization and the use of information technology deepened and progressed in both large and small enterprises as well as in the higher education institutions. Moreover, COVID-19 pandemic helped to develop the awareness about the climate change among many people by demonstrating how the decrease in economic activity can have a profound effect on cutting CO2 emissions. Furthermore, we find that COVID-19 pandemic contributed to optimizing work load and cutting unnecessary work in many large and small business companies and public institutions. It is likely that most of them will continue with this optimization and digitalization of work after the pandemic is over. Last but not least, we note the enhanced family life and interpersonal relations that would without any doubt contribute to the quality of human capital and the level of happiness. Our results might be useful for public officials and labor market specialists who would want to grasp the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and to find ways how to smoothen its impacts.

TI  - Factors Associated With Electronic Banking Adoption
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - Using data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, this study investigates factors that affect electronic banking adoption rates. Financial knowledge, income, education, and credit card ownership are associated with a high probability of electronic banking adoption. However, age is negatively associated with the probability of online banking adoption and the African American consumer is less likely to adopt electronic banking. This result is more prominent for African American women but does not hold for African American business owners. Financial counselors, planners, and educators should be aware and sensitive to these differences in order to provide additional education as needed on how to effectively use electronic banking services in order to achieve a greater degree of financial inclusion.

TI  - Investment Motivations and UK Business Angels' Appetite for Risk Taking: The Moderating Role of Experience
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - In this paper we use a large UK survey of business angels (BAs) investing in two different publicly supported schemes to directly question the role that investment motivations play in shaping investors' appetite for risk. We dive deeper into the relationship between investment reasons and risk taking, by exploring the potential for a moderating effect derived from BAs' past experience (i.e. financial and entrepreneurial experience). Our analysis reveals that both investment reasons (for return and for passion) have substantial explanatory power in shaping angels' risk attitude, but their effect is moderated by the investors' prior experience. This key finding represents important empirical support for what has so far been anecdotal evidence concerning BAs' appetite for risk when investing.

TI  - How do retail investors react to a market crash? The role of investment literacy
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - This study investigates retail investors' behaviour when the US stock market dropped precipitously by 10% in early February 2018. Results show that investors with higher investment literacy were more likely to buy additional stocks and less likely to sell their stocks, which indicates that they expected a quick recovery of the market. We also find that older investors and investors with greater risk aversion were more likely to hold their positions without buying or selling stocks. Similar evidence is found in reactions to a 20% hypothetical market drop. This study sheds light on the meagre literature on retail investors' behaviour during market crash.

TI  - TRANSVERSAL COMPETENCIES OF INNOVATIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROFESSIONALS IN LIFELONG EDUCATION
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - For the effective development of Ukraine in the conditions of global changes (political, economic, social, educational) the priority should be transition to a new economy - knowledge economy. The basis of knowledge economy will be the professional development of specialists in innovative business structures through lifelong learning, in particular formation of their transversal competencies. These qualitatively new specialists will be able to ensure the transition of companies to innovative forms of organization of production activities. The purpose of the article is to reveal the importance of transversal competencies formation among specialists of innovative business structures in lifelong learning to ensure competitiveness of Ukrainian companies at the international level. Methodology. To achieve the goal, general scientific and special research methods were used: comparative analysis and generalization - to study the international experience of innovative business structures; synthesis of theoretical and empirical data - to characterize Ukrainian companies according to the innovation index; structural-functional and system analysis - to study the features of knowledge economy and form hard, soft and business skills. Results. In formation of business structures, Ukraine still uses traditional criteria, while in the world there are innovative approaches - companies "gazelles", clusters, etc. Characteristic features and problems of gazelle companies functioning are analyzed, in particular concerning the personnel component. It is proposed to consider successful enterprises as centers of new economic zones, around which related enterprises, promotion infrastructure, clusters should be purposefully built. It is determined that national economic competitiveness is associated with knowledge and innovation driven capital. Two approaches to the management of business structures are analyzed. The first is based on implementation of subject-subject relationships, development of innovative transversal competencies in order to expand managers' "breadth of management skills" through La-education. The second is the experience of innovative enterprises, where management is transformed into information management with its inherent impersonal post / non / management. Formation of the phenomenon of transversal competencies on the basis of La-education is analyzed. This is ensured by changes in hard skills, acquisition of new soft skills and integrated business skills, which contributes to the creation of a new generation of professionals. It is determined that business skills are integrated from soft skills, which accumulate intellectual property knowledge, investment and financial literacy, sales skills, presentations and business negotiations, event management, project management, people, their work and time, etc. Emphasis is placed on the importance of forming knowledge economy based on the intellectual potential of society, in which the main levers are the processes of accumulation and use of information and its transformation into knowledge, which depends on the economic progress of the country. It is determined that on the basis of formation of scientific and educational clusters, introduction of crowd technologies, crowdsourcing in education during life the professional development of experts of innovative business structures will be provided. Practical importance.
   The results of the research can be used in the creation of training programs, retraining, reskilling and changing types of work in the modern production space, which include provisions of knowledge economy for professional development of innovative business structures through lifelong learning. The basic postulates of research can be useful for managers whose companies implement innovative approaches to management, the latest technologies in production activities and promote mobility in retraining in accordance with sociel needs. Correlation/originality. Conclusions reached will help economists, politologists, social scientists and LLL learning educators to understand the importance of innovative concepts in development business structures and formation transverse competencies based on hard, soft and business skills.

TI  - Threshold Effect of Financial Inclusion on Poverty Reduction in Africa: Does institutional quality play a role?
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS
AB  - In Africa, poverty levels are still very high, especially with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite efforts by governments and development partners to address it. Financial inclusion has been identified as an important concept in fighting poverty due to its ability to increase the income level of households. This study sought to estimate the threshold level at which financial inclusion, aided by strong institutions, will lead to poverty reduction in Africa, using Hansen's threshold estimation method, covering a period of 2004-2020. The Hansen threshold estimation method uses an endogenous approach to identify threshold values, which eliminates deterministic process by using a systematic approach, as compared to the linear methods of sample-splitting of threshold-level specifications by other methods. This therefore makes the Hansen threshold estimation method robust in threshold estimations compared to other methods. The study found double threshold values of 0.0534 and 0.341, indicating that a financial inclusion value below 0.0534 would increase household consumption expenditure, leading to poverty reduction. However, a threshold value between 0.0534 and 0.3141 has a negative impact on poverty reduction. Furthermore, beyond a threshold value of 0.3141, financial inclusion will improve household consumption and as such reduce poverty in Africa. The study also established a threshold value of institutional quality index of -1.6325, indicating that below that institutional quality index, financial inclusion will have a negative impact on household consumption as well as poverty reduction in Africa. The results further indicated that dependency ratio, gross national income, interest rate, inflation, education, and government expenditure contribute significantly to poverty reduction in Africa. It is recommended that development partners, central banks and governments in the region should consciously develop and implement financial literacy policies, with the collaboration of all financial institutions that are aimed at promoting financial inclusion due to its ability to end poverty.
   Financial inclusion has been accepted globally to be the means to end global poverty due to its ability to ensure growth in the income of households. Africa is one of the poorest continents in the world, indicating, among others, that there is a low financial inclusion level in the continent. The relationship between financial inclusion and poverty reduction has been inconclusively established in the literature. Most importantly, the establishment of the nonlinear relationship between the financial inclusion and poverty reduction and estimation of the exact level of financial inclusion that will trigger poverty reduction are all missing in the literature. There is also the need to interrogate the level at which financial barriers will hurt the poverty reduction efforts. To handle these concerns, this study estimates the threshold level at which financial inclusion will lead to poverty reduction as well as the threshold level at financial barriers will prevent one from participating in the financial sector. In all of these, the moderating role institutional quality plays in the financial inclusion and poverty reduction drive was also investigated. It was established in the study that there exists a double threshold level at which financial inclusion, moderated by strong institutions, will stimulate poverty reduction in Africa as well as a single threshold level at which financial barriers will hinder one from participating in the financial sector and the poverty reduction efforts. In view of the findings, the study stated some policy recommendations aimed at improving financial inclusion to stimulate poverty reduction in Africa.

TI  - A BP Neural Network-Based Method for Evaluating the Quality of Creative Education in Minority Regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS
AB  - Ethnic minority resources are very rich and contain rich historical resources and culture. Under the impact of modern information technology, the development of minority resources and the inheritance of ethnic culture are facing many challenges, and the current school education is lagging behind in exploring the ecological resources of minority groups, which makes the integration of creative education and minority groups encounter a bottleneck. In response to this situation, we make full use of the platform of creative education to actively explore the traditional skills contained in the lives of ethnic minorities. In the evaluation of creative education, we should not only focus on the evaluation of students' works, but also on the improvement of students' knowledge of various creative tools, their ability to use comprehensive subject knowledge, hands-on ability, solution ability and creativity ability during the whole learning process. Based on this, this paper proposes a back propagation neural network (BPNN)-based quality evaluation method for creative education to evaluate the quality of creative education from multiple dimensions. Experiments and comparisons show that the BPNN-based evaluation method proposed in this paper can better evaluate the whole process of creative education and help the further development of creative education in minority regions.

TI  - COVID-19 pandemic and linkage between stock markets in Middle Eastern countries
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHINESE ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN TRADE STUDIES
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the linkage between stock markets in Middle Eastern countries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic by using daily and monthly data sets for the period from 2011 to 2021.Design/methodology/approachThe multivariate BEKK-GARCH model was computed to evaluate the existence of non-linear linkage among Middle Eastern stock markets. A correlation approach was used in this study to determine the type of linear connectivity between Middle Eastern stock markets. The study used monthly and daily data sets covering the years 2011 to 2021 to investigate the linkage between stock returns and the volatility spillover between the stock markets in Palestine, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, both before and during COVID-19. To understand the types of relationships between markets before and during COVID-19, the daily data set was split into two periods.FindingsResults from the pre-COVID-19 suggest that the Syria stock market is not related to any stock market in the Middle East markets; the Palestine and Lebanon stock markets exhibit a weak relationship, but Jordan and Palestine stock markets are strongly linked. Conversely, results from COVID-19 evince a very strong bidirectional volatility spillover between Middle East stock markets. Overall, the results indicate the existence of increased linkage during the COVID-19.Research limitations/implicationsThe data collection on a daily and monthly basis, both before and during COVID-19, presents certain limitations for the paper. Another limitation is that the data cannot be generalized to all other Middle Eastern countries; rather, the conclusions drawn can only be applied to these four countries. This is especially true if the scholars collected most of the necessary data but were unable to obtain certain data for various reasons.Practical implicationsThese findings have implications for risk management, market regulation and the growth of local stock markets. Facilitating the growth of smaller, more specialized markets to improve integration with other Middle Eastern markets is one of the goals of the domestic stock market development policy. To ensure financial stability, Middle Eastern stock market linking policies should consider spillover risk and take steps to minimize it. Enhancing the range of investment opportunities accessible to shareholders and functioning as confidential risk-sharing mechanisms to facilitate improved risk management in Middle Eastern stock markets will not only significantly influence the mobilization of private capital to promote investment and local economic growth but also lay groundwork for integrated market platforms.Originality/valueThis paper adds to the body of literature by demonstrating the nature of the connections between these small markets and the larger markets in the Middle East region. Information from the smaller markets provides institutional insights that enhance the body of existing research, guide the formulation of evidence-based policies and advance financial literacy in these markets. This study contributes by comparing data from different stock markets to better understand the type and strength of the link and relationship between Middle Eastern stock markets, as well as any underlying or reinforcing factors that might have contributed to the relationship and the specific types of links that these markets shared prior and during COVID-19.

TI  - Who understands the US housing market?
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - We perform econometrics analyses on a database retrieved from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, named the "Survey of Consumers' Expectations" (SCE), for the period 2013-19, by which 12,857 respondents gave their impressions of the US real estate market. We add to the common list of drivers of market predictions an analysis of the extent to which the respondents misjudged the housing market for the following year. We include state-level macro-economic data, such as state income and growth, to reinforce the understanding of this phenomenon. Heterogeneous profiles emerge based on market information available to consumers.

TI  - Can entrepreneurship bring happiness? Evidence from China
T2  - ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between entrepreneurial activities and the happiness of entrepreneurs. We estimate the effects of entrepreneurial decision-making, business experience and other factors on happiness by using China Household Finance Survey data. Our results derived from maximum likelihood estimation methods indicate that entrepreneurial decision-making and entrepreneurial experience affect household happiness significantly. The family well-being is significantly increased if the family is entrepreneurial, and it will be higher if actively entrepreneurial. Both entrepreneurial experience and entrepreneurial investment of time have significantly positive effect on the probability of family well-being. In addition, we find that the mechanism by which entrepreneurship brings happiness to households is through raising household income and wealth, that is, income effects and wealth effects.

TI  - Relying on the heuristic of trust: a case study
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - This study examines the reliance on trust as a heuristic by individuals when making personal financial decisions, using a qualitative case study. We show that in the face of complexity and choice, individual investors predominantly resorted to the heuristic of trust to make financial decisions. This demonstrates the need for industry and public policy-makers to be aware that individuals can and will resort to simplified heuristics as a basis for financial decision-making, particularly within an environment where substantial complexity and choice exist.

TI  - Comprehending the Crypto-Curious: How Investors and Inexperienced Potential Investors Perceive and Practice Cryptocurrency Trading
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
AB  - With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency, many people are interested in cryptocurrency investments, but have so far hesitated. Many others have made investments without adequate preparation. To help interested investors improve their understanding of cryptocurrency and make rational investment decisions, it is important to study their concerns and motivations and to draw upon experienced investors' experiences and practices. Therefore, we surveyed crypto investors and inexperienced potential investors interested in trading cryptocurrency (n = 395). Our results showed that extreme price volatility is the primary incentive and a substantial obstacle to market participation. Fraud risks, lack of personal funds, insufficient knowledge, and difficulty identifying credible information sources are also common barriers. Our findings highlight the need to build trustworthy exchange platforms and integrate educational features. Based on the reported concerns and experiences, we (1) identify learning components for new investors, and (2) formulate design recommendations for beginner-friendly exchange platforms.

TI  - Impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThe study focused on the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs at the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia, from 2019 to 2023.Design/methodology/approachThe design of the paper is empirical-analytical, focusing on the tangible and unique aspects of reality that can be fragmented for measurement. This approach privileges the use of data from the study population's experience, which is treated analytically through statistics to establish frequencies and correlations between variables. The research involved a structured questionnaire based on bibliographic references and considering the operational framework of the variables, which underwent expert review, necessary adjustments, a pilot test and subsequent validation in 2019 and 2023. The reliability of the instrument was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, ensuring a reliable indicator when equal to or greater than 0.7 in each analysis period. This methodology aimed to identify practices and how the financial profile influences short term.FindingsThe findings from the survey conducted with the microentrepreneurs at Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center reveal several significant connections to the theoretical framework. The study revealed that many microentrepreneurs relied on their personal funds for business financing, indicating a limited understanding of financial principles. Additionally, a significant portion of microentrepreneurs mitigated investment risk by securing loans from financial institutions, yet none utilized government subsidies like entrepreneurship loans, pointing to a lack of advice. The findings underscore the importance of financial education and suitable financial services for business development.Research limitations/implicationsOne limitation of this study is the lack of detailed data on the financial structure of microentrepreneurs' businesses, as well as specific information on interest rates and the terms and conditions of the microcredit used. These limitations may affect the generalization of the results and the comprehensive understanding of the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs. Future research could include a larger sample size and more accurate data on the financial structure of businesses, as well as a detailed investigation of interest rates and terms and conditions of microcredit, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the financial impacts for microentrepreneurs.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study have practical implications for microentrepreneurs in the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center. The research emphasizes the need for improved financial knowledge, accounting practices and debt management among microentrepreneurs. It also highlights the importance of financial education and access to suitable financial services for business development. The study's insights can guide the development of training programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing financial literacy and financial management among microentrepreneurs, leading to more informed decision-making and improved financial outcomes.Social implicationsFrom a social perspective, this research contributes to promoting economic development and financial inclusion. By addressing the mismanagement of microcredit by microentrepreneurs and providing insights into their short-term finances, the study aims to foster economic empowerment and sustainable development within communities.
   The findings underscore the significance of microfinance in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. The research emphasizes the importance of equitable access to financial services, which can contribute to narrowing the gap between the financially excluded population and the conventional financial system.Originality/valueThis research adds originality and value to the academic community by addressing the incidence of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs in the specific context of the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia. By characterizing the financial profile of microentrepreneurs, establishing the relationship between microcredit characteristics and the financial profile and proposing an action plan, the study provides valuable insights for decision-making in both the academic and microfinance fields. The research contributes to the existing literature on microfinance and financial inclusion, offering a unique perspective and potential solutions for optimizing the use of microcredit-funded resources by microentrepreneurs.

TI  - The COVID-19 Crises: The Threats, Uncertainties and Risks in Entrepreneurial Development
T2  - RISKS
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and its different waves brought several complications to people's social lives and massively affected business activities worldwide. Accordingly, in this study, we explored the various COVID-19 threats, uncertainties, and risks that are faced by entrepreneurship, propensity, and development. We applied a deductive approach in this study and utilized cross-sectional data that we collected through a questionnaire. We based this study's findings on 320 valid cases. By employing structural equation modeling (SEM), we reveal that factors, such as quality of business environment (QoBE) and access to financial resources (AtFR,) have a positive and significant impact on entrepreneurial propensity (EP). On the other hand, the findings reveal that two factors, namely the uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (UoCOVID-19) and the risk perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic (RPoCOVID-19), have a negative effect on EP. This study's findings provide valuable information about the COVID-19 pandemic and, on particular, on the development of EP among university students. In addition, this study's findings guide and support policymakers and higher authorities in understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other business-related factors for developing EP. Further, these findings support the creation of conducive business environments even during a global pandemic or another natural disaster. Finally, this study's findings contribute other empirical evidence to enrich previous research on health, business, and management.

TI  - Investigating the financial overconfidence of student-athletes
T2  - SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose There is a paucity of empirical research that explores the financial well-being of collegiate student-athletes. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the key aspects of financial well-being (e.g. financial knowledge, financial self-efficacy and finance-related stress levels) of varsity athletes at US colleges and universities. Design/methodology/approach The authors used data from the National Student Financial Wellness Study. The data were analyzed using general linear regression models. Findings The findings suggest student-athletes have lower financial knowledge than students who are non-athletes. Despite their lower levels of financial knowledge, these student-athletes report higher levels of financial self-efficacy. Furthermore, even when controlling for scholarship funding, student-athletes reported lower levels of financial stress than their counterparts. One could interpret this as student-athletes having a false sense of confidence in their money management behaviors. This overconfidence can impact many areas of their overall financial well-being. Alternatively, non-athletes may not be as financially confident as they should be. Research limitations/implications This study could be replicated with stronger measures (e.g. Financial Self-Efficacy Scale), with the inclusion of subjective financial knowledge measures, comparing the impact of demographic variables. As, most financial constructs have gender differences (Farrellet al., 2016) and race differences (Amatucci and Crawley, 2011) and depend upon college major (Fosnacht and Calderone, 2017). Another limitation of this study is the small percentage of student-athletes, a common problem with research in this area. Further research is also needed to unpack the finding that self-efficacy decreases at higher levels of financial knowledge. Practical implications It is evident that college students (athletes/non-athletes) need financial education. For universities and college coaches, this study could be used as a rationale for providing financial education for their athletes. The addition of financial courses could be used as a recruiting tool for collegiate coaches and benefit the university. Requiring financial education could also benefit universities long term as it may potentially increase the donor possibilities by alumni. As a final note, it is important that financial courses figure out ways to improve financial self-efficacy alongside financial knowledge, as findings suggest both are integral to decreasing financial stress. Social implications Less than 4 percent of universities in the USA require students to take a personal finance course (Bledsoeet al., 2016). If more universities included personal finance as a graduation requirement and did more to engage student-athletes (and non-athletes) in financial planning, then the average level of financial knowledge would likely improve on campuses across the USA. In addition, increasing young adults financial self-efficacy could improve financial stress which is linked to mental health and physical health. Originality/value This study provides the first empirical look into the financial well-being of collegiate student-athletes across the USA. Although there are many benefits to participation in college sports, student-athletes face additional time pressures and a predisposition to clustering around certain majors. Findings suggest that collegiate athletes need additional support around their financial literacy and non-athletes may need support developing financial self-efficacy.
   These two findings should be used by academic institutions and athletic departments to determine how to encourage financial health in their student-athletes and general student body.

TI  - Navigating uncertainties: a tri-factorial evaluation of risk management adoption in MSMEs
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - The study explores the implementation of risk management in Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia, with the objective of enhancing their adoption and fostering sustainable business practices. Despite the overarching goal, many MSMEs in Indonesia still lag in the implementation of risk management. The research specifically targets MSMEs without existing internal control and risk management systems. The questionnaire was distributed to 200 MSME representatives through an online Google Form. Out of these, we received 140 completed responses. After a thorough review for completeness and relevance to the study criteria, 111 responses were deemed suitable for analysis, resulting in a response rate of 70%. After the data is obtained, it is analyzed using partial least squares using smart-pls 4.0. Relative advantage (RA) is the most influential indicator on Adoption of Risk Identification (ARI). Other important factors are complexity (COMX), and security (SECU) for MSMEs. Conversely, organizational readiness (OR) and competitive pressure (CP) were found not to have a significant impact on ARI, suggesting these are not primary factors in enhancing risk identification adoption and business sustainability. These findings provide insightful implications for the strategic prioritization of risk management components in the Indonesian MSME sector.

TI  - The Effect of Investment Literacy on the Likelihood of Retail Investor Margin Trading and Having a Margin Call
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Using a sample of 1,215 US retail investors, we provide evidence on the effect of investment literacy and of investment literacy overconfidence on the likelihood of purchasing securities on margin, and also, among those who had purchased securities on margin, the likelihood of experiencing a margin call. Based on multivariate analyses, the likelihood of buying on margin decreased with investment literacy, and also increased with overconfidence. The likelihood of buying on margin decreased with age, and increased with risk tolerance and with the amount of investment assets. Among those who had bought securities on margin, the likelihood of experiencing a margin call decreased with investment literacy, without control variables, and increased with risk tolerance. However, with control variables, no variable had a significant relationship with having a margin call. This study provides important insights for researchers as well as practitioners on the relationship between margin trading and market quality.

TI  - Is conflicted investment advice better than no advice?
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The benefit of investment advice depends on the quality of advice and the investor's counterfactual portfolio. We use changes in the Oregon University System Optional Retirement Plan to highlight the impact of plan design on the counterfactual portfolios of advice seekers. When brokers are available and target date funds (TDFs) are not, brokers help participants with high predicted demand for advice bear market risk, but they recommend higher-commission options. When brokers are removed and TDFs are added, new highpredicted-demand participants primarily invest in TDFs, which offer similar market risk but higher Sharpe ratios than the broker-advised portfolios within our sample.

TI  - The distribution of savings behaviours and macro dynamics
T2  - OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES
AB  - This article formulates a Keynesian macro model and explores its underlying dynamics. The distinctive features of the model relative to other Keynesian frameworks are: (1) the assumption that households are spread over a behavioural distribution that reflects their idiosyncratic attitudes towards savings; (2) the consideration of a macro-micro feedback mechanism according to which the state of the economy (measured by aggregate output or the unemployment rate) influences households' savings behaviours. The devised analytical setup generates intuitive and appealing dynamic results, namely the formation of two alternative stable steady states, which are representative of two possible macroeconomic outcomes (with and without full employment). The stability of the steady state might be broken when the reaction of savings behaviours to perturbations in the unemployment rate is strong. The framework is flexible enough to allow for a compelling analysis of the implications of fiscal and monetary policies.

TI  - When the Lender Extends a Helping Hand: Native CDFI Client Counseling and Loan Performance in Indian Country
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS RACE AND POLICY
AB  - Native Community Development Financial Institutions (NCDFIs) fill credit supply gaps and promote financial inclusion in Native communities. To mitigate lending risks and aid clients, NCDFIs often rely on unconventional lending practices such as providing clients with free financial counseling. Drawing on uniquely detailed consumer loan-level data of one prominent NCDFI, we empirically model the hazard of a loan turning into bad debt. Our analysis shows that borrower exposure to NCDFI-provided financial counseling appreciably reduces the prospects of consumer loan failure when the borrower has had limited prior credit-market experience. Personalized coaching is more effective than the relatively less client-tailored, classroom-style training. Our results have implications for the lending practices of creditors serving Native communities and beyond. More broadly, our findings are indicative of the importance of the growing, but understudied, NCDFI industry for financial development of Indian Country.

TI  - Between Income, Savings and Investment, How Do College Students Perceive Money Management?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The aim of the study is to evaluate the factorial solution that explains financial knowledge in the topics of income, savings, investment and how students perceive money management. For this purpose, the EFA and the SEM methodology are used. To obtain the information, a non-probabilistic sampling by self-determination was carried out, applying the instrument in electronic format and for the analysis; the EFA and SEM methodology was used. At the end of the estimated time for data collection, 596 participating students were achieved. The items of the variables income, savings, investment and money management from the scale used in Contreras (2016), were used. The main finding is the structure obtained from the confirmatory analysis, which presents acceptable indices of absolute goodness of fit, structural adjustment, and parsimony that allows us to understand how the student perceives income, savings, investment, and money management. The values obtained are acceptable based on the suggested theoretical criteria (RMSEA = 0,054; CMIN/DF = 2,749; GFI (,951), AGFI = ,926; PGFI = ,634; TLI = ,906; CFI = ,929; and parsimony: PRATIO = ,762; PNFI = ,681; PCFI = ,707). The result has practical implications for educational institutions, considering that in the academic training of students it is essential to encourage habits related to money. Considering that, economic income is a resource that they will have in their future when they work, then it is related to the habit of saving and investing, to this, we add the good and proper management of their personal finances, and finally, the cycle of promotion to savings.

TI  - Wealth and Welfare: Do Private and Public Safety Nets Compensate for Asset Poverty?
T2  - SOCIAL INCLUSION
AB  - Economic shocks test the resilience of families around the world. Lockdowns, extended periods of unemployment, and inflation challenge the capabilities of private households to maintain their living standards whilst keeping their budgets in balance. Asset poverty is a concept invoked frequently to measure the capacity of private households to mitigate income loss by relying exclusively on their savings. In contrast to conventional asset poverty measures, we quantify the com-bined cushioning effect of private and public safety nets. Highlighting the importance of public safety nets and familial networks, this article devises a modified concept of asset poverty: Rather than purely simulating a household's asset decumulation without replacement income, the modified indicator accounts for replacement income in a static setting. The empirical assessment of modified asset poverty in Europe and America combines harmonised microdata on house-hold finances with simulations of institutional rules set by social insurance systems. Our results reveal how differences in social relations and institutional rules shape cross-country variation in the vulnerability of private households. We find that, in contrast to the US, where the asset poverty of families is particularly low, households in most European coun-tries are less vulnerable because generous social security systems coexist with low private assets. However, in some European countries, benefit generosity decreases the longer income losses last, exposing time dynamics in vulnerability. Complementing social insurance mechanisms, in countries such as Greece, households are more likely to receive finan-cial support from family or friends. Cross-national heterogeneity in vulnerability suggests that a shock may have different implications across countries.

TI  - Investor Confidence and Reaction to a Stock Market Crash
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - This paper explores how investor overconfidence impacts reactions to stock market crashes. Using the 2018 Investor Survey dataset from FINRA we measure respondent's self-perceived and actual investment knowledge and thus are able to identify overconfident investors from other investors. In our analysis, we find overconfident investors were significantly more likely to sell after a stock market crash than other investors, and thus more likely to lock-in the losses from the crash and miss subsequent upswings in the market. Moreover, these overconfident investors were significantly more likely than other investors to pursue risky investment strategies such as cryptocurrencies, margin accounts, options, and penny stocks that can also lead to large losses. Finally, we find that accurately aware investors, investors who have both high perceived and actual knowledge, buy significantly more after a crash.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF SELF-CONTROL UPON PARTICIPATION IN VOLUNTARY PENSION SCHEMES
T2  - ECONOMICS & SOCIOLOGY
AB  - Population ageing, together with the recent economic downturn and its aftermath, are giving considerable cause for concern as regards the future sustainability of public pension systems. Voluntary pension schemes emerge here as an alternative to supplement the public pension pillar, and therefore, understanding how individuals make their financial decisions when participating in voluntary pension schemes becomes a question of key importance. There is a growing literature aimed at analysing this issue, but few studies to date have analysed the effect of behavioural traits on participation in voluntary pension schemes. Particularly, an analysis of the effect of self-control on this financial decision will be the aim of this paper. Based on data from the International Survey ofAdult Financial Literag, this paper analyses, through probit regression models, the effect of financial self-control, besides other control variables, e.g., gender, on the holding of financial assets for retirement savings. Empirical evidence reveals that higher levels of financial self-control are positively associated with saving for retirement. Moreover, when this variable is considered, the statistically significant effect of other driving forces traditionally highlighted by previous literature disappears. Therefore, our empirical evidence supports the need to consider behavioural issues in explaining individuals' financial decisions.

TI  - Determinants of seeking advice within defined contribution retirement savings schemes
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - We report results from a study of superannuation member advice-seeking within their plan, explaining observed patterns by member age, gender, issue salience and size-of-bet effect. Inquiry mode, frequency and volume of contact with the advice-provider, and sensitivity of members to legislative change and macroeconomic events are considered. Results show that gender (female more likely than male), age (older rather than younger), balance (larger rather than smaller) and experience (longer rather than shorter) are the strongest advice-seeking predictors, consistent over time. Findings suggest member engagement around retirement planning may be more effective when considering the factors affecting advice-seeking behaviour in general.

TI  - Counteroffers and Price Discrimination in Mortgage Lending
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE
AB  - This study analyzes price discrimination and household switching in the residential mortgage market. Using a unique proprietary micro dataset from Norway, we examine the factors that influence a bank's choice to counter an offer from a competing bank and the difference between the loan rate paid by current clients when receiving a competing offer from another bank and the concurrent best rate offered to new customers by the current bank. The estimates show that a bank employs internal information to decide how to counter a competing offer and that current clients pay approximately 20 basis points more than new customers. We surmise that new regulations and digitalization enhance transparency and can reduce the rate differential. However, introducing new banking products and changes in the timing of rate differentiation-from immediate upfront to gradually over time-may be used to maintain a constant rate differential.

TI  - The Effect of Expected Income on Wealth Accumulation and Retirement Contribution of Thai Wageworkers
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - Thailand has now become the aging society. However, the fact that the majority of Thai wageworkers do not effectively save for their retirement may result in several elderly living below the poverty threshold during retirement. The objectives of this research article were to find the factors determining Thai wageworkers' retirement contribution. Founded on the theory of life-cycle hypothesis, this article employed a sample of 300 wageworkers in the Northeast of Thailand and performed a statistical analysis using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach using age as a moderator. The empirical results revealed that expected income, wealth accumulation, career status, and health status were the main constructs influencing an individual's ability to contribute to his or her retirement. This article suggested that a wageworker should first contribute his or her income through wealth accumulation schemes such as investment in financial assets, for example, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and properties, investment in other business as a second job, and simply cash deposit. The results suggested that wealth accumulation was the most important mediator allowing a wageworker to contribute to retirement effectively in the long term. This article also proposed thoughtful research implications for wageworkers, employers, and the Thai government. This article recommended that the government and authorized bodies (e.g., the Bank of Thailand and the Stock Exchange of Thailand) should provide more investment alternatives and improve investment knowledge of the citizens. This would allow the citizens to have sufficient financial knowledge to invest in riskier financial instruments that potentially give better returns such as stocks.

TI  - Insurance literacy among older people in Japan: The role of socio-economic status
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Insurance literacy has received little attention in academic research despite its role in risk management, particularly among older people, a population most in need of a secure income and coverage for health care expenses after retirement. Using data from the Survey on the Economic Status of the Japanese Elderly conducted by Hiroshima University, we examined how the socio-economic status of older people in Japan was related to the attainment of insurance literacy. We found that the overall level of insurance literacy was quite low among older people in Japan, particularly among the oldest subgroup and women. Our regression results show that older people who are men, married, relatively younger, moderately educated, have a higher balance of financial assets, and those who have work experience in management, business, or finance are more likely to be insurance literate. Our results indicate that social learning plays an important role in insurance literacy.

TI  - How Does Mortgage Debt Affect Household Consumption? Micro Evidence from China
T2  - REAL ESTATE ECONOMICS
AB  - The high growth rate of mortgage debt in various emerging and developed economies has captured headlines following the financial crisis. In this article, we investigate how mortgage debt impacts household consumption behavior and various components of household consumption. Utilizing comprehensive household survey data from China, we show that households with a mortgage consume a higher portion of income than households without a mortgage. This is in line with the argument that having a mortgage reduces the uncertainty that the household faces regarding how much to save each month in order to be able to own a house, and this reduced uncertainty leads to lower monthly savings for the purpose of buying a house. We also find that among households with a mortgage, those who spend a larger share of their income on mortgage payments spend less on consumption, reflecting the crowding out effect of mortgage payments on household consumption. Furthermore, we show that a government policy of decreasing the maximum loan-to-value ratio has a significant impact on households' consumption. The article offers the first evidence of the impact of growing mortgage debt on the consumption behavior of households, and will have implications for government policies that encourage mortgage borrowing.

TI  - To buy or not to buy: household risk hedging of housing costs
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - This study studies Chinese households' decision between buying or renting a primary residence from a risk hedging perspective. Although homeownership means bearing house price risk, it eliminates exposure to rent risk. Our empirical results suggest that the homeownership rate increases with the rent volatility of living areas and decreases with the probability of move. However, households no longer hedge against the rent risk when owning a second house, which is often purchased as an investment property. Furthermore, we investigate households with heads aged over 60. Due to finite life expectancy, the rent hedging benefit of owning is weakened.

TI  - Overconfidence and investment: An experimental approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE
AB  - A positive relation between overconfidence and investment provision has been theoretically justified and practically assumed in the literature, but has not been thoroughly investigated. We test and confirm this positive relation between direct measures of overconfidence in one's financial knowledge and choice of investment. More precisely, strong overconfidence results in excess investment, underconfidence induces underinvestment, whereas moderate overconfidence leads to accurate investments. Our experimental results are based on different subject pools, financial professionals and students, and different media: computer-, paper-, and web-based. The degree of one's overestimation of one's individual financial knowledge relative to one's actual knowledge as well as relative to the knowledge of peers explains investment decisions better than one's actual knowledge. The relation between overconfidence and investment is robust to the degree of individual risk aversion, the riskiness of the investment projects, and to the changes in incentives structure.

TI  - An analytical study of HDI among India and its adjoining nations with reference to the relationship of literacy rate
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Economic growth is consistently a concern for any country. GDP growth and per capita income is a vital indicator on economic growth. These pointers portray the increase or decrease in productivity and income of the economy. Humans are an important part of productivity, but human welfare, equity, and social justice are not recorded. Economic advancement cannot be measured through GDP contribution, as it overlooks the disparity of income, poverty, unemployment, and other issues in the economy. The concept of the human development index proposed by Mahbub-ul-Haq and later refined by UNDP provides the correct parameter for evaluating economic development. This paper endeavours to comprehend the pattern of HDI among Indian and its adjoining nations and to check the contribution of each parameter in calculating the HDI of any country. The impact of the literacy rate on the HDI rate is also studied in the paper.

TI  - Behavioral Savings: Heterogeneous Household Beliefs and Aggregate Nonlinearities Orlando
T2  - NONLINEAR DYNAMICS PSYCHOLOGY AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB  - Well documented empirical evidence points to the existence of strong heterogeneity regarding households' savings behavior over the life cycle: individuals endowed with identical inherited wealth, and with similar prospective income earnings and life expectancy, often select antithetical strategies when formulating their consumption-savings intertemporal plans. Underlying this evidence resides the fact that psychology matters, i.e., that economic agents are frequently influenced by their intrinsic beliefs (commanded by genetics and education) and by social and cultural motivations, thus deviating from strict rationality and strict optimal behavior. In this paper, a model of behavioral savings is proposed. In the model, three psychological profiles potentially coexist: individuals can be aligned with the rationality benchmark or, alternatively, they may depart from it by holding optimistic or pessimistic beliefs about future earnings. Each generation of households assumes one of the profiles (rational optimistic - pessimistic), and new generations form their beliefs by making a constrained assessment of the utility levels attained by the existing generations (namely, they will mimic the behavior of generations which they perceive as being role models). The analysis characterizes the life-cycle implications of assuming each one of the belief profiles and proposes an explanation for aggregate fluctuations in savings and consumption based on the cyclical renewal of beliefs across the mentioned states.

TI  - Tax Incentives and Private Saving in Sub-Saharan Africa: Using Taxation to Incentivize Saving
T2  - INTERTAX
AB  - Tax-based saving promotion programs are gaining global attention as a means of mobilizing funds for domestic investment, increasing employment levels, and consequently generating greater economic growth. Despite this, such programs have remained an exception in Sub-Saharan Africa. Whereas the study of saving promotion schemes in the region has been of high interest, no attempts have been made to study how tax policy could be used to augment these efforts. This article contributes to alleviating this deficiency by linking saving promotion schemes with tax policy. The authors use descriptive statistics of region- and country-specific data to assess Sub-Saharan Africa ' s private saving landscape and its current use of tax incentives. Through a systematic literature analysis, the article reveals heterogeneous challenges to private saving in the region subsequently leading to inherently low saving levels. Consequently, tax-policy interventions to boost savings in the region remain impractical, especially if the region ' s current political economy, business, and demographic environment remain the same. The key barriers to private saving are evaluated, and multidimensional policy suggestions are made for improving the use of tax -based incentives. While the policy recommendations have been specifically tailored for Sub-Saharan Africa ' s local socioeconomic circumstances, some of them may apply well to other low-middle-income countries (LMIC) that share similar or related characteristics.

T2  - MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to make an exploratory analysis of the impact of the entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) as defined by Acs et al. (2014) on opportunity-driven senior entrepreneurial activity in Latin America.Design/methodology/approachThe research uses data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute of five Latin America countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico), providing a total of 15,019 observations of people that are 50+ years old, between the years 2013 and 2017. A multi-level logistic regression model was used to estimate the relation between the total entrepreneurial activity by opportunity of seniors and some EE indicators. A total of three equations were estimated on the data set described.FindingsThis research confirms the relevance of some elements of EE on senior entrepreneurship in Latin America. Entrepreneurial attitudes have a positive relationship with senior entrepreneurs, generating higher levels of entrepreneurial ventures. The combination of institutions that support these attitudes on the EE enhances senior entrepreneurial activity. It also demonstrates that a higher level of entrepreneurial education at postschool stages is relevant to increasing senior entrepreneurial activity.Originality/valueThis research makes some interesting contributions in the field of measuring the impact of EE on senior entrepreneurship by opportunity in developing countries, filling a literature gap. It allows us to glimpse some measures that policymakers could take to improve the entrepreneurial activity of this segment in the region, such as implementing programs that facilitate networking opportunities and mentorship, along with providing training in business and financial literacy.

TI  - The role of regret and disappointment in the repurchase effect: Does gender matter?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper analyzes gender differences in the repurchase effect in an experiment based on Frydman and Camerer (2016). The results show that women exhibit a significantly higher repurchase effect than men. Specifically, women are more reluctant than men to repurchase a stock that increases in price following a prior sale. However, no significant gender difference in the repurchase of a sold stock that decreases in price is found. Furthermore, women are more strongly impacted than men by regret and disappointment from repurchasing a sold stock that increases in price, but no such impact exists from repurchasing a sold stock that decreases in price.

TI  - Wealth as a moderating effect on gender differences in portfolio holdings
T2  - GLOBAL FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - Using a unique data set of 6556 investment advisory clients at a large European wealth management institution we reveal how wealth trumps gender in determining the investment risk taking behaviour of women. While overall the advisory portfolios held by women contain less equity exposure and therefore have lower risk and return profiles than those held by men, this effect is attenuated when controlling for portfolio size. The portfolios of women with less than EUR200,000 invested contain higher equity allocations, i.e., more risk, and achieve greater returns, but they do not incur higher advisory fees compared to women with larger portfolios. These results confirm the moderating effect of wealth on gender. Furthermore, across both genders these smaller investors absorb more risk and have higher returning portfolios than investors with larger portfolios. Contributing to research on the role of gender in financial advice and investment decision making, our results are relevant to financial advisors and their clients.

TI  - Cognitive ability and household portfolio diversification: Evidence from China
T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - The low level of portfolio diversification is one of the potential high-cost deviations. Based on the data from the 2010 and 2012 China Family Panel Studies(CFPS), this paper empirically analyzes the impact of cognitive ability on the Chinese households portfolio diversification. The results show that cognitive ability has a significant positive effect on the diversification of household portfolio, including the more asset classes, the higher the diversification index of the portfolio, the greater the likelihood of buying a fund, and the higher the proportion of funds of the three assets. After considering the possible endogeneity, the effect of cognitive ability on the diversification of household portfolio is still significantly positive. Using different models, grouping by wealth and level of financial development, the results of this article are robust. We contribute by adding new evidence of diversified portfolio from emerging markets and expanding the scope of cognitive research.

TI  - Discriminants of risk tolerance among Indian investors: a dichotomous discriminant approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL AND FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING
AB  - Financial risk tolerance is dynamic in nature, differs across demographic considerations and depends on time horizon and is considered as the most vital factor of sustainable investment decision. The volatility of FRT poses major challenge for the investment industry in designing a suitable portfolio and advising an investor to invest in it based on the risk-taking ability to fulfil investment objective at micro-level. The existing study emphasises identification of causes of risk discrimination. Data source are primary and cross-sectional in nature, and collected from 552 investors selected from small cities. To assess the FRT classification dichotomous discriminant analysis was referred. The most striking finding of the study is the conforming discriminating factors for male and female. The discriminating factor classifying the males into risk taker or risk avoider was found to be the understanding of risk whereas for the females it was the understanding of returns.

TI  - Holding accounts in several banks-a conscious or reckless consumer?
T2  - ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB  - Service providers are in a fierce competition for their clients' loyalty, encouraging them to participate in loyalty programs or to install mobile applications. Split loyalty is becoming more popular on the banking services market. This means that customers are loyal to two or three companies or service providers by buying or using their products or services interchangeably. This phenomenon may be further explained by the liberalization of the banking sector, for example through the Payment Services Directive (PSD2). Whilst the unbanked are a commonly analyzed subject, the overbanked have not yet been examined in the literature. The aim of the current article is to answer the following question: is having accounts in multiple banks connected with customer recklessness or consumer awareness? The analysis carried out by the author of this paper shows that people who have accounts in many banks: are aware of the guaranteed amounts of deposits in banks operating in Poland, compare offers in different banks, and are less likely to be victims of phishing. Results show that awareness increases with respondents' age. Age is a variable which directly and indirectly affects the number of accounts held in different banks.

TI  - Understanding pension communications at the organizational level: Insights from bounded rationality theory & implications for HRM
T2  - HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - This paper applies concepts from bounded rationality theory to develop an integrative model to understand how pension scheme structure and pension scheme communication impact pension participation and contribution rates at organizational level. Organizational pension policies create framing effects that can have intended and unintended consequences depending on how they impact on employees' cognitive processes. Organizational pension communication policy impacts employee pension outcomes through the interaction between fast-acting, automatic System 1 and deliberative, calculating System 2 that typically endorses and occasionally overrides System 1 judgments. System 1 exhibits mental short-cuts (heuristics) and systematic biases. The likelihood of a System 2 challenge to System 1 depends on the persbnal, socio-demographic and economic characteristics of the individuals within the workforce. We propose that those within the HR function, who understand framing effects, can develop pension policies that positively affect pension plan outcomes at the organization level, specifically the pension participation and average contribution rates, using a combination of policies that in some cases promote System 2 endorsement and in other cases, System 2 engagement.

TI  - Investigating risk assessment in post-pandemic household cryptocurrency investments: an explainable machine learning approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASSET MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study provides an applicable methodological approach applying artificial intelligence (AI)-based supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms in risk assessment of post-pandemic household cryptocurrency investments and identifies the best performed ML algorithm and the most important risk assessment determinants. The empirical findings from analyzing 13 determinants from 1,000 dataset collected from major cryptocurrency communities online suggest that the logistic regression (LR) algorithm outperforms the remaining six ML algorithms by using performance metrics, lift chart, and ROC chart. Moreover, to make the ML algorithm results explainable and tackle the "black box " issue, the top five most important determinants are discovered, which are the interaction between investment amount and investment duration, investment amount, perception of traditional investments, cryptocurrency literacy, and perception of cryptocurrency volatility. The present study contributes to the literature on risk assessment, especially on the household cryptocurrency investments in the post-pandemic era and the body of knowledge on explainable supervised ML algorithms.

We find distinct differences in investors' attention and provide evidence that paying attention has a differential impact on performance depending on the type of information. Portfolio monitoring and attention to financial education are positively related to performance, while attention to analytical information is detrimental to performance. Attention to technical analysis is negatively related to the performance of actively trading investors but improves the performance of less frequent traders. Overall, our results provide additional evidence to the suggestion that attention to financial education is the key to investment success.

TI  - The early bird catches the retirement savings
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to investigate whether individuals' planning horizon influences their decision to save privately for their retirement. Design/methodology/approach Focussing on Spain, this empirical research uses the fifth wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)[1]. Logit models are estimated considering variables related to demographic characteristics, economic situation, education and cognitive abilities and psychological and social factors. Findings The results confirm that the planning horizon significantly influences the decision to save for retirement. Long-term planners are more likely to save for retirement than short-term planners. Originality/value Although previous literature has identified the planning horizon as a relevant variable in the decision to save for retirement, few empirical studies have evaluated their impact. This paper shows that it is important to develop habits of financial planning in societies, especially in societies with a prominent orientation towards the present.

TI  - Managing employees in Thai family firms: the mutuality perspective
T2  - MANAGEMENT RESEARCH REVIEW
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to adopt the mutuality perspective from the field of human resource management (HRM) to examine family firms, specifically human resource (HR) practices that are likely to be found in Thai family firms. Design/methodology/approach The cross-case analysis of three successful unreformed or authoritarian family firms in Thailand draws on semistructured interviews with top managers and/or HR managers as well as the employees of each family firm, field visits to each firm and a review of archival documents and Web-based resources. Findings This paper proposes that the recruitment of employees via alternative or substream recruitment channels (especially the recruitment of current employees' relatives or family members), paternalistic employee relations practices and the management of aging employees, specifically with regard to the absence of retirement age, the facilitation of financial planning, reduced workload, the appointment of mentors/advisors and the encouragement of aging employees to transfer knowledge to younger generations tend to be found across Thai family firms, especially the unreformed or authoritarian type. These HR practices are implemented across family firms because they help to manage high levels of debt that have accumulated over many years so that employees attain financial literacy before retirement and to foster and maintain positive relationships between managers and employees across firms. These positive relationships thus foster the retention of capable and loyal, aging employees who have been developed within the firm and who have worked with the firm for a long time (so-called Look-Mor), leading to the maintenance of tacit knowledge and experience within firms and the alleviation of the problem of labor shortage. Theoretically, this paper proposes that a family-like corporate culture typically found in family firms serves as the antecedent to the adoption and implementation of those HR practices (so-called culture determinism). In particular, the fit between corporate culture and HR practices is likely to foster the strong commitment among employees to firms and the feelings of job security among these employees (so-called commitment match in the mutuality of the employment relationship). Research limitations/implications An important limitation of this study concerns its methodology. Because this study is based on the case studies of only three unreformed or authoritarian family firms located in Thailand, the findings in this paper only propose substream or alternative HR practices that are likely to be found across Thai family firms; therefore, generalization to all other types of family firms and all other family firms across countries is not possible. Examining whether the HR practices proposed in this paper are uniquely found across family firms should be the subject of future research. Another limitation of this study is that it does not include firms located in other industries, such as the health-care industry and the hotel and restaurant industry. Future research could explore the HR practices implemented by family firms in these industries. Moreover, quantitative studies using large samples of family firms across industries might be useful in deepening the understanding of the HR practices implemented in family firms from the mutuality perspective on HRM. Practical implications This paper has practical implications for top managers and/or HR managers across firms not only in Thailand but also in other countries.
   First, top managers and/or HR managers across family firms, especially those of the unreformed or authoritarian type, should implement the HR practices proposed in this paper that are aligned well with a family-like corporate culture found in family firms to foster the strong commitment among employees to firms and the feeling of job security among these employees. Second, other types of firms (e.g. publicly owned corporations and multinational corporations) that do not have a family-like corporate culture may have to adapt some of these HR practices to their corporate culture and workplace atmosphere within their firms. Third, to manage and retain high-quality aging employees within firms, top managers and HR managers across various types of firms should implement some of the HR practices for managing aging employees proposed in this paper so that the firms can retain invaluable aging employees over time. Social implications This paper provides social/policy implications for the government and/or relevant public agencies of Thailand and of several other emerging market economies. These governments should encourage the firms located in their countries to implement some of the HR practices proposed in this paper to maintain and support knowledgeable and skillful aging employees in their firms. Originality/value This paper contributes to the two main bodies of literature on HRM and family business in the following ways. First, most previous studies on HRM have focused on the mainstream HR practices used in large firms while neglecting the alternative or substream HR practices used in family firms. Additionally, relatively little research has specifically examined the mutuality perspective with regard to HRM. Thus, this paper extends the literature on HRM and family business settings regarding HR practices that are likely to be found across Thai family firms, corporate culture as an antecedent of the adoption and implementation of those HR practices, and the fit between corporate culture and HR practices with respect to mutuality in the employment relationship. Moreover, the literature on HRM has typically overlooked the underresearched country of Thailand; most studies in this area have primarily focused on developed countries or other emerging market economies, including China and India. The findings of this paper provide an in-depth analysis of HR practices that are likely to be found in family firms located in the emerging market economy of Thailand according to the mutuality perspective with regard to HRM.

TI  - What leads people to tolerate negative interest rates on their savings?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Using an online experiment, we investigate intertemporal preferences to infer people's willingness to accept negative interest rates (NIRs) on their savings. We find some tolerance of NIRs, i.e., of people being willing to hold money in the bank rather than spend it, thereby accepting less savings at some future time. This tolerance strongly depends on the amount of savings, time horizon, actual savings behavior, and anchoring. Specifically, the higher the amount, the lower is the tolerance of NIRs, consistent with a reverse magnitude effect. Moreover, as the time horizon increases, the tolerance of NIRs decreases. Regular savers are more likely to tolerate NIRs than nonregular savers, which is consistent with status quo bias, higher familiarity with savings deposits, or a futureoriented mindset. We also find a higher tolerance of NIRs on savings when participants are anchored towards NIRs, i.e., when participants are first presented with NIRs and then with positive interest rates (PIRs).

TI  - Ambiguity aversion and experiential learning: implications for long-term savings decisions
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose This paper evaluates potential methods for reducing ambiguity surrounding returns on equity to improve long-term savings decisions. Design/methodology/approach We evaluate 221 undergraduate students in the US and first assess the degree of ambiguity aversion exhibited by individuals in the sample population as they decide between a risky (known probability) option and ambiguous (unknown probability) option pertaining to their chances of winning $0 or $1 in a hypothetical lottery. Similarly, we test whether sampling historical return data through learning modules influences long-term decision making regarding asset allocation within a retirement portfolio. Findings Allowing participants to experience the underlying probability through sampling significantly influences behavior, as participants were more likely to select the ambiguous option after sampling. Here, we also find that participants who receive interactive learning modules - which require users to manually alter the asset allocation to produce a sample of historical return data based on the specific allocation entered in the model - increase their post-learning equity allocations by 10.1% more than individuals receiving static modules. Interestingly, we find no significant evidence of ambiguity aversion playing a role in the asset allocation decision. Originality/value We find that decision-making related to ambiguous and risky options can be substantially influenced by experiential learning. Our study supplements previous literature, providing a link between research on the effect of ambiguity on stock market participation and implementation of educational programs to improve the asset allocation decision for young adults.

TI  - Retirement savings investment choices: Sophisticated or naive?
T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - We assess investment sophistication in a large sample of auto-enrolled, retirement plan member choices. A strong preference for using a small number of investment options is provided with little evidence, overall, to support equally weighted allocations. However, when multiple options are selected, one-third are equally weighted allocations and this is more prevalent when an easily divisible number of options are used. Positive learning is suggested in patterns of choices with sophisticated choice more likely in later choices. Possible consequences of menu framing, specifically menu size, do not support influence on effective asset allocations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Could the Theory of Planned Behaviour Explain Market Discipline in Sharia Mutual Funds?
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - A significant number of studies have explored market discipline as indicated by investors or customers being sensitive toward the excessive risks taken by banks. Yet no scholars have sought to review this topic from the behavioural finance perspective. This study defines market discipline as withdrawal behaviour, captured here using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) as one of the behavioural finance theories. This study aims to determine the psychological and social factors influencing market discipline from a behavioural perspective, by employing the TPB. This study's sample comprised of 93 academicians who invested in Sharia mutual funds in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. The results show that the intention to withdraw and perceived behavioural control (PBC) are able to predict the market discipline, while the intention to withdraw from Sharia mutual funds is determined by the subjective norms and PBC. Attitudes towards withdrawal are shown to be insignificant in explaining the intention to withdraw from Sharia mutual funds.5

TI  - Gender and Risk-Taking in the Building of US Retirement Wealth
T2  - ATLANTIC ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB  - The growing weight being placed on self-directed retirement accounts within the United States retirement income policy framework, and the time inconsistency challenge of individuals, particularly women, tending to under-invest in retirement savings accounts motivated the current work. Using data from the United States Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances, for a period spanning from 1989 to 2019, 11 cross-sections of data, the paper investigated the role of gender in United States retirement risk-taking investment strategies of single (never married) individuals. The analysis documented increasing trends in the risk-taking of both single women and single men but recorded differences in the risk-taking profiles of the two groups, with single men taking more risk than single women in their retirement wealth building in most cross-sections, with the gender risk-taking gap dropping, nonetheless, algebraically in magnitude from 1989 to 2019.

TI  - Choosing a Business or Economics Study Program at University: The Role of the Economics Teacher
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The choice of a study program is based on complex individual decision-making processes. Thereby, economics is one of the most popular fields of study worldwide. Considering previous studies, the role of the teacher is often neglected. However, it can be assumed that teachers' professional knowledge plays a significant role in a student's choice of a study program. Thus, the present study investigated the influence of the professional knowledge that students perceive in their economics teacher on their aspirations and choice of an economics study program. The longitudinal data of 1387 Swiss high school students were analyzed. Economic competencies were measured multidimensionally and included knowledge, motivation, interest, value-oriented dispositions, and attitude. There were small to moderate correlations between the professional knowledge that students perceived in their economics teacher and their economic competencies. With regard to the intention and choice of economics, the results show small to moderate effects of the pedagogic content knowledge and the general pedagogic knowledge that students perceive in their teacher. These findings contribute to the discussion on the role of the economics teacher. It is therefore recommended that the teaching professionalism of economics teachers, which has been criticized in different countries, be promoted more strongly and more systematically.

TI  - Variables Influencing Cryptocurrency Use: A Technology Acceptance Model in Spain
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The first commercial transaction with the first cryptocurrency in 2010 marked the start of a revolution in transactions. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies will dramatically transform how we do transactions, just as the Internet revolutionized how we communicate. Currently, more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies are quoted on the market, and many more are being launched in initial coin offerings for use as an exchange method in a specific business ecosystem or as rights to assets or liabilities. As an emerging fintech, cryptocurrencies open up many opportunities, but they also pose significant challenges and limitations. This paper analyzes the key factors for the successful development of a cryptocurrency from a consumer-behavior perspective. Using a technology acceptance theoretical framework, we test a model able to explain almost 85% of the intention to use cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly, risk was not a significant factor. This could be because most of the respondents considered operating with cryptocurrencies to be risky; the lack of variability in their responses to the questions about perceived risk would explain this lack of explanatory power. However, willingness to manage cryptocurrency risk could be a precondition for adoption. The performance expectancy for a given cryptocurrency was the most important factor for its success. The research was conducted in Spain with college-educated adults with basic knowledge of the Internet.

TI  - SELECTED FACTORS OF CORPORATE MANAGEMENT IN SMEs SECTOR
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - The study aims to define and present important factors affecting the quality of company management in the SMEs sector. Within the realized research, the authors focused on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. In the CR, the data from 454 companies were obtained, and from 368 companies in Slovakia. For data processing, chi-squared test and Z-score were used. The research results provided interesting findings. It has been found that entrepreneurs spend a lot of time doing their business activities, since about 70% of entrepreneurs in both countries confirmed that they spend more than 8 hours a day doing their business activities. On the other hand, the authors' assumptions were not confirmed, as higher intensity in entrepreneurship had been expected. An interesting finding was that larger and older companies more intensively agreed with the statement ST1 - they work intensively in their business (management). About three quarters of the entrepreneurs interviewed stated that they apply the participative management style. Based on the results, it can be stated that larger companies, older companies, and university-educated entrepreneurs largely apply this management style. The research has shown that entrepreneurs greatly appreciate people in their enterprises, which is more clearly evident in older companies than in younger companies. A large proportion of entrepreneurs pay considerable attention to regular employee evaluation and try to motivate them to apply innovative workflows.

TI  - How endogenous risk preferences and sample selection affect analysis of firm survival
T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - The roles of selection and endogeneity in measured risk preferences are illustrated using the correlation between risk attitudes and firm survival. Selection bias occurs when risk attitudes are elicited only from current entrepreneurs so that the risk attitudes of unsuccessful entrepreneurs are excluded from the analysis. Risk attitudes measured after agents enter entrepreneurship will endogenously reflect business success. Data on entrepreneurs from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics shows that when risk attitudes are measured subject to selection and endogeneity, mixed or even positive correlations between risk acceptance and the probability of firm exit occur. However, firm exits fall monotonically with willingness to accept risk when risk preference measures are not subject to selection or endogeneity related to business success.

AB  - On average, boys score higher on math achievement tests and girls score higher in reading; these gaps increase between primary and secondary school. Using PISA, PIRLS, and TIMSS data, we investigate the role of early educational tracking (sorting students into different types of secondary schools at an early age) on gender gaps in test achievement in a cross-country difference-in-differences framework. We find strong evidence that early tracking increases gender differences in reading. For math test scores, we do not find consistent evidence that early tracking contributes to the gender gap.

TI  - Women's Entrepreneurship and Government Policy: Facilitating Access to Credit through a National Program in Chile
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - In this paper, I evaluate the impact of a multidimensional national program implemented in Chile during the second term of President Bachelet to facilitate female entrepreneurs' access to credit, reduce gender gaps in financial inclusion, and change patriarchal stereotypes. I construct a difference-in-difference estimate of the program. My findings indicate that the program has successfully met its principal aim: the loans granted to women have increased, reducing the gender gap in this dimension. In addition, evidence of heterogeneity by the economic sector has emerged. This evidence aligns with prior research that has emphasised that public policies should not be designed and implemented under the logic of "one type of program fits all". The program analysed in this study is an example of a national public policy that has improved female entrepreneurs' access to funding, reduced gender gaps in a Latin American country, and potentially offered lessons to other Latin American and middle-income countries worldwide.

TI  - The Effect of Providing Peer Information on Retirement Savings Decisions
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - Using a field experiment in a 401(k) plan, we measure the effect of disseminating information about peer behavior on savings. Low-saving employees received simplified plan enrollment or contribution increase forms. A randomized subset of forms stated the fraction of age-matched coworkers participating in the plan or age-matched participants contributing at least 6% of pay to the plan. We document an oppositional reaction: the presence of peer information decreased the savings of nonparticipants who were ineligible for 401(k) automatic enrollment, and higher observed peer savings rates also decreased savings. Discouragement from upward social comparisons seems to drive this reaction.

TI  - Awareness among employees towards investment products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - The study aims to explore the awareness of various investment products and evaluate the effect of demographic and socio-economic factors on the awareness of investment products among government employees in Haryana, India. Primary data have been collected from 394 government employees with the help of a self-structured questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis has been used to extract the dimensions of investment product awareness. One-way ANOVA and t-test have been used to identify the influence of demographic and socio-economic factors on investment product awareness. Exploratory factor analysis extracted eight dimensions of investment product awareness. The result showed that age significantly influences the awareness of all investment products except for balance growth products. However, education has a significant effect only on the awareness of risk-averse products. The awareness level of employees covered under different pension schemes is significantly different in risk-averse products, specific purpose products, and NPS.

TI  - Input, Outcome, and Impact: A Program-Informed Model to Improve the Effectiveness of Corporate Social Marketing
T2  - SOCIAL MARKETING QUARTERLY
AB  - Background: The purpose of this research is to extend Corporate Social Marketing (CSM) literature and provide practitioners with a framework that can be used in different contexts, as the existing literature lacks an understanding of what factors determine the success of a CSM program and understand the interplay between cross-sector partnerships, CSM, and societal outcomes and impact delivery. Companies are taking a greater interest in addressing social issues, utilizing innovative CSR approaches such as CSM to promote behavior change among their audience while matching their core strengths and attributes (Kotler et al., 2012).
   Focus of the Article: The article evaluates how the CSM programMein Pragati developed lasting behavior change and seeks to develop a conceptual model around its success.
   Research Question: How can the CSM contribute to behavior change programs?
   Program Design/Approach Importance to the Social Marketing Field: The proposed model (Input, Outcome, and Impact Model of Program Development) provides a structured approach to building a CSM program that changes behavior and develops mutual benefit between corporations, government, and nonprofits.
   Methods: Using a case study approach, this paper analyzes a successful financial inclusion program, Mein Pragati of a global analytics company, CRISIL, and its CSR arm. The three studies (in-depth interviews with eight management members, in-depth interviews with 82 Sakhis (peer educators) and their spouses, and 248 survey interviews with beneficiaries reveal the connection between program development, social outcomes, and societal impact.
   Results: Based on the findings of the three studies, the cross-sector Input, Output, and Outcome Model of the Program Development proposes ways to build effective CSR interventions. Individually, the findings from the in-depth interviews provide a thematic overview of CSM's success, peer educator interviews identify the impact and outcomes of Mein Pragati, and beneficiary interviews demonstrate program success. Recommendations for Research and Practice: Future research can empirically test the Input, Outcome, and Impact Model of Program Development, as further exploration of CSM is needed to understand how the concepts of people, planet, and profits can mutually benefit and provide both behavioral and societal change within program development.

TI  - Determinants of risky buy-now-pay-later intentions and behaviors of Vietnamese students
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - This study explores psychological and social factors that contribute to risky buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) intentions and behaviors among college students. This study was designed quantitatively and surveyed 1147 students in Vietnam. The partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. The results indicate that students with greater knowledge about financial risk are more likely to avoid risky BNPL behaviors. In contrast, students who have a positive attitude toward risk consumer credit and an external locus of control tend to favor risky BNPL. Additionally, the external locus of control plays a role in moderating the predictive relationship between risky BNPL intention and behavior. Finally, this study also found a difference in the effect level of the factors between groups of students divided by gender and major.

TI  - Are individual investors liquidity providers around earnings announcements? Evidence from an emerging market
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - We first document that both buying and selling by individual investors before earnings announcements are negatively correlated with post-event abnormal returns using a unique dataset that allows us to precisely identify individual investor trading. Next, we show that both buying and selling by individual investors before earnings announcements not only are positively associated with contemporaneous returns, but also respond positively to past returns. This is consistent with the idea that individual investors act as liquidity providers (demanders) when they sell (buy) before earnings announcements. Individual investor buying and individual investor selling after earnings announcements confirm this point.

TI  - Assessing the demand for micropensions among India's poor
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF AGEING
AB  - Using new data from a field experiment in India, we test hypotheses about micropension design in a poor population. We elicit demand for the basic micropension in addition to variants with different minimum withdrawal ages, government match rates, and options for lump sum withdrawal. A majority (80%) of respondents report interest in the micropension, and the amount they are willing to contribute would be enough to cover about 40% of expected old-age consumption. We find that prospective policyholders value the inability to access the assets until a particular age. We also find that they respond positively to the government match rate.

TI  - Entrepreneurial Motivation, Competency and Micro-Enterprise Sustainability Performance: Evidence from an Emerging Economy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Small to medium-sized enterprises suffer from loss of competitive advantage, low productivity, and poor performance because of inadequate competencies. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to examine the effect of selected motivational dimensions (i.e., self-improvement, self-confidence, openness to change, pull factors, and the need for achievement) on entrepreneurial competency among micro-entrepreneurs. We used a cross-sectional design and collected quantitative data from 403 micro-entrepreneurs in Malaysia using random sampling. SEM-PLS was used for data analysis. The findings revealed that self-confidence, openness to change, and pull factors positively influenced entrepreneurial competencies. Moreover, there was a positive effect of self-confidence, pull factors, need for achievement, and entrepreneurial competency on enterprise sustainability performance. Furthermore, entrepreneurial competencies significantly mediated the effect of self-confidence, openness to change, and pull factors on enterprise sustainability performance. Apart from extending the lens of a resource-based view, this study enriches enterprise sustainability literature from emerging nations' perspective. Policymakers can strengthen their programs and policies to improve the entrepreneurial competencies of micro-entrepreneurs and their business sustainability.

TI  - Unlearning investment biases
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - This study considers two causes-inexperience and overreaction to price movements-of a well-established phenomenon on the stock market called "excessive trading": large trading volumes leading to decreased net portfolio returns via increased transaction costs. Creating a stylized hold or trade-scenario in a computer laboratory experiment, I confirm both inexperience and overreaction as robust drivers of trading activity. The 2 x 2 experimental design featuring overlapping treatments enables me to disentangle the two direct effects from their interaction. The results show no signs of dependencies between the two channels, suggesting that psychological distortions are immutable personal characteristics that cannot be unlearned.

TI  - THE NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR RETIREMENT FUNDING ADEQUACY: A FUZZY SET ANALYSIS
T2  - ECONOMICS & SOCIOLOGY
AB  - Although retirement funding adequacy literature has explored perceptions of retirement preparations and savings targets, there remains a lack of understanding of which conditions are necessary and sufficient for it to occur. This study identifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for retirement funding adequacy by examining the extent to which demographic, psychological and behavioural variables predict its occurrence. Within the context of South Africa, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis was used to test a complex model and qualify the processes that lead to retirement funding adequacy. The results show that educated women of higher socio-economic status are associated with retirement provisions. Thus, the inclusion and empowerment of women in financial planning activities results in positive retirement outcomes. Furthermore, retirement provisions precede retirement funding adequacy, and financial knowledge is a necessary condition for both retirement provisions and retirement funding adequacy. This research is relevant for financial planners and institutions encouraging individuals to plan and save for retirement in order to reduce the retirement funding adequacy gap experienced by retirees.

TI  - Individual differences and cognitive reflection across gender and nationality the case of the United Arab Emirates
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This study aims to investigate the effect of gender differences and nationality on the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), as well as behavioural biases. A sample of 770 questionnaires was collected from undergraduate business students in public and private universities across the United Arab Emirates. The results suggested that low CRT values were dominant in males and females alike for non-UAE citizens in the age group of 18-22 years old, of whom at least one of the parents had a college degree. Subjects with higher cognitive reflection scores were signi?cantly more likely to exhibit overcon?dence, risk preference, and risk illiteracy. In addition, females scored lower than males, and non-UAE citizens scored higher than local citizens in the CRT. However, further analysis of the interaction between gender and nationality revealed that local females scored on average higher than non-UAE females.

TI  - Goal Setting and Saving in the FinTech Era
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - We study the effectiveness of saving goals in increasing individuals' savings using data from a Fintech app. Using a difference-in-differences identification strategy that randomly assigns users into a group of beta testers who can set goals and a group of users who cannot, we find that setting goals increases individuals' savings rate. The increased savings within the app do not reduce savings outside the app. Moreover, goal setting helps those individuals previously identified as having the lowest propensity to save. Matching App user survey responses to their behavior highlights the relative merits of monitoring and concreteness channels in explaining our findings.

TI  - Individual investors' sophistication and expectations of risk and return
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between individual investors' level of sophistication and their expectations of risk and return in the stock market.
   Design/methodology/approach The author combines survey and registry data on individual investors in Sweden to obtain 11 sophistication proxies that previous research has related to individuals' financial decisions. These proxies are related to a survey measure regarding individual investors' expectations of risk and return in an index fund using linear regressions.
   Findings The findings in this paper indicate that sophisticated investors have lower risk and higher return expectations that are closer to objective measures than those of less-sophisticated investors.
   Originality/value These results are important, since they enhance the understanding of the underlying mechanisms through which sophistication can influence financial decisions.

TI  - Diversification Perspectives of a Single Equity Market: Analysis on the Example of Selected CEE Countries
T2  - COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC RESEARCH-CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
AB  - The study addresses the benefits of a unified stock market in terms of diversification risk for the eight CEE stock markets. For this purpose, each stock market was treated as a separate portfolio based on the companies listed during 2018-2019. Portfolio diversification techniques were used to identify risk linked with the eight Central Eastern European stock markets. The results show that the stock market with the lowest diversification risk was the Bulgarian Stock Exchange, followed by the Prague Stock Exchange, the Ljubljana Stock Exchange, and at the end stands the Zagreb Stock Exchange. The portfolio constructed from the Zagreb Stock Exchange carries the highest portfolio risk, but it also offers the highest weekly weighted average returns. Stock markets that benefit in terms of portfolio risk from unification are the Bratislava Stock Exchange, the Budapest Stock Exchange, the Bucharest Stock Exchange, the Warsaw Stock Exchange, and the Zagreb Stock Exchange. The indexes where the portfolio risk increases at the time of unification are the Bulgarian Stock Exchange, the Ljubljana Stock Exchange, and the Prague Stock Exchange. From a managerial perspective, financial investors get a novel outlook on the diversification possibilities offered within a hypothetical unified CEE stock market.

TI  - Determinants of Indebtedness: Influence of Behavioral and Demographic Factors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - This study aims to examine the influence of behavioral and demographic factors on indebtedness by constructing a model using specific determinants. The exploratory method is used through the partial least square (SmartPLS) technique, by surveying 320 respondents in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A self-administered questionnaire was administered to respondents, addressing both demographic and behavioral factors. The results confirmed four of the eight hypotheses stated. Among the determinants, risk perception had a highly significant relationship with both materialism and emotion, while indebtedness had a relationship with emotion and materialism. The findings also indicated that significant differences exist between indebtedness and behavioral factors on the basis of gender, marital status, age, income, and dependence on credit cards and loans. The results may assist various economic players to design better models for credit offerings and address the credit problem in the long term.

TI  - On the Impact of Regulating Commissions: Evidence from the Indian Mutual Funds Market
T2  - WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Commissions-motivated agents have historically helped the development of many markets, but research suggests brokers motivated by commissions sometimes steer consumers towards inappropriate products. This issue is particularly important in household financial markets where consumers may be unable to evaluate products on their own. While reforms attempting to limit commission payments have been undertaken worldwide, little research has evaluated the impact of these reforms. We study a major Indian investor protection reform that attempted to reduce commissions tied to mutual fund sales by banning the distribution fees that mutual funds had previously earmarked for commissions. We analyze the policy impact by comparing funds charging high versus low distribution fees pre-reform and find no evidence that the reform itself reduced fund flows. We argue that the most plausible explanation is that the Indian asset management industry maintained substantial commissions to brokers through other revenue sources apart from the banned distribution fees.

TI  - The Ant and the Grasshopper: Understanding Personal Saving Orientation of Consumers
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB  - A low savings rate is a persistent social issue with significant present and future ramifications. As an alternative to conceptualizing saving money as goal-directed behavior, the present research examines the chronic tendencies of people to save money in a consistent and sustained manner through a personal saving orientation (PSO). Drawing upon theorizing on action control and research on forming and maintaining habits, the PSO emphasizes consistent, sustainable saving activities and incorporating them into one's lifestyle. In a set of nine studies, the PSO scale is developed and its nomological, test-retest, discriminant, and predictive validities are established. The results also show that the PSO moderates the relationship between consumers' financial knowledge and their accumulated savings. Additionally, low-PSO consumers are responsive to an intervention to help them save money. The PSO offers an effective method for understanding differences between consumers in their financial decision making and behaviors, and it can be used as a guide to encourage consistent and sustained saving practices.

TI  - The establishment of transactive memory system in distributed agile teams engaged in AI-related knowledge work
T2  - JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeAs a kind of knowledge-intensive team coordinated across physical distance, it is necessary to construct a meta-knowledge driven transactive memory system (TMS) for the knowledge management of distributed agile team (DAT). This study aims to explore the comprehensive antecedents of TMS establishment in DATs and considers how TMS establishment is affected by herding behavior under the artificial intelligence (AI)-related knowledge work environment that emerges with technology penetration. Design/methodology/approachThe data derived from 177 students of 52 DATs in a well-known Chinese business school, which were divided into 26 traditional knowledge work groups and 26 AI-related task groups to conduct a random comparative experiment. The ordinary least squares method was used to analyze the conceptual model and ANOVA was used to examine the differences in herding behavior between the control groups (traditional knowledge work DATs) and treatment groups (DATs engaged in AI-related knowledge work). FindingsThe results showed that knowledge diversity, professional knowledge, self-efficacy and social system use had significantly positive effects on the establishment of TMS. Interestingly, the authors also find that herding behavior may promote the process of establishing TMS of the new team, and this effect will be more significant when AI tasks are involved in team knowledge work. Originality/valueBy exploring the comprehensive antecedents of the establishment of TMS, this study provided a theoretical basis for knowledge management of DATs, especially in AI knowledge work teams. From a practical perspective, when the DAT is involved in AI-related knowledge works, managers should appropriately guide the convergence of employees' behaviors and use the herding effects to accelerate the establishment of TMS, which will improve team knowledge sharing and innovation.

TI  - Investment behaviour of women entrepreneurs
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the new kind of investors women entrepreneurs and to find out the factors that drive their investment behaviour and investment decisions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach of qualitative enquiry was used for the research in which 18 in-depth exploratory interviews were conducted to identify the determinants of the investment behaviour shown by women entrepreneurs, a growing segment in investment. The accumulated data was analysed using open coding.
   Findings - The research show that en entrepreneurs consider investment as a. long-term instrument are risk averse and quite conservative. They are willing to take risks in business but not for making investment decisions. The reasons for this low-risk behaviour include lack of time to understand investments and lack of knowledge about various products. The research asserts that if they spend time to be informed about the nuances of investment instruments, they are likely to take risks for their investments as well. The interviews also reflect that women entrepreneurs often mimic the investment behaviour of their parents.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample for this research was taken from only two cities in India and a broader research in other cities as well will expand the understanding of investment behaviours demonstrated by women entrepreneurs. The differences in women entrepreneurs investment behaviour due to culture and ethnicity of the respondent are also not considered.
   Practical implications - The outcomes of the research will help the investment manager to get a better insight into the psychology of women entrepreneurs as investors. This will help them develop personalized and relevant portfolio recommendations. Second, the findings will help service providers to develop training modules for their investment advisors by sensitizing them to needs and wants of women entrepreneurs as potential investors. Third, the research will be of interest for policymakers and researchers to understand the determinants of personal investment decision-making amongst women entrepreneurs. Finally, it will help women entrepreneurs understand and mitigate their biases while taking investment decisions. It will lead them to take wiser investment decisions, thereby reducing the risk and maximizing opportunities of returns.
   Social implications - The research will provide opportunities for enhancing gender equality amongst investors. This can be achieved by educating the investment advisors on the traits and preferences of women entrepreneurs as investors. Designing and delivering specific workshops on investment awareness for women entrepreneurs can also be accomplished based on the findings of this research.
   Originality/value - To the researcher's best knowledge, the investment behaviour of women entrepreneurs in India has been little investigated. This study appears to be the first qualitative 'research attempt in that direction. This paper will be useful in understanding he behavioural biases by women entrepreneurs in considering their personal investment decisions.

TI  - Switching between superannuation funds: Does performance and marketing matter?
T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - This study examines the roles of fund performance and marketing in superannuation members' fund switching activity in Australia. Using member-nominated transfers from a unique data set of Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)-regulated superannuation funds from 2005 to 2014, our results indicate that members who switched funds do not chase after superior short-term returns but they do punish bad performers by withdrawing investments. We find a consistent positive relation between marketing effort and investor choice for retail funds, which engage in extensive marketing. However, marketing does not appear to be an effective strategy for industry-based funds to attract investments.

TI  - Comparing factors affecting Chinese institutional investors' willingness to pay for green bonds in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Previous studies on green bonds (GBs) in China have not extensively analyzed how investor characteristics such as demographic background and environmental concerns affect Chinese investors' decisions to invest in GBs. Therefore, these aspects should be examined to understand the GB market and its potential expansion. To address this gap, this study analyzed how Chinese institutional investors' social attributes, environmental concerns, and residential locations affect their decisions to purchase GBs. The ordered-probit model estimation revealed that experience in investing in GBs and high environmental awareness lowers the yield required for institutional investors to invest in GBs, suggesting that these factors increase investors' willingness to pay (WTP) for GBs. The study also finds that investors in Shanghai have a higher WTP for GBs than those in Beijing and Shenzhen. The results provide important insights for the government and financial authorities to implement measures aimed at increasing institutional investors' interest in the environment. Additionally, these results can drive GB issuers to promote sales to institutional investors with an environmental focus.

TI  - Self-control and debt decisions relationship: evidence for different credit options
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - In recent years, households have become increasingly indebted, which constitutes a matter of concern. Based on a sample from the Spanish Survey of Financial Competences, this paper examines the relationship between self-control and consumer borrowing behaviour and, in so doing, it proposes a new multi-item scale of individual's self-control in financial matters and considers several types of consumer debt, thus overcoming the main gaps identified in previous research. Empirical evidence reveals that, overall, self-control problems lead to more indebtedness. However, comprehensive analyses have demonstrated that the influence of self-control differs across an exhaustive range of credit options. In this regard, the lack of self-control increases the probability of taking out unsecured personal loans, loans from family or friends, and credit card use. Evidence suggests that individuals' first impulse leads them to ask their social circle for a loan. Overall, individuals might be tempted to get indebted when they cannot make ends meet. However, this first impulse usually faces barriers from the supply perspective, so the evidence suggests that the effect of self-control on borrowing decisions might be shaped not only by the demand side of credit but also by the supply one.

TI  - The Coholding Puzzle: New Evidence from Transaction-Level Data
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - Why do individuals pay debt interest when they could use their savings to pay down the debt? We explore why individuals "cohold" debt and savings using detailed and highly disaggregated daily-level data on household finances. We find that coholding mostly occurs in short spells within the month and the level of coholding is typically modest. Periods of coholding are not associated with shocks at the individual level. We show that mental accounting has a role to play in explaining coholding, in particular how individuals allocate different categories of expenditure to accounts in credit and debit.

TI  - Cash or m-Payment? The Dilemma of Payment Behaviour During the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic represented an unexpected shock to the global economy, with a significant impact on business and consumer behaviour, particularly on spending and payments. This article aims to identify the drivers affecting consumers' payment behaviour in Italy during the COVID-19 lockdown. We develop an empirical study, using structural equation modelling on data collected from 2,872 consumers in the period May 2020-June 2020 through the computer-assisted web interviewing methodology. A robustness check is run with an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis. The findings highlight the positive and significant effect of COVID-19 worries on consumers' payment behaviour. The uniqueness of this work derives from the creative approach with which it investigates the financial and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis and focuses on possible solutions to encourage the adoption of innovative tools.

TI  - The rationality of rainy day savers: objective and subjective determinants of individual savings in Britain
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Using the largest and richest data on savings in Great Britain, six waves of the Wealth and Assets Survey from the Office for National Statistics, we compare standard life cycle models of saving with models using more 'subjective' measures, and the added dimension of longitudinal data. Whilst the life cycle model provides a benchmark, regular criticisms remain, particularly people's propensity to continue saving at older ages. Data on attitudes attenuate that issue, and panel data largely eliminate it. Our results confirm empirically, for Great Britain, the importance of some of the objective determinants of savings included in life cycle theory. When we look at more subjective ones, we show that other factors, including self-rated health and financial pressure, provide an enhanced direct explanation of the propensity to save. Individuals who regard themselves as 'rainy day savers' tended to save more, irrespective of their demographic or financial circumstances. Results are robust to different specifications.

TI  - Heterogeneity in households' expectations of housing prices - evidence from micro data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOUSING ECONOMICS
AB  - Expectations about future housing prices are arguably an important determinant of actual housing prices, and an important input in decisions on whether and how to transact in the housing market. Using micro-level survey data on Swedish households, we analyse households' expectations of housing prices and how these expectations relate to the characteristics of the respondents. Results show that age is found to be significantly related to housing-price expectations, with the youngest households - whose adulthood largely corresponds to the extended period of rapid housing-price growth in Sweden - having the highest housing-price expectations. This is consistent with the hypothesis that expectations are influenced by personal experiences. Our findings suggest that aggregate measures of expectations might hide important features of the data, which could be of interest to policy makers when choosing regulatory actions or formulating macroprudential policies.

TI  - Credit Cards: Transactional Convenience or Debt-Trap?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCE
AB  - We survey individuals on their credit card usage. Contrary to popular press, most credit card holders use credit cards in a responsible manner. They tend to use credit cards for transaction convenience and pay little interest. Only a minor subset of people uses credit cards to access expensive credit, with only 7% of credit card holders in our sample never paying the balance in full. Credit card debt is more common among older, less financially literate, and less trusting respondents. Even individuals with credit card debt are well aware about its costs and are likely to make informed financial choices.

TI  - How mindfulness reduces BNPL usage and how that relates to overall well-being
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to examine how mindfulness reduces consumers' buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) payment scheme usage and how that relates to their overall well-being. Design/methodology/approachThis study uses partial least squares structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses of a conceptual framework which is rooted in the extant literature, using an approximately representative sample of Australian consumers (N = 275). FindingsThis study finds empirical evidence for the ability of mindfulness to reduce BNPL usage through increasing consumers' financial self-control and decreasing their impulse buying tendency. This study also obtains empirical evidence that greater BNPL usage is associated with lower subjective evaluations of consumers' overall well-being by increasing their current money management stress and decreasing their expected future financial security. Research limitations/implicationsFuture research could build on the effect of mindfulness that the authors find in this study and how it could be leveraged as a protective mechanism for consumers' financial decision-making. Such research could involve mindfulness-based interventions, such as instant messaging within smartphone applications. Doing so would also help assess causality, thus addressing the limitation of the cross-sectional nature of this study. Practical implicationsThe findings have implications for public policymakers and business practitioners. Financial counselors are encouraged to include the measurement of personality traits such as impulse buying tendency and financial self-control in intake meetings with clients and consider the benefits of offering short mindfulness training. Given the negative effect of BNPL usage on consumers' financial and overall well-being, and the reputational risks this implies, BNPL providers are recommended to take more responsibility to ensure consumers do not fall into a debt trap, while retailers are advised to take steps to make payment processes more "mindful." Originality/valueAlthough mindfulness has established effects on consumer behavior, its beneficial influence on consumer financial decision-making has rarely been explored. This study also contributes to a better understanding of the antecedents and consequences of consumers' BNPL payment scheme usage. Although its prominence is increasing in daily life, and despite the concerns of consumer advocates, policymakers and regulators regarding its risks, the topic of consumers' BNPL usage has received little attention in academic research so far. Finally, this study extends the emerging financial well-being literature by demonstrating how BNPL usage can reduce consumers' overall well-being through the mediating effect of increasing current money management stress and decreasing expected future financial security.

TI  - Testing methods to enhance longevity awareness
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Many people do not understand the concepts of life expectancy and longevity risk, poten-tially leading them to under-save for retirement or to not purchase longevity insurance, which in turn could reduce wellbeing at older ages. We investigate alternative ways to in-crease the salience of both concepts, allowing us to assess whether these change peoples' perceptions and financial decision making. Using randomly-assigned vignettes providing subjects with information about either life expectancy or longevity, we show that merely prompting people to think about financial decisions changes their perceptions regarding subjective survival probabilities. Moreover, this information also boosts respondents' inter-est in saving and demand for longevity insurance. In particular, longevity information in-fluences both subjective survival probabilities and financial decisions, while life expectancy information influences only annuity choices. We provide some evidence that many people are simply unaware of longevity risk.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Less is not more: 401(k) plan information and retirement planning choices
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This paper presents the results of a choice experiment that is designed to examine whether changing how plan information is presented affects planned retirement-savings behavior. The main hypothesis is that providing plan information in a more concise format with helpful recommendations, rather than providing lengthy and detailed information, will alter retirement-planning choices. The specific choices examined include: whether to enroll, how much to contribute, and how to structure (broadly) the asset allocation. The choice experiment is conducted on three different samples: (i) a Qualtrics panel of new employees, (ii) a Qualtrics panel of job seekers, and (iii) a sample of business-school students. Our results suggest that, controlling for demographic and other factors, our main hypothesis was not supported by the data in any of the samples. Thus, the data cast some doubt on the notion that simplifying and condensing the retirement-plan information presented to employees will result in vastly different retirement-planning choices.

TI  - Specifying and validating overconfidence bias among retail investors: a formative index
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - PurposeThe study explored various dimensions of overconfidence bias (OB) among retail investors in Indian financial markets. Further, these dimensions were validated through formative assessments for OB.Design/methodology/approachThe study applied exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to 764 respondents to explore dimensions of OB. These were validated with formative assessments on 489 respondents by the partial least square path modeling (PLS-PM) approach in SmartPLS 4.0 software.FindingsThe major findings of EFA explored four dimensions for OB, i.e. accuracy, perceived control, positive illusions and past investment success. The formative assessments revealed that positive illusions followed by past investment success among retail investors played an instrumental role in orchestrating the OBs that affect investment decisions in financial markets.Practical implicationsThe formative index of OB has several practical implications for registered financial and investment advisors, bank advisors, business media companies and portfolio managers, besides individual investors in the domain of behavioral finance.Originality/valueThis research provides a novel approach to provide a formative index of OB with four dimensions. This formative index can acts as an overview for upcoming researchers to investigate the OB of retail individual investors.Highlights Overconfidence bias is an important predictor of retail investors' behaviorFormative dimensions of the overconfidence bias index.Accuracy, perceived control, positive illusions and past investment success are important dimensions of overconfidence bias.Modern portfolio theory and illusion of control theory support this study.

TI  - Are annuities an inferior or normal good? Evidence from a less-developed country
T2  - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB  - One crucial decision made at retirement in Chile is whether to acquire an annuity or a phased withdrawal (PW) scheme. Annuities, unlike PW, do not allow for inheritance and provide smaller initial pension benefits while protecting against longevity and capital market risks. If preferences show decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA), then an annuity (insurance) should be considered an inferior good. We test this hypothesis on Chilean data using a binary choice model. Our results reject the DARA hypothesis for the whole sample. However, after splitting the sample into low- and high-income groups, we find that the former have increasing absolute risk aversion (IARA) behavior, whereas the latter have DARA behavior. These findings suggest that policy programs encouraging retirement savings, such as tax breaks and subsidies, should be approached with caution depending on the balance of high and low-income individuals, particularly in less-developed economies.

TI  - Does Awareness and Demographics Really Influence the Investment Motives of Working Women? -An Empirical Analysis
T2  - GURUKUL BUSINESS REVIEW-GBR
AB  - Purpose-Active participation of females in the economic activities has brought independence to them on social as well as economic front (Census 2011, chapter 4). This economic independency brought an emphatic wisdom in them for financial planning backed by certain motives. The present study is an attempt to find out the variables that influences the investment motives of economically empowered females.
   Design/methodology/approach-The present study is conducted on a random sample of 300 females from National Capital region of India those who are either working or have some temporary break from their work. A questionnaire put in use to collect their responses. Further factor analysis executed in order to have meaningful component through principle component analysis. Finally cross sectional regression used to find out the impact of selected demographic variables on investment motives i.e Safety & Growth of funds and specific future planning.
   Findings-It is found Safety & Growth of funds and specific future planning are two significant investment motives of the working females and both the investment motives significantly explained by the level of education and awareness of financial products.
   Research limitations/implications: The study has considered the NCR region and working females only.
   Practical implications-Companies who sells financial products by looking at the investment motives and the risk appetite of females can develop financial products in line of their investment motives.
   Originality/value-The study conferred the variables that indicate investment motives of working females such as Safety & Growth of funds & and specific future planning. It also pinpoints the impact of demographics on investment motives.

TI  - The Influence of Social Models on Retirement Savings: Evidence for European Countries
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - Population ageing, together with the negative effects of the recent economic and financial crisis that some European countries are still facing, have threatened the sustainability of public pension systems. In this context, voluntary private pensions have emerged as the most feasible alternative to supplement the minimum provided by Social Security Systems; however, this financial product does not enjoy its expected popularity. A potential explanation of this reality might be due to the fact that European countries are far from being homogeneous, nor their pensions systems. Therefore, any policy geared toward improving financial retirement planning should take into account these potential differences. As a first approach to their analysis, this paper proposes the existence of four different 'social models' in Europe -namely, Continental, Mediterranean, Nordic and Transitional-. Overall, empirical evidence confirmed the significant influence of country' 'social model' on the decision to invest in retirement accounts on a sample of 31,468 individuals in 2013. It was also proved that this decision is positively related to age, household income and wealth, higher levels of formal education, job situation, good health status, and long-term planning horizons; and negatively related to age squared, household size or financial risk aversion. In short, future policies and reforms regarding private pensions should not only take into account the existence of individual differences among Europeans, but also the existence of differences depending on institutional and cultural country factors.

TI  - Effects of informational nudges on consumer debt repayment behaviors
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This study examines the impact of billing disclosure changes mandated by the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act on consumers' decisions about their monthly credit card debt repayments. The study uses data from a nationally representative monthly survey of households from June 2006 through December 2011. Estimates show that the CARD Act disclosures were effective in inducing households to increase the amounts of credit card debt paid off each month, with the strongest effects seen in the proportion of households who pay off balances in full each month. Among households who continue to carry credit card debt, there is minimal evidence of repayment behavior changes due to CARD. Results are robust to controlling for selection into credit card ownership and to a variety of time controls and subsample periods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mislearning and (poor) performance of individual investors
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - We study individuals' incentives to make investment decisions. Using data from a large pension system in Chile we find that individuals who are active in managing their investments have, on average, poor performance. We provide robust evidence suggesting that learning plays an important part in this phenomenon. Indeed, individuals who have made successful investment decisions in the past go on to trade more frequently. However, this result holds when using a naive definition for successful decisions. Also, average performance is negatively related to the number of investment decisions, casting doubt on the existence of market timing skills.

TI  - Preferences for deferred annuities in the Japanese retirement market
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMIC POLICY
AB  - Purpose
   Deferred annuities, which offer longevity insurance with relatively low premiums, are a potential payout option in defined contribution (DC) pension plans in Japan. This study aims to measure individual preferences for these annuities.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study conducts stated choice experiments using an original internet survey. This methodology provides a decision-making scenario similar to that faced by individuals when making real retirement saving decisions. Subjective valuations of deferred, immediate and term annuities are compared.
   Findings
   This study finds that male individuals have an insignificant preference for deferred annuities - the benefits of which begin at an advanced age. On average, deferred annuities are considered a gamble, betting against life and individuals who are married and have higher financial assets tend to value them less.
   Originality/value
   While previous studies, based on theory and simulations, have found that deferred annuities should be included in individual retirement assets, this study examines annuity preferences from the demand side (i.e. DC plan participants) -an approach that has not been addressed in the literature.

TI  - Microfinance in a developed welfare state: A hybrid technology for the government of the outcast
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - Although microfinance is often thought of as a tool to address poverty in developing countries, it is also being introduced in a number of countries in the developed world. The paper presents a qualitative study of the first year of the introduction of microfinance to address vulnerable groups in Sweden. Savings banks and nonprofit organisations collaborated in the introduction of microfinance as microcredit for micro-enterprise. The paper argues that the rationalities behind actors' participation in microfinance differed, with banks adopting a market rationality and nonprofits mainly a rationality of community empowerment. In line with a governmentality approach, the paper argues that the neoliberal market rationality dominating microcredit for micro-enterprise colonises the space of the communitarian aspect by turning the social into the personal. The paper's qualitative approach complements a governmentality analysis by highlighting the everyday resistance to the neoliberal financialisation of inclusion efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The concept of cultural branding based on various narratives has been established in the marketing literature, but there is a lack of studies linking this concept with brand-related effects. The aim of this paper is to explore and explain the possible relationships between various brand narratives based on the changing meaning of retirement and brand associations.
   Design/methodology/approach: An experimental design was used to test the proposed conceptual model and examine the impact of brand narrative on brand associations. Data were collected using an online survey from a random group of 432 respondents and analyzed using MANOVA.
   Findings: Our research did not confirm that in the case of financial products, brand narratives represented by distinctive retirement cultural codes had an impact on brand associations. Partial relation was found only for brand personality.
   Originality: This is the first study that explores brand narratives' based on cultural codes relations with brand associations.

TI  - Moment Risks: Investment for Self and for a Firm
T2  - DECISION ANALYSIS
AB  - Extreme risk taking by agents has been the subject of intense scrutiny since the 2007 financial crisis. Many have alleged that investing for a firm led to preferences for more risk taking. To test this claim, we submitted a questionnaire to a sample of 715 business school students, testing for investment preferences when investing for self and for a firm over the first four moments of the distribution of returns. We find evidence of standard deviation aversion, skewness seeking, and kurtosis seeking when investing for self. The overall kurtosis seeking of our sample as a whole is mainly driven by standard deviation lovers, skewness seekers, and males. When investing for a firm, we do not see more risk taking but rather a shift toward neutrality of preferences for standard deviation and kurtosis, which is congruent with the risk-as-feelings hypothesis. Our study also underlines the impact of financial expertise in the reduction of risk taking, both when investing for self and for the firm.

TI  - Forethought and intelligence: How conscientiousness, future planning, and general mental ability predict net worth
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
AB  - This study examined a model in which conscientiousness is related to net worth through its relationship with future planning, and in which general mental ability (GMA) moderates the effects of future planning on net worth. Data for this study were drawn from 1,135 participants in the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States. Results from an analysis of conditional indirect effects suggest that conscientiousness shared a positive, indirect association with net worth through its relationship with future planning that was realized only for individuals higher in GMA. In contrast, conscientiousness had no indirect association with net worth for those low in GMA. This study helps add to the understanding of how noncognitive (personality) and cognitive (ability) traits affect individual-level economic outcomes and offers an explanation for both how and when conscientiousness influences net worth. These findings may be particularly important given efforts to design interventions that help improve individual financial outcomes.

TI  - Insurance Literacy and Spatial Diffusion in the Life Insurance Market: A Subnational Approach in Romania
T2  - EASTERN EUROPEAN ECONOMICS
AB  - In most Eastern European countries, the life insurance market is poorly developed with respect to the income level of their citizens. Most of the academic literature investigating the determinants of this market focuses on cross-country- or individual-level studies. Our research assesses the specificities of the life insurance market at a subnational level, more specifically at the county level. The behavioral mechanisms are highlighted through cross-section linear regressions with spatial interactions on a database of 42 counties in Romania in 2015. One important result is the positive effect of insurance literacy, estimated in a national survey, on the demand for life insurance. Another significant result is the spatial diffusion process identified in life insurance density between neighboring counties. Among the control variables, we identified a significant positive impact of income and urbanization on the demand for life insurance and a negative impact of the unemployment rate.

T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - A vast digital ecosystem of entrepreneurship and exchange has sprung up with Bitcoin's digital infrastructure at its core. We explore the worldwide spread of infrastructure necessary to maintain and grow Bitcoin as a system (Bitcoin nodes) and infrastructure enabling the use of bitcoins for everyday economic transactions (Bitcoin merchants). Specifically, we investigate the role of legal, criminal, financial, and social determinants of the adoption of Bitcoin infrastructure. We offer some support for the view that the adoption of cryptocurrency infrastructure is driven by perceived failings of traditional financial systems, in that the spread of Bitcoin infrastructure is associated with low trust in banks and the financial system among inhabitants of a region, and with the occurrence of country-level inflation crises. On the other hand, our findings also suggest that active support for Bitcoin is higher in locations with well-developed banking services. Finally, we find support for the view that bitcoin adoption is also partly driven by cryptocurrencies' usefulness in engaging in illicit trade.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP & SMALL BUSINESS
AB  - Is enhanced income-generating ability due to microfinance participation has any impact on women empowerment? The current research explores riposte to the perennial research questions associated with social impact and gender disparity. More specifically, the researchers have tried to estimate the impact of microfinance participation on strategic gender need (SGN) decision-making. The researcher has collected information on different aspects of SGN and the socio-economic condition of 660 microfinance beneficiaries spread over four districts through a well-structured schedule. Rapid rural appraisal (RRA) technique was used to understand the working of self-help groups (SHGs) and the beneficiary's role in business and household activity. A probit model was used to estimate the impact of microfinance on SGN decision-making. Out of nine variables of SGN decision-making, microfinance participation, significantly impacts control over own income and creation of business assets. Microcredit participation has minimised the influence of patriarchal society and empowered women to take strategic decision independently. The impact assessment studies in microfinance were primarily focused on economic and social empowerment. Little reviews were found on the minimisation of gender inequalities. The current research is innovative in measuring the impact of microfinance on gender disparity minimisation.

TI  - Developing an agricultural entrepreneur inclination model for sustainable agriculture by integrating expert mining and ISM-MICMAC
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agribusiness is undergoing a global transition from ordinary cultivation to an agro-industrial sector. Agripreneurship is a new way of transforming agriculture into an enterprise in current business practices. This paper is written in the context of India, where many efforts have been made to encourage sustainable economic growth and development over the past decades. However, no significant progress has been seen in the agri-industry. The Indian agricultural sector is also afflicted with several other challenges related to the globalized economy, natural resource degradation, widespread rural poverty, and increasing competitiveness. In this study, we have endeavored to create an agripreneur inclination model in the context of the Indian rural sector. The objective of this study is to identify programs and policies that effectively support the development of agripreneurs. We also attempt to identify the characteristics of individuals who are more likely to become agripreneurs. The methodology we have used is based on the ISM-MICMAC technique. The findings show that agripreneur courses, agricultural policies, training and development modules, government cooperation, and the involvement of institutional heads play an essential role in inspiring the younger generation toward agripreneurship. This study's findings will help policy makers design effective policies to motivate the younger generation to consider the agricultural sector as a career option.

TI  - Affective and cognitive factors that hinder the banking relationships of economically vulnerable consumers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The aim of this paper is to explore the affective and cognitive factors that condition banking relationships for economically vulnerable consumers and how these factors contribute to increasing financial difficulties and exclusion. This research, performed on a set of focus groups, bases its findings on a combination of experimental and discourse analysis methods. Design/methodology/approach Financial decisions are not rational and can be biased by affective and cognitive factors. Behavioural finance has focused very little on analysing how consumer biases influence relationships with banking institutions. Additionally, these relationships are affected by the digitalization and transformation of banking business. Thus, in the case of economically vulnerable consumers, who are not profitable for the increasingly competitive banking industry and lack financial abilities, their risk of financial exclusion is increasing. Findings The results show that distrust and shame lead to financial difficulties in economically vulnerable consumers. Distrust generates problems of access and self-exclusion, while shame generates difficulties of use. This lack of trust makes them more rational when dealing with machines than with people, showing greater banking difficulties for consumers with a "person-suspicious" profile. Originality/value This finding can help regulators establish limits on banking behaviour, require banks to incorporate affective and cognitive factors in their convenience tests and detect new variables that can help them improve their insolvency ratios and reputations.

TI  - Use of social networks in stock investment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose Drawing on the literature regarding the social network and stock investment, this paper aims to focus on the use of the social network on stock ownership decisions at individual levels. This paper also attempts to shed light on potential mediators of the relationship between the social network and stock ownership. Design/methodology/approach To determine the relationship between stock ownership and using the social network, logistic regression was used. In order to isolate the effect of using hs on stock ownership, a decomposing method was adopted. Findings The findings provide evidence of the positive contribution of the use of social networks in stock ownership. Personal characteristics, such as household net worth, homeownership, education level and risk tolerance, may play a vital role in influencing individuals' decisions regarding stock investment. In addition, this study contributes to our understanding of income's mediating role in stock investment decisions. Originality/value First, the authors contribute theoretically by drawing from the assumptions of social networking contagion theory, social influence theory, and social capital theory. Second, we explored potential mediators of the relationship between the social network and stock ownership. Third, this study complements the literature in incorporating the social network in business, financial professionals to be exact.

TI  - Retail investors' trading and stock market liquidity
T2  - NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB  - The paper investigates the relation between retail investors' participation in trading and aggregate stock market liquidity. The findings show a positive and significant relation between retail investors' trading and stock market liquidity. Examination of the determinants of retail investors' trading reveals that, on average, retail investors with more diversified trading activity tend to trade when liquidity is higher, the frequency of their arrival to the market is not affected by the level of liquidity, and retail investors are willing to trade at a lower liquidity level as sellers than as buyers. Moreover, retail investors' trading does not create price noise at the aggregate market level. Overall, the evidence suggests that retail investors contribute to market quality.

TI  - Till mortgage do us part: Mortgage switching costs and household's bank switching
T2  - JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE
AB  - We investigate the role of mortgage switching costs in shaping the households' decision to change their main bank. To this end, we use a unique panel dataset that enables us to infer household's bank switching, in conjunction with a legal reform that exogenously slashed down the mortgage switching costs. The empirical evidence, which survives to a variety of robustness checks, supports the hypothesis that the explicit switching costs in the retail banking market are a weighty factor in shaping households' bank switching, despite any potential "informational lock-in". Dissecting the results, we show that the effects of the reform were not uniform across households. The more educated households, those with a longer or broader relationship with their previous bank and those residing in ex-ante less competitive banking markets were at the forefront of the wave of bank switching.

TI  - Time is money: Rational life cycle inertia and the delegation of investment management
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Many households display inertia in investment management over their life cycles. Our calibrated dynamic life cycle portfolio choice model can account for such an apparently 'irrational' outcome, by incorporating the fact that investors must forgo acquiring job-specific skills when they spend time managing their money, and their efficiency in financial decision making varies with age. Resulting inertia patterns mesh well with findings from prior studies and our own empirical results from Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data. We also analyze how people optimally choose between actively managing their assets versus delegating the task to financial advisors. Delegation proves valuable to both the young and the old. Our calibrated model quantifies welfare gains from including investment time and money costs as well as delegation in a life cycle setting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - PROTOCOL: Effects of interventions to improve access to financial services for micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises in low- and middle-income countries: An evidence and gap map
T2  - CAMPBELL SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS
AB  - BackgroundMicro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) account for the vast majority of firms in most economies, particularly in developing nations, and are key contributors to job creation and global economic development. However, the most significant impediment to MSME development in low- and middle-income countries is a lack of access to both investment and working capital financing. Due to a lack of essential track record, appropriate collateral, and credit history, MSMEs are frequently denied business loans by traditional lending institutions. In addition, SMEs' inability to access funding is hindered by institutional, structural, and non-financial factors. To address this, both the public and private sectors employ indirect and direct finance interventions to help MSMEs in developing and emerging economies enhance and increase their financing needs. Given the importance of MSMEs in the economy, a comprehensive overview of and systematic synthesizing of the evidence of the effects of financial access interventions for MSMEs, capturing a wide variety of outcome variables, is useful. ObjectivesThe objective of this evidence and gap map (EGM) is to describe the existing evidence on the effects of various interventions dedicated to supporting and improving MSMEs' access to credit, as well as the corresponding firm performance and/or welfare outcomes. MethodsAn EGM is a systematic evidence product that displays the existing evidence relevant to a specific research question. An EGM's end product is a research article or report, but it can also be shared via an interactive map drawn as a matrix of included studies and their corresponding interventions and outcomes. Interventions in low- and middle-income countries that target specific population subgroups are included on the map. The EGM considers five types of interventions: (i) strategy, legislation and regulatory; (ii) systems and institutions; (iii) facilitate access; (iv) lending instruments or financial products; and (v) demand-side interventions. The map, on the other hand, covers outcome domains for policy environment, financial inclusion, firm performance, and welfare. Impact evaluations or systematic reviews of relevant interventions for a previously defined target population are included in the EGM. Studies using experimental or non-experimental designs, as well as systematic reviews, are eligible. The EGM excludes before-and-after study designs with no suitable comparison group. Furthermore, the map excludes literature reviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and descriptive analyses. Search strings were used to conduct electronic searches in databases. To ensure that the research team had identified a significant portion of relevant research works, the search strategy was supplemented with gray literature searches and systematic review citation tracking. We have compiled studies that are either completed or in progress. For practical reasons, studies are limited to papers written in English and are not restricted by publication date. Selection CriteriaWe included studies that examined interventions to enhance MSMEs' access to finance in low- and middle-income countries targeting MSMEs including households, smallholder farmers and single person enterprise as well as financial institutions/agencies and their staff.
   The EGM considers five types of interventions that aim to: (i) deliver strategy, legislation, and regulatory aspects; (ii) systems and institutions that enable financing; (iii) facilitate access to finance; (iv) deliver different lending instruments or financial products, including traditional forms of microcredit; and (v) demand-side interventions such as programs on financial literacy. The map includes outcome domains surrounding policy environment, financial inclusion, firm performance, and welfare. Eligible studies must be experimental, non-experimental, or systematic reviews. In addition, the study designs must have a suitable comparison group before and after the implementation of interventions. ResultsThe EGM includes 413 studies. The majority of the studies (379 studies) analyzed microenterprises, such as households and smallholder farmers; 7 studies analyzed community groups; while 109 studies analyzed small and medium enterprises. There were 147 studies on interventions that targeted multiple firm sizes. Lending instruments/financial products are the most common intervention across all firm types. When it comes to the types of firms that receive the said financial intervention, the data is overwhelmingly in favor of microenterprises (278 studies), followed by systems and organizations (138 studies) that support better access to such financial products and services. Welfare outcomes have the most evidence out of all of the outcomes of interest, followed by firm performance and financial inclusion. Among all firm types, welfare outcomes are primarily targeted at microenterprises. With 59 studies, we can say that small businesses have a significantly large number of enterprise performance outcomes. of the 413 studies, 243 used non-experimental or quasi-experimental designs (mainly propensity score matching and instrumental variable approaches), 136 used experimental methods, and 34 were systematic reviews. 175 studies (43%) provided evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa, 142 studies (35%) from South Asia, 86 studies (21%) from East Asia and the Pacific, 66 studies (16%) from Latin America and the Caribbean, 28 studies (7%), Europe and Central Asia, and 21 studies (5%) from the Middle East and North Africa. Most of the included evidence covers low-income (26%) and lower-middle income countries (66%), and to a lesser extent upper-middle-income countries (26%). ConclusionThis map depicts the existing evidence and gaps on the effects of interventions to enhance MSMEs' access to financial services in low and middle-income countries. Interventions directed at microenterprises with welfare outcomes have a significant number of research outcomes in the literature. SME evaluations have looked at firm performance, with less focus to employment and the welfare effects on owners and employees, including poverty reduction. Microcredit/loans have been the focus of a large number of research papers (238 studies), indicating the field's growing popularity. However, emerging financial interventions such as facilitating access to digital financial services are relatively under-studied. Several studies also investigate rural or population in remote areas with 192 studies, 126 studies on poor and disadvantaged, and 114 papers on women. Most of the research is conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa (175 studies) and South Asia (142 studies) so further research in other regions could be conducted to allow a more holistic understanding of the effects of financial inclusion interventions.
   Credit lines, supply chain finance, and trade financing, which are some of the ADB's financial tools have limited evidence. Future studies should look into strategy, law, and regulation interventions, as well as interventions targeted at SMEs, and examine policy and regulatory environment outcomes as well as welfare outcomes. Interventions on the demand side and their impact on the policy and regulatory environment, as well as facilitating access are relatively understudied.

TI  - Reducing Strategic Forbearance under the CARES Act: an Experimental Approach Utilizing Recourse Attestation
T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was passed in response to both the global pandemic's immediate negative and expected long-lasting impacts on the economy. Under the Act, mortgage borrowers are allowed to cease making payments if their income was negatively impacted by Covid-19. Importantly, borrowers were not required to demonstrate proof of impaction, either currently or retrospectively. Exploring the economic implications of this policy, this study uses an experimental design to first identify strategic forbearance incidence, and then to quantify where the forborne mortgage payment dollars were spent. Our results suggest strategic mortgage forbearance can be significantly reduced, saving taxpayers billions of dollars in potential losses, simply by requiring a 1-page attestation with lender recourse for borrowers wishing to engage in COVID-19 related mortgage payment cessation programs. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of these forborne mortgage payments range from enhancing the financial safety net for distressed borrowers by increasing precautionary savings, to buying necessities, to equity investing and debt consolidation.

TI  - How gender, marital status, and gender norms affect savings goals
T2  - KYKLOS
AB  - Setting savings goals can increase wealth accumulation behaviour, yet it depends on how challenging the goals are. Using rarely available savings goal data from 1,760 clients of an advisory investment firm, we identify gender attitudinal differences in goal amounts: men choose more ambitious savings goals than women, independently from expected life-long earnings. This, however, holds only for individuals living in a couple, for which men's savings goals reach the highest levels. Based on insights from qualitative research (56 semi-structured interviews of 60 participants), we argue that these differences originate from gender-normative roles assigned to members within the households. Most women are assigned to daily budget management, exacerbating worries about financial security issues in the short term and negatively impacting savings goals. This observation holds even when women, rather than men, manage long-term investment for the household. Men's assignment to long-term financial planning is related to optimism and ambition with regards to their savings goal choice, but these attitudes remain conditional on the fact that they do not deal with day-to-day budget management.

TI  - Partial recall: differences between actual and self-reported annuitization decisions in Sweden
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This paper reports the results from a large telephone survey of 1,000 retiring white-collar workers in Sweden. Shortly before the interview, the participants at age 65 had a choice of receiving a life annuity by default or opting for a fixed-term payout, with a minimum payout length of 5 years. Large monetary amounts were at stake in the payout decision of the survey participants; the average monthly pension payment under the life annuity amounted to US $280. Comparing the survey responses with administrative records on actual payout choices, I find that a majority of retiring white-collar workers fail to recall their payout decision. The recollection rate is much lower among annuitants (those who chose the default option); only 40% of the annuitants accurately recalled their payout decision compared to 77% of those who opted for a fixed-term payout. Beyond payout choice, few individual characteristics predict successful recollection.

TI  - Does reinvesting payouts in plain vanilla exchange-traded funds enhance household portfolio performance?
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
AB  - A frequent recommendation to households is to invest in XTFs, ie, plain vanilla exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that replicate broad, internationally diversified market indexes. However, many households own financial assets already and are not able or willing to sell them for a switch to XTFs. This paper is, to the best of the author's knowledge, the first to examine, as an alternative for such households, whether reinvesting payouts in XTFs enhances households' portfolio performance (after transaction costs). Risk and return of household portfolios are estimated using representative security holding data of German households from January 2014 to June 2017. Thereby, multiple asset classes of household portfolios and several types of transaction costs are considered. The results indicate that reinvesting payouts in XTFs on average enhances households' portfolio performance after transaction costs and that this strategy is more favorable and cost-efficient than reinvesting payouts according to households' current portfolio composition. To obtain economically significant enhancements, however, a longer period than the three-and-a-half-year observation period is necessary. The findings suggest that reinvesting payouts in XTFs is a useful alternative strategy for households who invest for the long term, who already hold financial assets and want to switch to XTFs but are unable or unwilling to sell their current assets.

TI  - We Learn Not for School but for Life: Empirical Evidence of the Impact of Tax Literacy on Tax Compliance
T2  - EASTERN EUROPEAN ECONOMICS
AB  - Tax revenues are fundamental budgetary resources for the majority of governments around the world. Consequently, the goal of identifying efficient strategies that facilitate an increase in tax compliance should be on the agenda of all tax authorities. By surveying 358 Romanian taxpayers, our study analyzes how tax literacy influences tax compliance, thus contributing to the existing literature, which reports few results on this topic. Using moderation analysis, we find that tax literacy is one of the key elements shaping tax compliance. Respondents who reported more neutral social representations of taxation concepts turned out to be more tax literate and more willing to comply voluntarily. The level of tax literacy was estimated using a tax literacy index created for this purpose. Our study provides policy makers with a starting point for understanding how taxpayers comprehend taxation concepts and how they relate to the tax system. Equipped with such information, those charged with designing tax policy could help raise literacy among taxpayers, making the role of tax collection more salient and ultimately improving tax compliance.

TI  - Are retail investors less aggressive on small price stocks?
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - We investigate whether number processing impacts the limit order aggressiveness of retail investors. When posting non-marketable orders, individual investors are less aggressive on small price stocks than on large price stocks. This difference is not explained by differences in liquidity and other usual drivers of order aggressiveness. No such difference exists for limit orders of high-frequency traders. The small price bias is detrimental to retail investors since it increases the costs borne when trading small price stocks.

TI  - iBuyer's Use of PropTech to Make Large-Scale Cash Offers
T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE RESEARCH
AB  - The expansion of iBuyer's use of PropTech to major housing markets raises a series of questions for both buyers and sellers when making instant, all-cash offers. This study uses a sequence of experiments to identify the proper implementation of existing behavioral real estate concepts to improve the iBuying process, a burgeoning area of residential real estate. We find strong evidence of anchoring for all-cash offers in that sellers are nearly twice as likely to transact when they are first presented with the net proceeds offer price (market value minus costs) rather than starting with the higher gross market value offer price. After the sale, seller regret aversion becomes strong when the seller's house is subsequently sold for 10% or more than the all-cash buyer paid, but regret aversion is mitigated with communication of the improvements made to enhance the selling price. We further find that sellers do not know which all-cash buyer's Automated Valuation Model (AVM) is the most accurate and are therefore much more influenced by brand awareness than model sophistication. Finally, while the extant literature has examined offer price strategies for home sellers, this is the first investigation of buyer offer price strategies. In stark contrast to selling strategies, pricing strategies do not matter when making an offer to buy.

TI  - Multivariate stochastic volatility for herding detection: Evidence from the energy sector
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - The paper proposes a multivariate asymmetric stochastic volatility approach, allowing for common factors that detect and measure herding behavior conditional on the stylized facts of asset returns and another factor that captures non-herding behavior. Applying our approach to the constituents of the S & P 500 energy sector in periods of high uncertainty, the findings reveal a wealth of information on herding detection related to asset returns' co-movements and volatility encountered by the energy sector. We also examine to what degree macroeconomic indicators' uncertainty influences the common factors on herding detection. We conclude that stylized facts of energy assets experience significant changes, arising from the increased systemic market risk and crude oil prices that are exposed to.

T2  - WORK AGING AND RETIREMENT
AB  - Retirement planning is a widely promoted activity to enhance wellbeing for aging populations. However, there is limited follow-up data to understand the antecedents of multi-dimensional retirement planning activities, the resources such activities produce or the explanatory mechanisms. This research draws on recent theorizing, which suggests that retirement planning may play a mediating role in explaining how pre-retirement antecedents are transformed into retirement resources. Antecedents, planning and retirement resources were examined using 3 waves of follow-up data collected in 2006, 2008, and 2014. Four hundred thirty-five people originally employed in 2008 and retired by 2014 participated in the study. Health, income, and a positive retirement attitude (T1) were the strongest predictors of retirement planning (T2), but job satisfaction and occupation also played smaller predictive roles. Financial planning (T2) predicted health, psychosocial, and financial resources in retirement (T3). However, health, lifestyle, and psychosocial planning played a minimal role in explaining retirement resources, and only financial planning demonstrated noteworthy evidence of mediation. Findings can help to inform policy decisions by identifying those at greatest risk of not planning, and to isolate the factors most likely to explain the longer-term effects of planning. Understanding which resources are predicted by different domains of planning will also help inform the targeting of interventions.

TI  - Marketplace lending of small- and medium-sized enterprises
T2  - STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL
AB  - Research Summary When evaluating Internet-based loan project of small and medium size enterprises (SME), lenders can rely on easy-to-understand risk ratings or more sophisticated financial information. We investigate lenders decisions and its effect on loan funding success on the marketplace-lending platform Zencap. The data set has been provided by the platform Zencap and includes 414 SME marketplace loans and 2,196 lenders. The data examined provide strong support for the importance of simple platform ratings in influencing investor behavior, while the effect of more detailed financial information is less pronounced, controlling for relevant variables. Higher interest rates appear more profitable to investors without any serious concern about non-repayment. Managerial Summary Platform managers and potential borrowers are interested in how to encourage lenders to pledge their money on marketplace-lending platforms. We investigate the influence of easy-to-understand risk ratings and more sophisticated financial information on investment decisions and their effect on loan funding success on the marketplace-lending platform Zencap. We investigate 414 SME marketplace loans and 2,196 lenders. We find that for marketplace lending on Zencap the effect of more detailed financial information is less pronounced than easy-to-understand risk ratings. Platforms base risk ratings on information other than the entrepreneurs' financial information.

TI  - Impact of goodwill on capital structure and the moderating role of investors' education
T2  - MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper investigates the impact of goodwill on capital structure and how investors' education affects the relationship between goodwill and capital structure in developing and developed countries. This study covers both developing and developed countries using a sample of 4912 and 4303 non-financial companies from 23 developing and 9 developed countries, respectively, over 9 years (2010-2018). By applying panel data techniques, study shows that goodwill has a significant positive impact on the capital structure of developing and developed countries. Besides, investors' education moderates the relationship between goodwill and capital structure, especially in developed countries. Managers of the goodwill assets-based companies in developing and developed countries can formulate their borrowing policy in the same fashion as the managers of a tangible asset-based company do. Outcomes of this study will help investors/creditors in those countries to develop a clear view of the collateralization of goodwill. Policymakers in the developed countries will have a better idea about the role of investors' education in the financing of the companies.

TI  - Simplifying Complex Disclosures: Evidence from Disclosure Regulation in the Mortgage Markets
T2  - ACCOUNTING REVIEW
AB  - Complex disclosures have long been a major source of borrowers' poor understanding of mortgages. We examine the effect of simplifying mortgage disclosures in a difference-in-differences design around a significant disclosure rule mandated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2015. We find that inexperienced borrowers (first-time home buyers) pay significantly lower interest rates after the disclosure regulation than experienced borrowers (repeat buyers), suggesting that simplifying these disclosures reduces mortgage interest costs. Additional tests show that the reduction in interest costs is not accompanied with more upfront noninterest costs paid by borrowers. Our cross-sectional analyses reveal two mechanisms through which simplifying disclosures lowers interest costs: curbing predatory lending and facilitating borrower shopping. We further find that disadvantaged borrowers (Black, Hispanic, and single female) benefit more from simplified disclosures. Last, we do not find that simplifying disclosures affects mortgage loan performance. JEL Classifications: G21; G5; G18; M4.

TI  - Impact of gamification on mitigating behavioral biases of investors
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - We investigate whether gamification can help mitigate behavioral biases of investors by conducting a unique stock market experiment that is free from observer-expectancy and subject-expectancy effects. Utilizing the trading data of investors who simultaneously have active portfolios in an investment firm and stock market simulation game, we show that investors have different biases in real versus simulated settings. We find that participating in a stock market game affects all biases differently, with different degrees of participation to the game. While overconfidence bias and disposition effect can be mitigated and decrease with more active participation in the game, familiarity and status quo biases increase. We also show that young, inexperienced investors with average-sized portfolios and men are more likely to participate. These findings will especially be of interest to researchers, financial institutions and governmental bodies that plan to conduct similar experiments and design services promoting better financial decision-making and investment behavior.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Numeracy and wealth
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Numeracy is defined as the ability to understand and use numerical information. We examined the relationship between numeracy and wealth using a cross-sectional and a longitudinal study. For a sample of approximately 1000 Dutch adults, we found a statistically significant correlation between numeracy and wealth, even after controlling for differences in education, risk preferences, beliefs about future income, financial knowledge, need for cognition or seeking financial advice. Conditional on socio-demographic characteristics, our estimates suggest that on average a one-point increase in the numeracy score (11-point scale) of the respondent is associated with 5 percent more personal wealth. Additionally, we find that numeracy is a key determinant of the wealth accumulation trajectories that people follow over time. Over a 5-year period, while participants with low numeracy decumulate wealth, participants with high numeracy maintain a constant positive level of wealth. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Annuity selection in the presence of insurer default risk and government guarantees
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND INSURANCE
AB  - We investigate whether individuals correctly assess the risk of default of annuity providers and incorporate this information into their decision-making when purchasing an annuity. To do so, we analyze actual retirement product choices from a large administrative data set from Chile and exploit an exogenous change that decreased the coverage of government guarantees against annuity provider default. If individuals are rational and properly incorporate default risk into their decision process then, before this change, individuals should choose riskier providers that give higher annuity payments. However, we find that individuals' decisions are not influenced by changes in their protection against the risk of provider default. It seems that individuals have been unnecessarily reducing their annuity payments by not incorporating crucial information about their actual risk exposure to default when selecting annuities at retirement.

TI  - Borrow to be the poor or the rich? It depends: Credit market and wealth accumulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - We investigate the relationship between access to credit and wealth accumulation to understand the rising wealth inequality. Empirical results suggest an asymmetric heterogeneity over the whole range of wealth distribution. There is a significantly negative relationship between house-hold debt and wealth accumulation for poor households but a significantly positive relationship for wealthy households. Wealthy households could better benefit from the investment debt, but poor households fail. We discuss the two channels of entrepreneurship and investment behaviors. This paper contributes to the literature on wealth distribution by mapping the relationships between the credit market and household wealth accumulation.

TI  - The underlying motivational process behind portfolio diversification choice decisions of individual investors: An experimental design
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - The present study explores the underlying motivational process and their boundary conditions behind portfolio (asset class) diversification choice decisions through the lenses of 'regulatory focus' and 'regulatory fit' theories. The study specifically focuses on how such choice decisions differ across chronic (trait) and situational (state) goal-orientation conditions. We use an experimental research design with a survey-based sample of 586 respondents and a two-way ANOVA test for analyzing data collected in two phases. Our principal findings are as follows: (i) investors with chronic promotion (prevention) conditions adopt wider (narrower) portfolio choices; (ii) in convergent promotion (prevention) conditions, they espouse wider (narrower) portfolio choices as compared to the chronic conditions; and (iii) in convergent promotion (prevention) conditions, they prefer wider (narrower) choices than in the divergent conditions. We support our findings by a detailed discussion along with the theoretical and managerial implications. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Retirement timing uncertainty: Empirical evidence and quantitative evaluation
T2  - REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS
AB  - People often retire at a different age than expected. We construct a measure of retirement timing uncertainty and find that the standard deviation of the difference between retire-ment expectations and actual retirement dates ranges from 3 to 6 years. To understand the potential implications of this uncertainty, we develop a simple model of exogenous but risky retirement. In this environment, individuals would give up 1.0%-4.5% of total life-time consumption to fully insure this risk and 0.8%-3.2% of lifetime consumption simply to know their actual retirement date upon entering the labor force. This is crucial for re-tirement planning purposes because not saving to hedge this risk would leave individuals with even larger welfare costs.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - COVID-19 and overconfidence bias: the case of developed, emerging and frontier markets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS
AB  - Purpose The main purpose of the present study is to delve into the overconfidence bias in global stock markets during both pre COVID-19 and COVID-19 phases. Design/methodology/approach The present study makes use of daily adjusted closing prices and volume of the broad market indices of 46 global stock markets over a period ranging from July 2015 till June 2020. The sample period is split into pre COVID-19 and COVID-19 phases. In order to test the overconfidence fallacy in the chosen stock markets, bivariate market-wide vector auto regression (VAR) models and impulse response functions (IRFs) have been employed in both phases. Findings A highly significant contemporaneous relationship between market return and volume appears to be more pronounced in the Japanese, US, Chinese and Vietnamese stock markets in the pre COVID-19 era for the relevant coefficients are positive and highly significant for most lags. Coming to the period of turbulence, the present study discovers strong overconfident behavior in the Chinese, Taiwanese, Turkish, Jordanian and Vietnamese stock markets during COVID-19 phase. Practical implications A stark finding is that none of the developed stock markets reveal strong overconfidence bias during pandemic, suggesting a loss or decline in the investors' confidence. Therefore, the regulators should try to regain the investors' trust and confidence in the markets by ensuring honest, fair and transparent practices. The money managers should reduce the transaction cost to encourage trading and educate investors to hold a well-diversified portfolio to mitigate risk in the long run. The governments may launch recovery packages focusing on sustaining and improving economic activities. Finally, a better investment culture may be built by the corporate houses through good corporate governance practices to regain lost trust. Originality/value The present study appears to be the very first attempt to gauge overconfidence bias in the wake of a recent COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Social Capital, Trusting, and Trustworthiness: Evidence from Peer-to-Peer Lending
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
AB  - How does social capital affect trust? Evidence from a Chinese peer-to-peer lending platform shows that regional social capital affects the trustee's trustworthiness and the trustor's trust propensity. Ceteris paribus, borrowers from regions with higher social capital receive larger bids from individual lenders and have higher funding success, larger loan sizes, and lower default rates, especially for low-quality borrowers. Lenders from regions with higher social capital take higher risks and have higher default rates, especially for inexperienced lenders. Cross-regional transactions are most (least) likely to be realized between parties from regions with high (low) social capital.

TI  - Development of Local Economy through the Strengthening of Small-Medium-Sized Forest Enterprises in KPK, Pakistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Small-medium-sized forest enterprises (SMFEs) have historically played an essential role in developing countries' economies worldwide because most businesses start as small businesses, and government support and knowledge-based recourse are critical to the sustainable development of SMFEs and local economies. The current studies examined the effects of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) government's (Pakistan) support (GS) and entrepreneur knowledge (EK) on the development of small-medium-sized forest enterprises (SD) and their contribution to the local economic development (LED) of the region. Primary data were collected from 350 SMFEs in KPK, Pakistan. The model was developed by using a structural equation model (SEM) to investigate the impact of GS, EK, and SMFEs on the growth, SG, and sustainable development of the local economy. This study concludes that EK and GS could increase growth in SMFE businesses and contribute to LED. On the other hand, crediting loans and equipping businesses with training could not directly affect SMFE businesses and LED growth. The government needs to use natural resources and the SMFE communities as leaders among suppliers in the local market for the sustainable development of LED and SMFEs, alongside focusing on preserving and taking initiatives to develop. This study discusses several practical implications for policymakers, business owners, and academics, with recommendations for future research.

AB  - The paper examines the influence of informative signals derived from exogenous factors on herding intensity in the cryptocurrency market. We propose a novel approach whereby extracted signals are endogenized in investors' decision-making. The signals may induce investors to converge towards (depart from) the market consensus, contributing to herding amplification (dampening). The findings reveal substantial asymmetries with respect to the intensity of herding stemming from exogenous influences. We conclude that the evidenced diversity is indicative of the value that investors attach to the information embedded in the different external signals they receive. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Life insurance misselling and the influences of client attributes: evidence from China
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB  - Prior studies have extensively explored factors that drive misselling behavior in life insurance markets, but considered little the influences of attributes of clients (particularly vulnerable clients) on unethical sales. Our study that is based on the neoclassical theory of the firm aims to investigate the relationships between attributes of life insurance clients and unethical selling behavior of salespeople. Applying logit and probit models to a sample of 35,075 observations from a Chinese life insurance company, our study finds that salespeople are more likely to perform unethical selling to ill-educated clients. Further, when salespeople's sex and education are considered, the result shows that male or poorly-educated salespeople are more likely to make unethical selling. These findings enrich the literature of misselling of life insurance and offer some practical implications for both insurers and regulators to manage life insurance markets and control misselling behaviors.

TI  - Schooling, numeracy, and wealth accumulation: A study involving an agrarian population
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Accumulating wealth is one of the main concerns for consumers. Higher education is widely associated with higher wealth, but the underlying reasons for this association remain unclear. Using data from a field study conducted with 218 adults in agrarian communities in Peru's Andean highlands, we explored the extent to which education, non-numeric fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, and numeracy skills were related to wealth. Wealth was measured using data on asset ownership (e.g., owning a fridge) and housing characteristics (e.g., toilet facilities). Structural equation modeling revealed that the level of schooling was associated with greater numeracy as well as greater non-numeric fluid and crystallized intelligence; only greater numeracy was associated with greater wealth. Our findings are consistent with the idea that education is linked with financial outcomes, at least in part, through the enhancement of cognitive skills, particularly numeracy that then leads to greater wealth accumulation.

TI  - Affectivity and riskiness of retirement investment decisions
T2  - PERSONNEL REVIEW
AB  - Purpose Drawing on broaden-and-build theory and promotion- and prevention-focus theory, the authors examined the role of positive and negative affectivity (PANA) on the riskiness of investment decisions. The authors also examined the mediating impact of financial knowledge network intensity (i.e. the level of communication with financially literate others in employees' social network) on the PANA-riskiness of investment decisions relationship. Design/methodology/approach Study 1 used a sample of undergraduate students and operationalized risk using a hypothetical investment scenario. Study 2 replicated and extended the Study 1 findings using employees and operationalized risk using their real-world investment allocations. Findings Both Studies 1 and 2 provided support for the negative direct relationship between NA and the riskiness of investment decisions. Study 2 found PA was marginally positively related to the riskiness of investment decisions. Financial knowledge network intensity mediated the relationship between NA and the riskiness of investment decisions in Study 2. Research limitations/implications - The findings suggest that employees who see the world in a generally negative light tended to have weaker financial knowledge networks, and this may be one mechanism that explains why they make low-risk investments. Practical implications - Financial knowledge networks can provide access to critical information regarding investment opportunities. Socialization training or social mixers can be used to help employees build and improve their financial knowledge networks. Originality/value The authors integrate the research on PANA, social networks, and investment decisions to illuminate the social network processes that explain how affectivity impacts the riskiness of retirement investment decisions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING
AB  - We use Finnish household-level data from 1994 to 2013 to measure how often and what kind of forecast errors households make and how the errors are linked to the households' borrowing behavior and overindebtedness. We find that those households that make the largest optimistic forecast errors have greater debt-to-income ratios. They also are more likely to report that they suffer from excessive debt loads and have problems in coping with their bills. There are no such systematic effects for the households that make pessimistic forecast errors.

TI  - The predictive power of exponential numeracy
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Many fundamental relationships, from the spread of disease to climate change, as well as common scales, such as the Richter, pH, and Decibel scales, are characterized by exponential relationships. Across six pre-registered studies (N = 3522) and three supplemental studies (N = 1079), we introduce and test a measure of exponential numeracy. We demonstrate that individuals with greater exponential numeracy are better able to recognize, understand, and predict exponential trends. In doing so, we make several important contributions. First, we show that exponential numeracy helps people predict consequential phenomena, such as the spread of COVID-19 and sales of a popular product after launch. Second, compared to people low in exponential numeracy, people high in exponential numeracy are less influenced by anchoring when forecasting exponential phenomena. Third, we link exponential numeracy with the ability to understand common data presentations. We demonstrate that different presentations of exponential data predictably influence forecast accuracy, but that exponential numeracy mitigates these effects. Our findings have important implications for communicating exponential trends and advance our understanding of how individuals make decisions involving exponential relationships.

TI  - Alphabeticity Bias in 401(k) Investing
T2  - FINANCIAL REVIEW
AB  - Structural factors that cause irrational investment in defined contribution savings plans are of great concern. Using a proprietary database of 401(k) plans we show that alphabeticity-the order that fund names appear when listed in alphabetical order-significantly biases participants' investment allocation decisions. While we show a larger impact as the number of funds in the plan increases, this bias is strong even when relatively few funds are available in the plan menu. Importantly, our findings suggest that a more strategic ordering of funds could result in favorable outcomes for participants.

TI  - Biases in Capital Market Instrument Investing Decisions: A Study from India
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - This study examines the influence of different behavioral biases on the investment choices made by individual investors in the Indian capital market. The study utilizes a cross-sectional design, which entails gathering a substantial amount of data at a specific point in time. The study employed a survey methodology to collect data from a sample of 497 individual investors using purposive and snowball sampling. The data was collected using structural equation modeling (SEM), utilizing SPSS version 25 and AMOS version 26 as statistical software. This study characterizes individual investors as displaying irrational conduct. The study reveals a significant and positive association between representativeness, anchoring, and loss aversion biases and the investment decision-making process of individual investors in India. This study will enhance the current corpus of literature by examining the field of behavioral finance, which is gaining acknowledgment. Furthermore, few researchers have specifically examined these biases in developing countries, such as India.

TI  - INVESTMENT GAMES
T2  - DUKE LAW JOURNAL
AB  - Popular zero-commission stock trading apps like Robinhood innovate in user-experience design, featuring "gamification" practices-flashy graphics, leaderboards, and the like-that make it attractive, easy, and fun to trade stocks. Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing gamification and other digital engagement practices, with efforts underway at the SEC to adopt rules in broker-dealer and investment-advisor regulation. This attention reflects considerable skepticism about gamification in securities markets. At best, these practices encourage motivation and engagement, and democratize access to financial markets. But at worst, these practices encourage people to trade habitually and unreflectively, and more than they might want. This can lead to undesirable market-wide effects, like distorting the process by which markets allocate investment capital to firms and projects that will grow the real economy, as well as socially wasteful (and individually harmful) excessive trading. And given that interventions in retail investor choice have significant implications for market quality and wealth inequality, regulatory responses here are a high stakes matter for society broadly. Calls to regulate gamification highlight a tension at the core of securities markets. Securities law has largely ceded the field of market structure to the interests of sophisticated financial intermediaries in producing liquidity and price discovery. By permitting gamification practices that encourage active trading for the primary benefit of financial intermediaries, securities law subordinates its investor protection function to encourage wasteful investment in achieving eversmaller improvements in liquidity and price discovery. Regulatory intervention would be socially desirable, I argue, not just given what we know about retail trader behavior and its effects on personal finance and markets-but because it is an opportunity for securities law to recalibrate away from an all-out arms race in arbitrage. This Article takes up the problem of gamification and related digital engagement practices. It considers how gamification is the nearly inevitable consequence of the rise of retail investors who trade without superior information about a stock's fundamental value, competition on brokerage commissions, and a fragmented market structure. Yet calls for regulatory interventions often elide important distinctions between how securities law should treat active traders who prefer risk, and those with preferences distorted by gamification. This Article explains how we got here; examines the social-welfare case for regulating gamification and related digital engagement practices; offers a typology of techniques that securities regulators can adopt in response; and assesses these interventions against existing securities law doctrine and policy. This Article also considers how the securities laws' tenuous relationship with innovative stock-market technology shapes how retail investors engage with financial markets.

TI  - Literacy and strategic marketing to raise public awareness using Sharia pawnshops during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to reveal empirical facts that literacy and marketing strategies effectively impact people using Sharia pawn products during the COVID-19 pandemic because of the pressure of capital needs and financial difficulties. Design/methodology/approachThis study used an exploratory qualitative research approach through semi-structured interviews with six partners of different productive ages and social, economic and educational backgrounds. After data reduction, presentation, description and validation, this paper develops the theory and presents it as a qualitative thematic analysis. FindingsThe findings of this study revealed that those who had socialised Sharia pawnshops had a low literacy level. Nonetheless, the socialisation of Sharia pawnshops increases literacy and public understanding of pawnshop products in Sharia pawnshops. This issue arises because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which makes it impossible for Sharia pawnshops to hold an event or socialise. Originality/valueThe authenticity of this study proves that literacy and marketing strategies can increase public awareness of Sharia pawn products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - From intention to decision in purchasing life insurance and private pensions: different effects of knowledge and behavioural factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB  - In this paper, we test several hypotheses about the influence of behavioural and socio-demographic factors on buying a life insurance policy or a private pension. Data were gathered from a sample of 1579 individuals, representative of Romanian consumers. We designed a questionnaire that emphasizes five distinct categories of determinants: economic factors, socio-demographic factors, general behavioural factors, specific behavioural factors, and a self-constructed index of insurance knowledge. Using logit regression models, we highlight a different mechanism that emphasizes the association between the intention and decision for life insurance and private pensions and its determinants. We show that specific behavioural factors and insurance knowledge are highly significant for the decision to buy, but not for the intention to buy, for both types of products.

TI  - Can information provision and preference elicitation promote ESG investments? Evidence from a large, incentivized online experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE
AB  - Sustainable investing is characterized by considerations of both financial returns and ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) impacts. We investigate how information about these two aspects, individually and in combination, affects investors' decision to invest sustainably and their satisfaction with the information they received. We also test whether different ESG preference elicitation modes affect these investment decisions and investors' satisfaction. We conduct an incentivized online experiment with two samples, experienced retail investors and a representative sample of the Austrian population in terms of age and gender (N = 2,254 in total). We find that both financial return information and ESG impact information stimulate ESG investment. Providing both types of information does not have a greater effect than presenting either one alone. Finally, we find no effect on satisfaction and the ESG preference elicitation mode significantly affects neither investment decisions nor satisfaction.

TI  - What's the Catch? Suspicion of Bank Motives and Sluggish Refinancing
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - Failing to refinance a mortgage can cost a borrower thousands of dollars. Based on administrative data from a large financial institution, we show that around 50% of borrowers leave thousands of dollars on the table by not refinancing. Survey data indicate that, among all the behavioral factors examined, only suspicion of banks' motives is consistently related to the probability of accepting a refinancing offer. Finally, we report the results of three field experiments showing that enticing offers made by banks fail to increase participation and may even deepen suspicion. Our findings highlight the important role of trust in financial decisions.

TI  - Choice of Retirement Funds in Chile: Are Chilean Women More Risk Averse than Men?
T2  - SEX ROLES
AB  - This study examined the investment decisions of women and men in Chile who were contributing to Chile's mandatory defined contribution (DC) retirement plan, using a large survey of participants (2782 people) conducted in 2009 by Chile's Subsecretariat of Social Protection. The basic research question was whether Chilean women were more risk averse in their retirement investment decisions than Chilean men. Chile's retirement plan offers a default plan for those who do not want to manage their funds. For those wishing to manage their investments, it offers five funds varying in risk from an all bond fund to a fund that is primarily stocks. There was no significant difference in the percentage of men and women choosing the default funds. We used probit analysis to determine what demographic factors affected the choice of the default fund, and found that younger people and men with less education and less income were more likely to choose the default; only age was significant for women. We found no significant gender differences in the fund choices of active investors. We conducted linear regression analysis by gender, where the dependent variable was the fund, with fund 1 having the lowest risk and fund 5 having the highest risk. We found that that the risk taking decreased with age and increased with financial knowledge, psychological risk tolerance, income and unemployment. Chilean women and men seemed similar in their investment decisions.

TI  - Consumption smoothing or consumption binging? The effects of government-led consumer credit expansion in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Brazil initiated a major credit expansion program through government banks in 2011. The program primarily targeted public sector workers with offers of payroll -backed loans. Using individual -level administrative data we find that the program led to a 15 percentage point rise in debt to initial income for public sector workers. We develop a new method for estimating workers' expected income growth, and show that "consumption smoothing" cannot explain the rise in consumer borrowing. Instead, the evidence supports "consumption binging": less financially sophisticated workers borrowed more at high real interest rates, and experienced both higher consumption volatility and lower average consumption.

TI  - DETERMINANTS OF LIFE SATISFACTION AMONG FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS IN MALAYSIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - Female-headed households in Malaysia have been a financially vulnerable community in the society where their life satisfaction becomes a question. Therefore, this study aims to determine the factors affecting life satisfaction among female-headed households in Malaysia. A total of 527 respondents who are single, divorced, separated or widowed women, with children in the home including those on public assistance participated in this study which adapted a multi-stage sampling method using self-administered questionnaire. The results show that locus of control, religiosity, financial capability, and financial vulnerability have positive significant relationships with life satisfaction. The multiple regressions show that locus of control, religiosity, financial capability, and financial vulnerability are significant determinants of life satisfaction among female-headed household in Malaysia. More knowledge, and enhancement through financial workshops could be helpful to empower female-headed household on the use of modern financial instruments. Hence, able to increase financial capability and reduce financial vulnerability of female-headed households in Malaysia towards a better life satisfaction.

TI  - The impact of knowledge on labeling schemes promoting sustainable investing
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Sustainable labeling schemes are frequently used to simplify decisions for consumers, for example, in financial contexts, and to subsequently promote sustainable investments. The purpose of this research is to, against the backdrop of dual processing theories, outline consumer reactions to sustainability-oriented investment labels. Experimental results from a representative sample show that objective labels are perceived more favorably by financially knowledgeable individuals. Three developed and validated scales, measuring general and specific financial knowledge as well as environmental knowledge, further suggest that this evaluation is domain contingent, with only knowledge that aligns with choice domain interacting significantly with label format. The importance of the choice domain prevails with regard to the interaction between knowledge and the perceived effectiveness of an investment. We are able to verify retail investor reactions to sustainable labeling, which are of major importance for fund both companies and legislators considering an introduction of mandatory sustainability labeling.

TI  - Helping Those That Hide: Anticipated Stigmatization Drives Concealment and a Destructive Cycle of Debt
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB  - Debt accumulation has been linked to materialism, impulsivity, shortsightedness, self-control, and lifestyle preferences. However, applying stigma theory allows novel insights into debt accumulation for middle-class individuals who access a variety of credit-related products. The authors define anticipated stigmatization of debt as the negative judgment and discrimination an individual expects to experience because of their consumer indebtedness. Results from a series of studies demonstrate that although financial stress motivates behaviors designed to reduce debt, debtors who anticipate stigmatization perform a variety of concealment behaviors (secrecy, social spending, and help avoidance) that hinder debt reduction and have negative effects on well-being. To understand how to help these individuals, the authors collaborated with a financial education company, designing a field experiment to examine the efficacy of a behavior change course. Individuals who anticipated stigmatization and formed new social connections in a community-based condition reduced their consumer debt. Although the emotional effect of community-based support has been examined in other stigma contexts, this study is the first to investigate the effect on well-being in a debt context and link social benefits to actual behavior change in terms of debt reduction behaviors and debt repayment.

TI  - Differences between NZ and US individual investor sentiment: more noise or more information?
T2  - NEW ZEALAND ECONOMIC PAPERS
AB  - In this study, we introduce a newly created sentiment index of individual investors in NZ constructed similar to the well-known sentiment index provided by the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) in the U.S. This unique setup allows us to compare different aspects of investors' behaviour in both countries. We show that NZ market participants are less confident about the directional movement of the stock market, their expectations are more volatile and their distributions have fatter tails. By contrast, both bullish and bearish sentiment is more persistent among U.S. investors. Furthermore, our analysis of return predictability reveals that both groups of investors behave as noise traders. However, the results for NZ investors are stronger. Overall, our findings call for better financial education, particularly in the area of equity investing.

TI  - Drivers and consequences of consumer alienation in the French retail banking sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING ANALYTICS
AB  - The value co-destruction process has been heavily studied in recent years. However, most studies have focused on the value of co-destruction's emotional and behavioral consequences without considering its psychological impact on consumer behavior. This study bridges this research gap by examining consumer alienation as a fundamental psychological state that underpins the value co-destruction process. Its primary objective is to delve into the significance of alienation within retail banking, uncovering its underlying causes and consequences. Furthermore, the study examines how the external locus of control affects the behavior of alienated consumers. The data were collected from 211 French retail bank users. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the hypotheses. The study showed that consumers' discontent, perceived differential treatment, and financial distress lead to value destruction and influence consumer alienation toward retail banking service providers. A high level of alienation leads to payment delinquency, negative WOM, and switching intentions to internet-only banks. The external locus of control moderates these relationships. By identifying the antecedents and consequences of consumer alienation in retail banking, this study provides practical advice to retail banking providers on retroactively identifying alienated consumers. This study provides ideas on restoring lost value, retaining customers, and preventing them from switching to internet-only banks. Our research enriches the Service-Dominant Logic theory by exploring the role of consumer alienation on the value co-destruction process. It enhances the understanding of consumer alienation in retail banking.

TI  - Human Capital Investment for Adolescents: Barriers and Opportunities
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - The decision to attend college is a question of human capital investment, yet resources to help practitioners frame human capital investment decisions remain elusive and few include the "gold standard" of finance: net present value (NPV). Can one discuss human capital investment with an average adolescent using a traditional NPV approach? Motivated by this question, we presented 10 barriers to maximizing education-career NPV (e.g., clarity of costs, immature adolescent brains, individual discount rates). We outline an iterative, research-based approach to education-career investment, including framing the conversation, calculating paired NPVs, and structuring the decision. This multistep framework leverages practitioner expertise to help adolescents consider important lifelong financial wellness implications of human capital investment.

TI  - Discrimination and Economic Expectations
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - This paper examines whether perceptions of discrimination affect the economic expectations of U.S. households. We focus on two forms of expectations that play a central role in economic and financial decisions of households: labor income and inflation. Using experimental data, we demonstrate that discrimination generates greater dispersion in household forecasts. It increases subjective expectations of income uncertainty by 8% and inflation uncertainty by 5%. The impact of discrimination is concentrated among racial/ethnic minorities, inducing 12%-16% greater variation in their income uncertainty expectations and 10%-12% greater variation in their inflation uncertainty expectations. Both psychological and emotional factors appear to influence the discrimination-economic expectations relation.

TI  - How explicit consumer credit information affects intent to purchase on credit: an experiment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeConsumer culture is promoting immediate gratification, and the rise of digital financial services is increasing the risk of indebtedness while debt reduces well-being and affects mental health. The authors assess the effects of consumer information provision, debt literacy, chronic debt and attitudes toward debt on the intent to purchase on credit.Design/methodology/approachAn online survey including an experiment with a credit offer vignette was conducted in a representative sample of Estonia (n = 1204). Treatment conditions depicted either the total cost and duration of the credit agreement or the annual percentage rate.FindingsReceiving modified information resulted in a 26 to 30 percentage points decrease in propensity to purchase on credit. Purchasing on credit was associated with attitudes towards credit and chronic debt, but not with debt literacy.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings reveal large effects of information provision and highlight the limited effects of debt literacy on credit decisions. Limitations may emerge from differences in financial regulation across countries.Practical implicationsThe authors' results highlight the importance of applying behavioural insights in consumer credit information provision, both in the financial sector and policy. Testing the messages allows having evidence-based solutions that promote responsible purchasing on credit.Originality/valueThe findings call for changes in credit information provision requirements. Their effect is significantly larger compared to the literature, emphasizing the role of credit information provision in less regulated online markets.Table A1Appendix 3Table A2Originality/valueThe findings call for changes in credit information provision requirements.

TI  - Probing the impact of recognition-based heuristic biases on investment decision-making and performance
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore and clarify the mechanism by which recognition-based heuristic biases influence the investment decision-making and performance of individual investors, with the mediating role of fundamental and technical anomalies. Design/methodology/approach The deductive approach was used, as the research is based on behavioral finance's theoretical framework. A questionnaire and cross-sectional design were employed for data collection from the sample of 323 individual investors trading on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). Hypotheses were tested through the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. Findings The article provides further insights into the relationship between recognition-based heuristic-driven biases and investment management activities. The results suggest that recognition-based heuristic-driven biases have a markedly positive influence on investment decision-making and negatively influence the investment performance of individual investors. The results also suggest that fundamental and technical anomalies mediate the relationships between the recognition-based heuristic-driven biases on the one hand and investment management activities on the other. Practical implications The results of the study suggested that investment management activities that rely on recognition-based heuristics would not result in better returns to investors. The article encourages investors to base decisions on investors' financial capability and experience levels and to avoid relying on recognition-based heuristics when making decisions related to investment management activities. The results provides awareness and understanding of recognition-based heuristic-driven biases in investment management activities, which could be very useful for decision-makers and professionals in financial institutions, such as portfolio managers and traders in commercial banks, investment banks and mutual funds. This paper helps investors to select better investment tools and avoid repeating the expensive errors that occur due to recognition-based heuristic-driven biases. Originality/value The current study is the first to focus on links recognition-based heuristic-driven biases, fundamental and technical anomalies, investment decision-making and performance of individual investors. This article enhanced the understanding of the role that recognition-based heuristic-driven biases plays in investment management. More importantly, the study went some way toward enhancing understanding of behavioral aspects and the aspects' influence on investment decision-making and performance in an emerging market.

TI  - Influence of contextual factors on investment decision-making: a fuzzy-AHP approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIA BUSINESS STUDIES
AB  - Purpose The behavioural decision-making process of individuals highlights the importance of investors' sentiment and their correlation with the real economy. This paper aims to contribute to the literature of behavioural finance by examining the influence of contextual factors on investment decision-making. Design/methodology/approach Using a questionnaire, a total of 445 valid responses were collected from March to May 2021 through online sources. The current study uses a technique of Fuzzy-analytical hierarchical process (AHP) to assign relative weights to various contextual factors influencing investment decision-making. Harman's single factor test was used to check common method bias. Findings Results of the study reveal that accounting information, self-image/firm-image coincidence, and neutral information as the top-ranked factors in influencing investment decisions, whereas advocate recommendation and personal financial needs emerged as less important factors in influencing investment decisions. Research limitations/implications The current study collects data from Indian stock market investors, which may limit the generalization of the study to India only. Moreover, this study is cross-sectional in nature, and there are numerous factors that are not part of the study but might significantly influence the investors' decision-making process. Practical implications The research has implications for both academicians working in the area of behavioural finance and practitioners' who are active in stock markets, more specifically dealing with retail investors and in the domain of personal finance. Also, the current study will accommodate different groups, i.e. policy makers, financial advisors, investors, investment professionals, etc. in carrying out their professional work. Originality/value The current study will provide a comprehensive overview of individual investor behaviour. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the present study is one of its kind to use the Fuzzy-AHP technique for evaluating the relative ranks of contextual factors influencing investment decision-making.

TI  - Discrimination and Economic Expectations
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - This paper examines whether perceptions of discrimination affect the economic expectations of U.S. households. We focus on two forms of expectations that play a central role in economic and financial decisions of households: labor income and inflation. Using experimental data, we demonstrate that discrimination generates greater dispersion in household forecasts. It increases subjective expectations of income uncertainty by 8% and inflation uncertainty by 5%. The impact of discrimination is concentrated among racial/ethnic minorities, inducing 12%-16% greater variation in their income uncertainty expectations and 10%-12% greater variation in their inflation uncertainty expectations. Both psychological and emotional factors appear to influence the discrimination-economic expectations relation.

TI  - Readability of Korean-Language advertising disclosures moderates knowledge effects
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose Government policy mandates information disclosure in financial communications to protect consumer welfare. Unfortunately, low readability can hamper information disclosures' meaningful benefits to financial decision making. Thus, this experiment tests the product evaluation and decision satisfaction of Korean consumers with less or more subjective knowledge and with or without personal finance education. Design/methodology/approach A between-subjects experiment examined responses of a nationally representative sample of 400 Korean consumers toward a Korean-language credit card advertisement. Findings Financial knowledge improves financial product evaluation and decision satisfaction. More readable disclosures improved evaluation and satisfaction among less knowledgeable consumers. Less readable disclosures did not. Consumers without financial education exhibited lower evaluations and decision satisfaction regardless of readability. More knowledgeable consumers and those with financial education performed equally well regardless of disclosure readability. Practical implications Financial service providers seeking more accurate evaluations and better decision satisfaction among their customers should use easier-to-read disclosures when targeting consumers with less prior financial knowledge. Social implications One-size-fits-all financial communications are unlikely to achieve public policy or consumer well-being goals. Government-mandated information should be complemented by augmenting financial knowledge and providing personal finance training. Originality/value Although almost a quarter of the world's population lives in East Asia, this is the first examination of readability in disclosures written in East Asian characters rather than a Western alphabet. Previous readability research on Asian-originating financial disclosures has been conducted on English-language texts. This study extends knowledge of readability effects to growing East Asian markets.

TI  - Does regional gender inequality affect stock market participation? Evidence from China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMY
AB  - In this article, we examine whether regional gender inequality affects a household's decision to participate in stock market in China. Based on a nationwide micro data, our empirical results show that households in counties with greater gender inequality are less likely to hold risky assets. The results are robust to a number of variations in our empirical models. The negative effect of gender inequality on household stock market participation is stronger for households located in northern China. Moreover, we provide evidence suggestive of the role of the declined social interaction operating through gender inequality.

TI  - Leveraging Psychological Fit to Encourage Saving Behavior
T2  - AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST
AB  - Despite their best intentions, most people fail to save enough for the future. In this research, we demonstrate that people are more successful at saving when their savings goals are aligned with their Big Five personality traits. Study 1 uses a nationally representative sample of 2,447 U.K. citizens to test whether people whose self-declared savings goals more closely match their Big Five personality also report higher levels of savings. We apply specification curve analyses to minimize the risk of having arbitrary analytical decisions produce false-positive results. As our findings show, person-goal fit significantly predicted savings across all 48 specifications. Study 2 expands these findings by testing whether psychological fit can influence savings even if the saving goals are not formulated by the individuals themselves but instead suggested by a technology service designed to help them save. In a field experiment with 6,056 U.S.-based low-income users of a nonprofit Fintech app (with <$100 in current savings), we show that people who were encouraged to save $100 over the course of a month were more likely to achieve this target if they were encouraged to save toward personality-matched goals. Our research provides support for the theory of psychological fit, showing that an alignment between an individual's Big Five personality traits and the personality appeal of a saving goal can help increase savings, even among those who struggle the most.

TI  - Antecedents of indebtedness for low-income consumers: the mediating role of materialism
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this is to propose a model in which materialism is a mediator of the effects of self-esteem, impulsiveness, attitude toward debt, attitude toward credit card and economic vulnerability on consumer indebtedness. The effects of financial knowledge, financial ability, credit card use and demographic variables are also taken into account. Design/methodology/approach Survey data from a sample of 1,245 low-income consumers from Brazil were used to test the hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Findings First, materialism has a significant effect on consumer indebtedness; at the same time, it is influenced by self-esteem, impulsiveness and attitude toward debt. Second, materialism acts as a mediator, e.g. higher impulsiveness triggers materialism, which influences debt level. Third, indebtedness is higher for women and those who use a higher number of credit cards and are more educated.

T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper studies the relationship framework between individual and group acts of stock trading activities in the Tehran stock exchange which leads to the development of a cohesive relationship model for individual and group acts of stock trading behaviors. It has a quantitative-qualitative hybrid approach in which the model is designed by using the Delphi technique at the first stage, and it is tested and assessed by using the structural equation modeling method at the second stage. The model shows that areas of financial capability, financial capacity, word-of-mouth communication, mass media, financial consultation, stock trading behaviors, and personality are considered as causal conditions of relationship framework of individual and group acts that affect that process positively and meaningfully.

TI  - One size fits all? Tailoring retirement plan defaults
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Default investment options in retirement plans are a potent influence on member choice, however little is known about how plans set them. We investigate how retirement plan providers choose default investment strategies for passive members. We interview plan executives and survey members during a review of default settings in 2013-14 prompted by a change in the regulation of the Australian retirement system. Passive plan members are different from active members in ways that matter for investment strategy. Passive members are less willing to take financial risks; they are also younger, less wealthy and more often female. Executives say they design defaults with passive members in mind, but they seem to overlook some key factors. For example, plan executives set high risk exposure in default investment strategies. Executives also assume motivations for defaulting that do not match those reported by members. Most plan executives think of passive members as uninterested in their retirement savings but passive members say they trust their plans, and lack skill rather than interest. The heterogeneity, trust and low skill of passive members make opting out of the default less likely and smart defaults more appealing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS INSTITUTIONS & MONEY
AB  - Using a panel of 38 economies, over the period 2001-2010, we analyse the link between different facets of education and diversification in international portfolios. We find that university education, mathematical numeracy, in addition to financial skill, play an important role in reducing home bias. After separating countries according to their level of financial development, we find that less developed economies with more university graduates, or with higher level of mathematical numeracy, have lower level of local equity bias compared to more developed countries. We also find that the beneficial effect of education is more pronounced during the most recent financial crisis, especially for economies with less developed financial markets. (C) 2015 The Authors.

TI  - The One-Man Show: The Effect of Joint Decision-Making on Investor Overconfidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB  - This study examines the impact of shared decision-making on investor overconfidence. Data from 2,000 investors, 6,394 consumers, and 657 experimental participants shed light on whether consumers who engage in joint financial decision-making are less affected by investor overconfidence than those who decide on their own. The findings show that investors who jointly decide are substantially less overconfident. However, family- or friend-inclined interactions are more effective in reducing overconfidence than relying on a financial advisor. The current research theoretically argues and empirically shows that shared metaknowledge drives this diminishing effect by highlighting unknown aspects of a financial decision. Compared to providing investors with solutions, problem reformulation, validation, or legitimation, only metaknowledge consistently decreases overconfidence in joint financial decision-making. It is argued that the process of highlighting unknowns can explain why interactions with family and friends have a more pronounced impact on investor overconfidence than consulting a professional advisor. The study provides a feasible debiasing tool to consumers, financial institutions, and other financial service providers to decrease overconfidence by emphasizing unknown aspects of an investment toward improving the quality of a consumer's financial decisions under uncertainty.

TI  - Individual and peer effects in retirement savings investment choices
T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - This paper explores the role of a member's peers in the member's propensity to make a change to their retirement savings investment strategy. Given that evidence indicates that the majority of individuals do not seek professional financial advice, we investigate whether workplace peers may be influential in member retirement savings investment strategy behaviour. We explore three ways a peer influence may manifest. First, we examine whether the likelihood that an individual makes an investment strategy change is related to what their work place peers do. Second, we explore whether the workplace gender composition (critical mass) is associated with the individual member's likelihood of changing investment strategy. Building on the second, our third interest is in the role of gender critical mass as a moderator of a member's gender on choice. The results suggest that member investment decisions are influenced by their peers' behaviour, especially the behaviour of workplace peers of the same gender. Workplace gender composition, on the other hand, does not alter member decisions.

TI  - Household Portfolio Underdiversification and Probability Weighting: Evidence from the Field
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - We test whether probability weighting affects household portfolio choice in a representative survey. On average, people display inverse-S-shaped probability weighting, overweighting low probability events. As theory predicts, probability weighting is positively associated with portfolio underdiversification and significant Sharpe ratio losses. Analyzing respondents' individual stock holdings, we find higher probability weighting is associated with owning lottery-type stocks and positively skewed equity portfolios. People with higher probability weighting are less likely to own mutual funds and more likely to either avoid equities or hold individual stocks. We are the first to empirically link individuals' elicited probability weighting and real-world decisions under risk.

TI  - Risk Perception as a Predictor of Heuristic Biases: The Role of Sex and Age
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - This paper analyzes the relationship between investors' risk perception, heuristic biases (overconfidence, representativeness, availability bias, and anchoring bias), and the moderating role of sex and age. Since it is evident from the literature that investor risk perceptions affect investors rationally, the study explores the impact of risk perception on mental shortcuts or heuristic decision-making. The authors collected the data from 447 individual investors using a self-administered questionnaire to investigate the proposed phenomenon. After confirming the validity and reliability of the data obtained, we employed structural equation modeling to evaluate the relationship between risk perception and heuristic biases. We used process macro to scrutinize the moderating effect of sex and age in the mentioned constructs. The study demonstrates that risk perception affects three heuristic biases (i.e. anchoring, representativeness, and availability bias). Further, the outcome exhibits that the sex of a person moderates the relationship between risk perception and availability bias. The study could be helpful for individual investors, investment advisors, and policymakers. The investment advisor can gain insights into the different mental shortcuts their customers take to guide them appropriately. Governments and relevant policymakers can gain insights into the roadblocks to rational investment decisions to ensure the correct appraisal of the stock market. The present study fills the necessity to realize the effect of investors' risk perception on decision-making heuristics and the moderating role of sex and age in the phenomenon.

TI  - How "What you think you know about cybersecurity" can help users make more secure decisions
T2  - INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT
AB  - The increasing use of information technology artifacts in daily life makes security a shared responsibility of both users and companies. In recent years, increasing a user's objective (i.e., actual) security knowledge and providing applications with more secure default settings appear among the most ubiquitous tools companies use to broaden their efforts to help users make more secure decisions. Examining both solutions matters because they are widely used, cost effective, and understood by many security practitioners. Additionally, default settings and users' objective knowledge provide anchors for decision-making. However, human errors and insecure default settings are increasing and raising further questions about the efficacy of such efforts. Using the theory of bounded rationality, we investigated the role of objective, subjective (i.e., self-assessed) security knowledge, and default settings security level on the overall decision security. We found that objective security knowledge can lead to secure decisions when paired with high subjective security knowledge. In the absence of the latter, objective security knowledge is unable to lead to better security decisions. Furthermore, subjective security knowledge reduces the extent to which users fully accept default security settings, thereby mitigating bias toward insecure default settings.

TI  - How consumers evaluate costs in complex services: the case of mutual fund fees
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB  - PurposeIn modern societies, consumer well-being is dependent on choices regarding complex services, such as investments, health care, insurance and lending. However, evaluating costs of such services is often difficult for consumers due to a combination of limited cognitive resources and complexity of the service. The purpose of this study is to empirically examine to what extent three specific consequences of complexity influence consumer tendencies to make mistakes when evaluating the costs (or price) of complex services.Design/methodology/approachThree studies were conducted (survey: n = 153, experiment: n = 332 and conjoint analysis: n = 225), all focusing on how consumers evaluate costs in the complex mutual fund setting.FindingsThe authors find that consumers struggle with estimating and using cost information in decision-making in the complex services setting. Consumers of complex services frequently underestimate the costs over the long-term, may see costs as a signal of service quality and are susceptible to influence from presentation formats when evaluating costs.Research limitations/implicationsThe study investigates mutual funds, which is one example of a complex service. In order to get a full picture of how consumers deal with costs in complex setting, future research needs to expand this focus to other types of complex services.Practical implicationsThe results have implications for both marketers of complex services and policymakers. For marketers, this paper highlights that competing with a low-cost strategy may be difficult in the complex services setting as consumers may lack the ability to actually evaluate what they pay over the long term. For policymakers, increased simplification of prices may be an attractive option. However, it is important that this simplification is done in a way that increases the possibility to compare prices.Originality/valueAs complexity influences several aspects of decision-making, an understanding of how consumers evaluate costs in complex settings is dependent on taking a multidimensional research approach. This paper makes a novel contribution to the literature on pricing by showing that consumers struggle with multiple aspects when evaluating costs in complex contexts. Understanding these effects is important to policy, as well as to research on the cognitive value of simplicity that is currently gaining traction in marketing research.

TI  - Improving Debt Literacy by 2/3 Through Four Simple Infographics Requires Numeracy and Not Focusing on Negatives of Debt
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Borrowing behavior may be more resistant to formal educational treatments than other financial behaviors. In order to study the process and results of infographics-based debt education, we used eye tracking technology (SMI RED 500 Hz) to monitor the oculomotor behavior of 108 participants (68 females) aged 18 to 60 who were shown 4 infographics. The study used an experimental design with repeated measures and an internal comparison group. We also used scales of debt literacy and a set of information literacy scales: numerical, graph, and linguistic. The results confirm that short-term infographics-based debt education can improve debt literacy significantly. The difference in processing the educational contents that were not known to participants before the educational session suggests that participants with better information literacy make more considerable debt literacy progress. Specifically, we found that numerical literacy is a significant mediator of debt education results, depending on the initial level of debt literacy; this relation is moderated by the focus of visual attention on negatives of debt. We found no significant relationship between debt literacy education results and those of graph and linguistic literacy.

AB  - We study the effects of two exogenous modifications in the Swedish pension system application form nudging individuals towards a fixed-term payout. Meanwhile, the set of available options and the default option-life annuity-were unchanged during the period under study. We examine the effects on individuals' payout decisions and the spillover effects on labour supply and other pensions using a difference-in-difference framework and detailed administrative data on actual payout decisions and a wide range of individual-level outcomes. Each modification increased the demand for the nudged payout by around 30 percentage points. The first modification also induced individuals to work less.

TI  - Cash holdings and health shocks
T2  - REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH
AB  - We are the first to investigate how health shocks relate to cash holdings. Using three waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study over the period 2013-2018, we document that, for middle-aged and elderly people living in rural China, the onset of an acute health condition is associated with a 3.0 percentage point higher probability of holding only cash as a safe asset, and a 2.3 percentage point higher proportion of safe assets held in the form of cash. These results are robust to using different samples and estimation methods. We also find that ex-post reimbursement of medical expenses and lack of bank accessibility may drive the association between health shocks and cash holdings.

TI  - Adapting to the new normal: A sustainable livelihood framework for the informal sectors during COVID-19
T2  - REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - The extraordinary COVID-19 outbreak has heightened the existential dangers to the informal sector. This study explores the informal sector's tactics in Vietnam for mitigating the pandemic's effects and better adapting to the new normal. Using a sustainable livelihood approach (SLA) and multivariate model for ordered choices (MVOC) to conduct surveys on 513 subjects from the informal labor, our findings indicate that financial management is the most prevalent technique for mitigating the effects of COVID-19. Notably, the perception of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on income and health is crucial to the adoption of mitigation efforts. The Vietnamese government, State Bank, and financial institutions should provide more help to the informal sector, particularly those operating in remote locations so that they can increase their resilience through mitigating measures. In parallel, the informal sector should participate in more deliberate forward mitigation planning in the anticipation of inevitable future shocks.

TI  - Mediating Role of Risk Perception Between Behavioral Biases and Investor's Investment Decisions
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - This study aims to examine the direct and indirect links between behavioral biases and investor's investment decisions via the mediating role of risk perception through structural equation modeling. The study is conducted among individual investors who are engaged in investment for several years in Pakistan Stock Exchange. Purposive sampling technique was used for data collection and the sample size was consisted of 450 questionnaires. The findings contribute that risk perception mediates between blue-chip stocks and investment decisions. Furthermore, risk perception does not play the mediating role between herding bias, disposition effect, and investment decisions. However, the disposition effect has a strong direct relationship with risk perception. The study is beneficial to individual investors who can make investment decisions by self-estimation rather than to follow the others' opinion. The proper training and education to the investors is also an appropriate path to overcome these biases. Risk is the major factor that discourages investment decisions but blue-chip stocks are a major risk eliminating factor while building investment decisions. Most of the prior studies focused on behavioral biases and investment decisions of individual investors but this study contributed to the mediating effect of risk perception. Human capital, anomalies, computer literacy, and artificial technology could also be used as a mediator and moderator for future orientation.

TI  - Connecting Saving and Food Security: Evidence from an Asset-Building Program for Families in Poverty
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - This study examines food insecurity among children of participants in a federally funded savings program in the United States, the Individual Development Account (IDA) program. We measure child food insecurity of savings program families by using the eight questions of the Current Population Survey's Food Security Supplement. About 39.4% of savings program families report food insecurity. No differences in children's food hardship between current and past program participants were identified. Examining predictors, propensity to plan for money tend to be associated with higher odds of children's food insecurity. By contrast, frugal behavior, lower material deprivation, and higher subjective well-being tend to reduce the odds of children's food insecurity. Findings also confirm previous literature on the association of alternative financial services and higher food insecurity among children.

TI  - Intention towards renewable energy investments in Malaysia: extending theory of planned behaviour
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Renewable energy investments possess great potential for reducing the consumption of fossil fuels influenced by various determinants. This study investigates the individual investors' renewable energy investments' intention within the framework of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) based on a survey conducted in 3 major states in Malaysia. The results indicate that one's intention to invest in renewable energy investments is influenced by attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioural control and evaluation of regulatory framework. Risk aversion on the other hand was found to have no effect on investors' intention towards such investments. The findings also reveal that the evaluation of regulatory framework is the most important determinant. This outcome contradicts the outcomes arrived at by the previous studies that focus on investment behaviours or other types of pro-environmentally intention or behaviours. This research also investigates the indirect effects of TPB on explaining investor's intention towards renewable energy investments through the evaluation of regulatory framework. The results indicate that the investors' intention towards renewable energy investments is indirectly influenced by attitude and perceived behavioural control. Subjective norm does not have an indirect effect on investors' intention towards renewable energy investments. This study provides policymakers' important practical implications to improve renewable energy investments.

TI  - Reverse mortgages: What homeowners (don't) know and how it matters
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Reverse mortgages allow elderly homeowners to unlock and consume home equity without leaving their homes. Relative to the number of elderly homeowners with limited financial resources, the take-up rates of reverse mortgages are low. To understand the low takeup rates we first survey U.S. homeowners aged 58 and older assessing their knowledge (literacy) about the most popular reverse mortgage product, the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). Next, we study the relationship between knowledge and the intention to use a HECM. Awareness of reverse mortgages is high, but knowledge of contract terms is limited. More knowledgeable homeowners and those with peers who have a reverse mortgage express greater intentionto use such a product. Respondents who would benefit most from reverse mortgages (those with low incomes and limited savings) express greater intention to use reverse mortgages, but lack knowledge of the contract terms. Our findings suggest that take-up rates might be increased through improving knowledge about contract terms or changing the product's design to make it easier to understand in the first place.

TI  - A research design for promoting and examining content knowledge and argumentation skills in socio-economic contexts in German-speaking countries
T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB  - Economic education is an essential prerequisite for coping with economic-characterised problems in various life spheres, especially with socio-economic problems in the societal sphere. Making informed and reasoned decisions on socio-economic problems requires domain-specific content knowledge and domain-specific argumentation skills. Economic education is anchored in many framework curricula at secondary school level in German-speaking countries. Yet, despite its curricular and practical relevance, empirical studies in the economic domain that address both students' content knowledge and argumentation skills are rare. This article outlines a research design for a proposed intervention study that aims to promote and examine content knowledge and argumentation skills in socio-economic contexts. The research design is built on three core elements: (1) a workshop on teachers' pedagogical content knowledge, (2) a problem-oriented teaching/learning setting with authentic socio-economic problems and (3) instruments and frameworks to assess students' competence. The research design serves as a starting point for an internationally comparable research programme, primarily applicable for grammar schools in German-speaking countries.

TI  - Calmness instead of panicking: re-thinking the resource allocation strategies in an era of uncertainty: a case of a developing country
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
AB  - PurposeDrawing on the concept of superior resource, capability and processes of the resource-based theory of the firm, the purpose of the current study is to analyze the influence of firms' winner-picking strategic approach on firm performance (FP) via a direct and indirect mechanism.Design/methodology/approachUsing survey data of 104 diversified manufacturing firms, the current study analyzed the conditional indirect effect of firms' strategic approach on efficient resource allocation with the help of Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) process macros.FindingsThe study found that firms' choices of winner-picking approach can undermine the resource allocation efficiency when not perfectly blended with firms' access to the resource. Furthermore, the effect of winner-picking strategy (WPS) on resource allocation efficiency via firms' competitive advantage (CA) can be greater when both strategic choice and resources are employed adequately.Research limitations/implicationsDespite making a unique contribution, the present study has a few limitations requiring researchers' attention to be tackled in the forthcoming. This includes a little amount of data, a self-reporting technique and failure to include all the possible reasons that could lead to inefficient resource allocation.Practical implicationsThe present research has potential applications for managers of the manufacturing industry in a period of sheer uncertainty [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)]. First, the study alerts managers about the challenges of underinvestment and overinvestment while allocating resources. At the same time, this study provides an important implication for managing the importance of firms' access to capital (AC).Originality/valueThe current study has made a sizeable impression in the literature on internal resource allocation and resource-based theory of the firm by recommending a model that augments the theoretical foundation of strategic management of the firms. As there are only a handful of studies on this grave issue in the context of developing economies, thus, closely considering these insights would be helping for the firms for allocating resources efficiently in the manufacturing industry.

TI  - Who is more important, parents or children? Economic and environmental factors and health insurance purchase
T2  - NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB  - The existing research indicates that insurance demand is affected by the policyholder's occupation, family economy, urbanization level, and insurance coverage. Using micro data of insurance purchase at the individual level, this study investigates the influence of economic and environmental factors on the priorities of health insurance purchase decision. The results reveal that the more developed the economy and the more financial knowledge people possess, the more the latter tend to prioritize health insurance for their children. Furthermore, the study investigates the influence of air pollution on the decision to purchase health insurance. If the air pollution level is high, policyholders prioritize obtaining insurance for their children. Our research on the order of insurance purchase indicates that Chinese families have a lack of support from their children, and the function of family pension is gradually weakening. Our research also reveals that families are willing to spend money on the insurance of their children. Therefore, to solve the problem of health and old-age security for the elderly, it is more effective to promote health insurance by considering families as a unit

TI  - Entrepreneurship Competence Model for Supporting Learners Development at All Educational Levels
T2  - ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - The development of entrepreneurship competence considering a broad view of entrepreneurship requires a systematic approach to determine the validated content of learning and methodological basis for supporting learners' entrepreneurial attitudes and behaviour. There is still relatively little research in this area at all levels of education. Addressing entrepreneurship competence as key competence of lifelong learning allows to broaden the understanding and describe the development of different aspects of entrepreneurship competence through meaningful and supportive interactions in the learning environment. This will allow a better understanding of how to support entrepreneurship competence in various courses and age groups. In this article, a framework of entrepreneurship competence called the Comprehensive Entrepreneurship Competence Model (CECM) is proposed. The development of an entrepreneurship competence model relies on the theory of systems thinking. The CECM model focuses on the developmental perspective (fundamental processes of human development) that is not emphasised in other models. The article also suggests how to support the development of entrepreneurship competence systematically at all levels of education through embedding entrepreneurship competence into the curricula, study programmes of different subjects and overall learning processes.

TI  - The home bias and the local bias: A survey
T2  - MANAGEMENT REVIEW QUARTERLY
AB  - The home bias like the disposition effect is a well-researched economic phenomenon in investor behaviour which has been examined in finance journal articles for decades. While there is little doubt about the existence of the bias, its magnitude varies across countries and investor groups. The home bias has to be regarded as a multifactorial phenomenon, a combination of numerous causes which all synergistically contribute. In contrast to other biases the home bias can at least partially be explained by reasons beyond irrational investor behaviour. While institutional restrictions play a minor role, informational asymmetries and superior information of domestic investors are important factors. Thus, the performance of investments may well benefit from a home bias, and the bias then no longer would be a puzzle but rather rational behaviour as a lower diversification level may lead to higher returns. The contemporary understanding of the home bias gains in relevance as the ongoing political debate in Germany has to clarify an institutional framework for long-run retirement savings plans of private households based on equity investments.

TI  - Hedonism, hedonistic shopping experiences and compulsive buying tendency: a demographics-based model approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - Although consumer and marketing research has focused on identifying various precursors of compulsive buying behavior, little attention has been paid to more complex relationships examined from the perspective of hedonism as a personal value, hedonic shopping experiences, and consumer demographics. Thus, the present study postulates a mediation model in which the extent of hedonisms relationship to compulsive buying via hedonistic shopping experiences is diagnosed, and proceeds to moderation effects based on consumer demographic characteristics (i.e gender, age, education). Using data (N = 1,245) from a representative survey, and based on structural equation modeling, results revealed that hedonism significantly influences compulsive buying via hedonistic shopping experiences, while moderation effects indicated that these relationships were stronger in younger individuals, mostly women. In contrast, these effects were nonsignificant with regard to consumers' education level. The studys findings are discussed in terms of the theoretical and practical insights to better understand and prevent contemporary consumerism trends related to hedonism, hedonistic shopping, and compulsive buying tendencies. The research also offers important public policy and retailing implications.

TI  - Investor sentiment and stock returns: Global evidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE
AB  - We assess the impact of investor sentiment on future stock returns in 50 global stock markets. Using the consumer confidence index (CCI) as the sentiment proxy, we document a negative relationship between investor sentiment and future stock returns at the global level. While the separation between developed and emerging markets does not disrupt the negative pattern, investor sentiment has a more instant impact in emerging markets, but a more enduring impact in developed markets. Individual stock markets reveal heterogeneity in the sentiment-return relationship. This heterogeneity can be explained by cross-market differences in culture and institutions, along with intelligence and education, to varying degrees influenced by the extent of individual investor market participation.

TI  - Which consumers are more likely to adopt a retirement app and how does it explain mobile technology-enabled retirement engagement?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Although planning for retirement is fundamental for consumers' future well-being, individuals often fail to engage with it. Retirement engagement refers to one's initial interest in and active planning for one's retirement. In this study, we focus on mobile technology-enabled retirement engagement, operationalized as consumers' perception of how a retirement app can help them plan for retirement. While rapid advances in digital platforms and mobile technology show promising use to the financial services sector, little is known about the adoption drivers of mobile technology in stimulating retirement engagement as a unique low-involvement, yet high-importance context. We address this gap in the existing literature by analyzing survey data from a representative sample of 440 Australian pension fund members. We find that consumers' financial self-efficacy, perceived financial security, consideration of future consequences, retirement planning involvement, and perceived usefulness have direct effects on their anticipated engagement with a mobile retirement app as well as indirect effects through their intention to adopt the app (financial self-efficacy and consideration of future consequences only have direct effects). We also find that mobile computing self-efficacy, prior finance app use, and perceived ease of use only have indirect effects through consumers' intention to adopt the app. Notably, the association between adoption intentions and anticipated engagement is stronger for those closer to retirement.

TI  - Exploring the first steps of retirement engagement: a conceptual model and field evidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF SERVICE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The authors develop and validate a conceptual model, the retirement engagement model (REM), to understand the relationships between behavioral engagement (retirement information search), cognitive factors and engagement (e.g. beliefs and financial knowledge), emotional engagement (e.g. anxiety), and socio-demographic factors. Approach: The authors derive the REM through a three-step procedure: (1) an extensive literature review, (2) interactive feedback sessions with experts to confirm the model's academic and managerial relevance, and (3) an empirical test of the REM with field data (N = 583). The authors use a partial least squares (PLS) structural equation model and examine heterogeneity through a finite mixture model. Design/methodology/approach Around the globe, people are insufficiently engaged with retirement planning. The customer engagement literature offers rich insights into antecedents, outcomes, and barriers to engagement. However, customer engagement literature lacks insights into cognitive, emotional and behavioral factors that drive engagement in retirement planning, a utilitarian service context, which is important for financial well-being. Findings Beliefs such as perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy, together with trust and retirement anxiety, explain people's search for pension information. These factors can be used to define three clear, actionable segments of consumers. Originality/value The findings advance the customer engagement and transformative service research literature by generating insights on engagement with retirement planning, a utilitarian rather than hedonic service context that is especially relevant for financial well-being. The findings inform managerial practice and emphasize the relevance of including cognitive and emotional engagement factors that trigger behavioral engagement. The REM can help to improve pension communication. For example, the results indicate that marketers should stress the benefits of, rather than the barriers to, acquiring information.

TI  - Moderating Loss Aversion: Loss Aversion Has Moderators, But Reports of its Death are Greatly Exaggerated
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Loss aversion, the principle that losses impact decision making more than equivalent gains, is a fundamental idea in consumer behavior and decision making, though its existence has recently been called into question. Across five unique samples (N-total = 17,720), we tested several moderators of loss aversion, which supported a preference construction account. Across studies, more domain knowledge and experience were associated with lower loss aversion, though people of all knowledge and experience levels were loss averse. Among car buyers, those who knew more about a particular car attribute (e.g., fuel economy) were less loss averse for that attribute but not other attributes (e.g., comfort), consistent with the idea that people with less attribute knowledge are more likely to construct preferences, thereby increasing loss aversion. Additionally, older consumers were more loss averse across different loss aversion measures and studies. We discuss implications for several accounts of loss aversion, including accounts rooted in status quo bias, emotion, or ownership. In addition to discovering loss aversion moderators, we cast doubt on recent claims that loss aversion is a fallacy or is fully explained by status quo bias, risk aversion, or the educated laboratory samples often used to study loss aversion.

TI  - Do emotions, desires and habits influence mutual fund investing? A study using the model of goal-directed behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine whether affective factors such as goal desires, positive anticipated emotions, anticipated regret and non-volitional actions like habits influence retail mutual fund investing. Design/methodology/approach Using the model of goal-directed behavior (MGB), the impact of affective factors and habits was compared against a cognitively driven model. Data were collected through a survey of 321 mutual fund investors across India and analyzed using the partial least squares method. Findings Goal-based desires were a significant driver of investing intentions while actual investing was driven by habits. Anticipated regret strongly influenced desires. The overall explanation of variance in intentions and investing behaviors was improved by 27 and 28% respectively by the new model. Research limitations/implications The current investments in mutual funds is used as a proxy for future investing behaviors so results need to be interpreted accordingly. Future research directions could include the effects of mood, impact of language, religion and culture. Practical implications For "emotionally complex" cultures, impact of emotive drivers and habits play a significant part in investing and fund houses need to orient their marketing accordingly. Social implications Awareness programs on how emotive issues and habits can hinder as well as enhance investment performance in markets would benefit retail investors. Originality/value The study is unique in analyzing affective and non-volitional factors and in showing that intentions are not sufficient to explain behaviors. It analyzes not just intentions as most studies do, but end behaviors of investors as well. It uses the MGB theoretical framework from behavioral psychology that has not been applied to financial behaviors before.

TI  - The impacts of emotions and personality on borrowers' abilities to manage their debts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - This paper examines the impacts of retail borrowers' emotions and personality traits on their abilities to engage in appropriate responses when things unexpectedly go wrong and they get into debt repayment difficulties. We establish several scenarios where borrowers are hit with unforeseen circumstances that affect their abilities to make their loan payments and we classify and evaluate the riskiness of the strategies they state that they would adopt in those situations. Via an extensive on-line survey conducted in the UK, we show that borrowers who were most comfortable about taking on debts in the first place, those who show neurotic tendencies, and those who believe that they have control over events rather than being controlled by them, are more likely to undertake high risk strategies when faced with unforeseen issues that affect their ability to meet their debt interest and repayment costs. We also find that respondents who identify as feeling excited, alert or guilty, as well as younger borrowers and those who are single or renters, are more likely to opt for risky approaches. Our findings have potentially important implications for lenders, regulators and debt counselling services regarding the types of people who are most likely to get into debt troubles.

TI  - Assessing the macroeconomic effects of China-Eastern African BRI transport infrastructure on Eastern African countries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS
AB  - The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) intends to enhance China's international integration, strikingly by enhancing infrastructure and bolstering trade and investment links among the economies involved. Poor transport infrastructure and border restrictions are significant deterrents to trade expansion, economic growth, and bilateral trade. Using panel structural gravity model estimations, this study investigates the impact of Transportation infrastructure inheritances on bilateral trade across the Belt and Road member countries, particularly in Eastern Africa. The study considers the potential effect of the BRI roads, railways, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure network on the bilateral trade and economies of the Eastern African countries. The empirical analysis offers robust evidence that transport infrastructure promotes trade. The study found that transport infrastructure has a significant and positive effect on trade. These results imply that transport infrastructure exerts a strong effect on trade and growth in Eastern Africa. Policies for increasing access and affordability of transport infrastructure are highly recommended to promote trade and economic growth in the Eastern Africa sub-region.

AB  - This paper documents how extensive economic education can reduce the risk of getting into financial trouble by comparing people who enter business and economics programs with people who enter other higher education programs. To identify the causal effect, I exploit GPA admission thresholds that quasi-randomize applicants near the thresholds into different higher education programs. I find that admission to an economics program reduces the probability of loan default and delinquency by one half. This large reduction is associated with changes in financial behavior, but it is not associated with differences in the level or stability of people's income.

TI  - Acceptance of the metaverse: a laboratory experiment on augmented and virtual reality shopping
T2  - INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeIn recent years, there has been significant interest in adopting XR (extended reality) technologies such as VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality), particularly in retail. However, extending activities through reality-mediation is still mostly believed to offer an inferior experience due to their shortcomings in usability, wearability, graphical fidelity, etc. This study aims to address the research gap by experimentally examining the acceptance of metaverse shopping.Design/methodology/approachThis study conducts a 2 (VR: with vs. without) x 2 (AR: with vs. without) between-subjects laboratory experiment involving 157 participants in simulated daily shopping environments. This study builds a physical brick-and-mortar store at the campus and stocked it with approximately 600 products with accompanying product information and pricing. The XR devices and a 3D laser scanner were used in constructing the three XR shopping conditions.FindingsResults indicate that XR can offer an experience comparable to, or even surpassing, traditional shopping in terms of its instrumental and hedonic aspects, regardless of a slightly reduced perception of usability. AR negatively affected perceived ease of use, while VR significantly increased perceived enjoyment. It is surprising that the lower perceived ease of use appeared to be disconnected from the attitude toward metaverse shopping.Originality/valueThis study provides important experimental evidence on the acceptance of XR shopping, and the finding that low perceived ease of use may not always be detrimental adds to the theory of technology adoption as a whole. Additionally, it provides an important reference point for future randomized controlled studies exploring the effects of technology on adoption.

TI  - Inequality in the golden years: Wealth gradients in disability-free and work-free longevity in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS
AB  - We study the relationship of wealth with the "quality"of longevity as measured by years after age 65 containing disability or work. By comparing cohorts turning 65 in 1996 and 2006, we observe strong within-cohort gradients of wealth in which the more wealthy live more years disability-free and work more years, yet also experience more work-free years. We document that these gradients steepened over the decade we study. We explore robustness using education as an alternative indicator for socioeconomic status, and rule out certain explanations for these trends by analyzing the effect of health shocks on wealth accumulation.

TI  - An investigation of time preferences, life expectancy, and annuity versus lump sum choices: Can smoking harm long-term saving decisions?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - We exploit the fact that Israeli pension insurance policies do not take health conditions or smoking status into account in annuity pricing to investigate the potential effect of being a smoker on retirement payout choices. Contrary to the idea that smokers have higher discount rates (and thus should prefer the lump sum option), and even though the insurance pricing mechanism means that smokers would be offered the same annuity as nonsmokers (all else equal), we find that smokers do not prefer the lump sum option. We offer and test several potential explanations for our findings: illusions regarding life expectancy, self-control, and advantageous selection. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sources of Inaction in Household Finance: Evidence from the Danish Mortgage Markets
T2  - AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - We build an empirical model to attribute delays in mortgage refinancing to psychological costs inhibiting refinancing until incentives are sufficiently strong; and behavior, potentially attributable to information-gathering costs, lowering the probability of household refinancing per unit time at any incentive. We estimate the model on administrative panel data from Denmark, where mortgage refinancing without cash-out is unconstrained. Middle-aged and wealthy households act as if they have high psychological refinancing costs; but older, poorer, and less-educated households refinance with lower probability irrespective of incentives, thereby achieving lower savings. We use the model to understand frictions in the mortgage channel of monetary policy transmission.
