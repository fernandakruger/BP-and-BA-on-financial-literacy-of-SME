AB  - The purpose of the study is to evaluate the knowledge level and behavior that business school students from Veracruz, Mexico have in relation to interest rates, inflation, savings, credit and budgeting. For the empirical study, a non-experimental quantitative cross-sectioned and descriptive design was followed. The test used was that of Moreno-García et al. (2017), which was answered by 309 undergraduate students from Veracruz, Mexico. Data measurement was performed using descriptive statistics, cross tables and the non-parametric test of proportions (Z). The main findings point to the fact that more students understand well the impact of inflation than the relationship between interest rates and bonds; that students do not consider that saving provides financial security; and that there is no gender difference in terms of saving behavior. Most of the business school students do not have a credit card, prefer debit cards and have acceptable practices in budget planning. In summary, the results of this study show a good level of financial knowledge in relation to interest rates, inflation, investment, credit, and show adequate behavior of savings and credit card, as well as the use of the budgets. However, it was expected that each item would have a greater number of correct answers, considering that the population under study has received training in mathematics, economics, and finance. It is noteworthy that, in relation to gender, there are more men who correctly answer the questions about inflation and it is women who have better practices in the use of their credit cards © 2022 by Cherkas Global University All rights reserved

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this research is to develop a multidimensional measurement of fashion domain entrepreneurial self-efficacy (FDESE) based on which fashion entrepreneurs will be able to better develop strategies to gain and sustain success in their business development. The research is crucial to advocate fashion entrepreneurship and will provide direction for fashion business incubation services. Design/methodology/approach: This research included three stages with mixed qualitative and quantitative approaches: conceptualizing construct definition and specifying domain(s) to generate initial items, scale purification and scale validation. This study started with reviewing the literature and individual interviews among 19 fashion entrepreneurs, which generated 72 initial items. An online survey was then conducted with individuals who are running or have the intention to run fashion businesses, yielding 249 useable samples for scale purification, which generated 21 items for the validation phase. Lastly, another online survey was administered to individuals who are currently running fashion businesses which resulted in 258 valid responses included for scale validation. Findings: A measure of FDESE that is both reliable and valid was developed, including 21 items across four distinct dimensions: passion for fashion business (five items), marketing and branding (seven items), financial management (five items) and creativity (four items). Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to develop practical scales measuring self-efficacy that focus on fashion domain entrepreneurship. The newly developed FDESE scale indicates that entrepreneurship not only involves marketing skills, financial knowledge, creativity, leadership, and proactivity but also requires passion and persistence. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The paper analyzes the effect of financial, knowledge, demand, market structure and regulation barriers to innovation on firms’ economic performance. It contributes to the literature on barriers to innovation by accounting for the heterogeneous effects that each barrier has on firms across the productivity distribution. We do so by employing both quantile regression techniques and matching estimators on this UK CIS panel 2002–2010 merged with the Business Structure Database. While we find evidence that both the cost and also the availability of finance negatively affect productivity across the whole distribution, the lack of qualified personnel mostly hinders high productivity firms. Moreover, quantile regression reveals some interesting variation in effect sizes across the (conditional) productivity distribution. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study aimed to clarify the mediating role of strategic foresight in its various forms (foresight, acumen, research) in the relationship between financial knowledge and strategic response in its dimensions (resource liquidity, business maturity, reactiveness and reactivity). To achieve this goal, this study was based on the descriptive analytical method, where the questionnaire was used to collect the primary data. (220) questionnaires were distributed to workers in the branches of commercial banks in the middle Euphrates cities (40) branches and (215) were retrieved from them. The results revealed that the adoption of financial knowledge enabled the organization, the study sample, to respond effectively to environmental dynamics through strategic foresight. Moreover, it was revealed that organizations that used financial knowledge were able to maximize their core competencies through strategic foresight, and thus provided added value to services efficiently over their competitors. © 2021

AB  - Personal financial literacy (PFL) is an imperative life skill that all 21st-century students should have. Research shows that the levels of financial literacy in both developing and developed countries are very low across people of all ages. This deplorable state of affairs has negative implications on the well-being of the populace, as evidenced by increased indebtedness, lower saving, poor planning for retirement, and the making of many poor personal financial decisions. Recognizing the potential benefits of financial literacy at both individual and national levels, many countries have started to offer financial education in their schools. This article analyzed the business subjects’ curriculum at secondary school level in Botswana and literature published on the subject of PFL, and found that there exists a gap in this area and a need to offer PFL to all learners in the school system. Despite the need for such a move, Botswana does not have a deliberate program in its curriculum that specifically addresses this problem. This article discusses the benefits of personal financial education, the inadequacy of current business subjects to meet this need, and concludes by recommending a mandatory PFL subject in the Botswana secondary school curriculum. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The present study develops a tool to measure financial literacy in the era of the post-COVID-19 pandemic while recognizing the challenges and changes posed by the pandemic. Investigating and validating it in the Arab context that lacked such measurement and a dire need for further exploration. It employed new financial concepts that emerged during and post-COVID-19 (e.g., e-wallet, emergency funds), besides adjusting some items from previous instruments (e.g., Yanto et al., 2021; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2019). An electronic questionnaire was distributed among Jordanian universities students. 507 valid responses were retained. Of the sample, females, employed students, bachelor’s degrees, and business and social science majors represent 51.7 percent, 36 percent, 78.5 percent, and 36.3 percent, respectively. A quantitative approach was conducted using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) via AMOS-SEM to validate the robustness of the model. The findings revealed that the EFA demonstrated 11 items with three factors retained for measuring financial literacy (FL) (knowledge, practice, and skills) agree with (Baistaman et al., 2020). Based on the CFA result, the model fits the indexes (CMIN/DF = 2.369, CFI = 0.985, GFI = 0.966, RMSEA = 0.052). Th developed tool is approved in its context, and it would assist policymakers in obtaining information necessary to enhance government strategies, namely, the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. © 2024 The Author.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this research was first to determine the competencies mandatory of risk managers, and second, to consider the implications of such competencies in determining modules appropriate for inclusion in any prospective undergraduate qualification with specialisation in risk management. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research approach was followed, involving academics teaching risk management in a focus group and making use of interactive qualitative analysis (IQA). Findings: The competencies identified were business management skills, financial knowledge, an understanding of the risk management process, governance and compliance, people management and technical skills. These will be explained in greater detail in the paper. Research limitations/implications: The implications for teaching are that an undergraduate curriculum in risk management will have to combine majors such as business management, financial management, risk management, industrial psychology and communication. These majors need to be complemented by modules in governance and compliance management, as well as information and communication technology. Practical implications: The implication for practice is that risk management professionals and members of the Institute of Risk Management of South Africa need to avail themselves to serve on an advisory board of academic departments offering risk management qualifications. Risk management is a developing science and requires inputs about research and the curriculation of qualifications. Social implications: The implication for public policy is that the South African Qualifications Authority and the Council for Higher Education should reconsider their requirements for designators (specialised qualifications). The implications for research are that IQA provides clarity on the knowledge and skills required to develop a competency-based qualification in risk management. Further research should benchmark qualifications and propose a curriculum for a bachelor’s degree in risk management. Originality/value: The use of IQA is a novel way of ensuring rigour and objectivity in arriving at a description of the required knowledge, skills, values and attributes of risk managers. This paper will assist in the compilation of a new curriculum for an undergraduate qualification in risk management; thus, ensuring such qualification will provide a competency-based qualification that will meet the needs of the profession. © 2022, Johan Marx and Cecilia Jacoba de Swardt.

AB  - The objective of this article was to analyze the factors that determine the level of financial literacy in Mexican adults, the method used for the analysis was an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model. The results reveal that age, marital status, education, number of dependents and income level in the central and southern regions were positively associated with the financial literacy index; while men and having a job were negatively associated. One of the limitations of the study lies in the number of observations regarding some variables considered. The originality of the work consists in the fact that evidence is provided considering the characteristics at the individual level for Mexico. The findings obtained can be useful for the design of public policies as well as serve as a basis for subsequent studies. Objective: The objective of conducting an investigation into the literality of financing may be to fully understand the specific provisions and clauses of financial contracts. This may include analyzing the terms and conditions set forth in loan agreements, lines of credit or other forms of financing to fully understand the obligations and responsibilities of the parties involved. Theoretical Framework: Various proposals have been developed to measure financial literacy/inclusion (BANAMEX, 2018; Dabla-Norris et al., 2015; OECD, 2018) however, in this work the methodology developed by OECD (2018) is used, said methodology can be adapted to the situation of each country. The ENIF 2018 incorporates questions that cover aspects of financial knowledge, behaviors and attitudes in adults from 18 to 70 years of age, where the maximum score obtained is seven, nine and five points for each aspect respectively, which gives a total of 21 points. The index is built from the sum of the points obtained in each aspect. Method: This sum is normalized to 100 to facilitate its interpretation (CNBV, 2019); a higher value implies greater financial literacy and a lower value the opposite. Context of financial education in Mexico The CNBV (2019) indicates that the financial literacy index for Mexico was located at a rating of 58.2 points; when broken down by components, it indicates that "financial knowledge" was located at 65.8 and Results and conclusion: Current Level of Financial Literacy: The level of financial literacy in Mexico has been determined to be relatively low, with a large proportion of the population lacking basic knowledge of financial issues. Impact on Financial Well-being: It has been shown that there is a direct correlation between the level of financial literacy and the economic well-being of individuals, highlighting the importance of improving education in this area to boost financial development and reduce economic insecurity. Demographic Gaps: Certain demographic groups, such as low-income people, youth and women, have been identified as facing greater challenges in terms of financial literacy, underscoring the need to adopt inclusive and targeted approaches to address these disparities. Importance of Financial Education: The relevance of promoting financial education programs from the early stages of life has been highlighted, both in the educational system and through community initiatives, to equip people with the necessary skills to make responsible financial decisions. and prepare them to face future economic challenges. Resarch implications: Awareness of the Importance of the Topic: Conducting research on financial literacy involves recognizing the critical relevance of this topic in today's society. This means understanding how a lack of financial literacy can negatively impact the lives of individuals and communities in terms of economic well-being, access to opportunities, and the ability to make informed decisions. Understanding the Causes and Consequences: The researcher must delve into the underlying causes of the lack of financial literacy, as well as the possible short- and long-term consequences for individuals and society as a whole. This involves analyzing factors such as access to financial education, the quality of the education received, socioeconomic and cultural barriers, among others. Identification of Areas of Improvement: Research can reveal specific areas where improvements are needed in terms of public policies, educational programs, financial services, and business practices. This may include recommendations to develop stronger school curricula, implement financial awareness campaigns, improve the accessibility of financial services, and promote transparency and accountability in the financial industry. Developing Innovative Solutions: By understanding the needs and challenges related to financial literacy, researchers can contribute to the development of innovative and effective solutions. This could involve creating interactive educational tools, designing training programs tailored to different demographic groups, or implementing financial technologies (fintech) that facilitate access to financial services and making informed decisions. Fostering Dialogue and Collaboration: Research can serve as a basis to foster dialogue between different actors, including government institutions, nonprofit organizations, private companies, academics, and civil society. This can lead to strategic collaborations and coordinated actions to address financial literacy challenges more effectively and sustainably.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate consumers’ cryptocurrency adoption through the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and complexity theory. Design/methodology/approach: By using a purposive sampling method, a configurational model was developed and a questionnaire-based survey was conducted to gather responses from a Malaysian sample. A total of 223 responses were obtained. Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) were adopted to analyze the data. Findings: The PLS-SEM indicated that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and affinity for technology interaction were positive cryptocurrency adoption predictors, whereas regulation was a negative predictor. Based on the fsQCA, cryptocurrency adoption could be explained by six configurational paths, which comprised combinations of the proposed causal conditions: the UTAUT factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating condition and social influence), environmental factor (regulation) and individual factors (financial knowledge and affinity for technology interaction). Research limitations/implications: This study offers contributions to the theoretical body of knowledge by articulating the relevance of extended UTAUT and extending the established UTAUT model by integrating external environment and personal factors, also showing the linear and nonlinear interplays of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, regulation, financial knowledge and affinity for technology interaction. Practical implications: The findings facilitated practitioners’ (cryptocurrency brokers, governments and businesses) fostering of cryptocurrency adoption through the joint consideration of different factors. The factors spanned technological attributes and individual characteristics to regulation. Practitioners should acknowledge that different combinations of the aforementioned antecedents can be equally effective to increase cryptocurrency adoption. The findings suggested that these causal conditions should be considered holistically and that there is no best predictor. Social implications: In social terms, the research is expected to contribute to the dissemination of cryptocurrencies and help governments and central banks to develop, regulate and supervise digital currencies, as well as in the implementation of a digital currency ecosystem aligned with sustainable development goals. Economically, the results might foster a high cryptocurrency adoption rate and stimulate crypto-token-based business models and investment opportunities that present new means of revenue generation at individual, organizational and national levels. Originality/value: This study offers unique perspectives for the body of knowledge and practice in the cryptocurrency domain, using both symmetric and asymmetric methodologies, by delineating the configurational logic involving technological capabilities, social influences, regulation and individual characteristics in facilitating more efficacious dissemination of cryptocurrencies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the level of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) business owners–managers’ financial literacy and its impact on firm’s performance. The article applied a random sample and structural equation modelling (SEM) approaches in assessing the influence of SME business owners–managers’ level of financial literacy within the three states in the southwest Nigeria. The findings show the complete effect of business owner–manager’s financial knowledge, financial awareness and financial attitude in converting financial literacy to increase in firm performance. Also, they confirm that financial knowledge and awareness of SME business owners–managers are obviously not a prerequisite for the performance of SMEs, but entrepreneur characteristics in decision-making and relationship to financial attitude have a comparison with financial literacy. The research limitation evolves from cross section information observation that solely covers the southwestern part of the country. Additionally, inspired to meet the analysis gap is panel data analysis. Training courses through strategic orientation on the attitudinal perception of SME business owner–manager and basic business management skills, capacity-building aspect, leadership development as well as networking via relationship marketing and management on financial literacy may have significant effect on SMEs’ performance and growth for the managers in general in Nigeria. The article is one of the first to examine the level of financial literacy of SME business owners–managers in Nigeria. The article therefore sets an important benchmark for further research in this area. © 2017, © 2017 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

AB  - Purpose: The rich financial knowledge of small and micro business owners helps to enhance the formal credit demand of small and micro enterprises and change the credit channel preference of small and micro enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between financial knowledge and the credit practices of 290 small and micro enterprises in China’s Jiangsu and Shandong provinces based on their formal credit needs and preferred channels of credit. Design/methodology/approach: To measure the degree of the credit constraints of small and micro enterprises, this study applied questionnaire surveys to obtain information on the credit demand and supply of 363 small and micro enterprises in the Jiangsu and Shandong provinces. Firstly, a probit model is used to study the influence of financial knowledge on the formal credit demand and credit acquisition possibility of small and micro enterprises, and tool variables and a biprobit model are used to deal with the possible errors of endogenesis and sample selection. Secondly, a tobit model is used to study the influence of financial knowledge on the credit access of small and micro enterprises in different channels, and tool variables and a Heckman two-stage model are used to deal with endogenesis and possible errors in sample selection. Finally, this study carried out a series of robustness tests to make the conclusions more reliable. Findings: This study is based on the perspective of the knowledge-based view to explore the impact of financial knowledge on the credit behaviour of small and micro enterprises. This study found that financial knowledge can increase a small and micro enterprise’s formal credit needs and drive the small and micro enterprise to actively apply for loans. Furthermore, financial knowledge has a significant and positive influence on the acquisition of formal credit and approved lines of formal credit and a significant and negative influence on the acquisition of informal credit and approved lines of informal credit. Research limitations/implications: The results indicated that increased financial knowledge can increase the likelihood of a small and micro enterprise to prefer formal credit and reduce the likelihood of it to prefer informal credit channels. Originality/value: Financial knowledge is the ability to master basic economic knowledge and financial concepts as well as the ability to use knowledge to manage and allocate financial resources. The rich financial knowledge of small and micro business owners helps to enhance the formal credit demand of small and micro enterprises and change their credit channel preference. This paper offers a new perspective on the problems of credit constraint, low participation in formal credit markets and high participation in private credit markets among China’s small and micro enterprises and valuably supplements the research literature. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Using a representative survey of Dutch entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals, (i) we measure their subjective financial knowledge and the extent to which they ask for advice when managing their companies, and (ii) we examine whether subjective financial knowledge and the demand for advice are related to the firm economic performance. We find that the respondents feel more comfortable with accounting subjects than they do with strategic ones, of which they feel that they know the least. Entrepreneurs with a greater extent of financial knowledge are more likely to report a higher gross margin and higher revenue growth for their firm. These entrepreneurs are also less likely to seek advice and to delegate financial decisions. Seeking professional advice does not increase the likelihood of an entrepreneur having better performance. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs’ degree of financial knowledge is related to the success of their businesses, while seeking advice is not significantly correlated with better firm performance. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study intends to handle the latter gap: different results of the determinants of financial inclusion, i.e., financial literacy, age, income, and education. Furthermore, it applies the quantitative design, examining the statistical hypotheses. Additionally, the snowball sampling method chose the population of female entrepreneurs in Indonesia. Through the survey in 2022, this study effectively obtained one hundred and fifty-two samples and their responses. Furthermore, the logistic regression model and classification matrix analyze the obtained data. According to this study’s measurements of access, savings, and credit accounts (AA, SA, and CA), financial literacy effectively increases the financial inclusion of female entrepreneurs. At the same time, demographic features, i.e., age, income, and education, have a positive effect on these accounts. The classification accuracy of financial literacy towards AA, SA, and CA is 94.1%, 80.3%, and 95.4%, respectively. For age, the accuracy is 72.4% for AA, 81.6% for SA, and 67.1% for CA. For income, the accuracy is 89.5% for AA, 85.5% for SA, and 96.1% for CA. For education, the accuracy is 88.2% for AA, 78.3% for SA, and 94.7% for CA. Considering this evidence, businesswomen must have the financial knowledge to choose access, savings, and credit accounts to sustain and grow their business scope. For this purpose, central and local government support is still vital to assist them. © 2024 Conscientia Beam. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Digital financial literacy is projected to become an increasingly significant part of education in the digital age, both in India and around the world. To create programs to raise the level of financial literacy among people in the digital age, it is essential to measure the level of digital financial literacy among various societal segments. The study aims to provide a validated tool for measuring the digital financial literacy of individuals in developing countries, like India and also to analyze the significance of its key dimensions. Also, the level of DFL among respondents in the National Capital Territory (India) was measured. The study adopted the widely used scale development paradigm provided by Churchill (1979). The empirical data was collected using two online surveys with 145 (N1) and 323 (N2) sample sizes, which were analyzed with factor analysis using International Business Machines (IBM) Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and IBM SPSS Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) statistical software. The proposed digital financial literacy scale consists of twenty-two statements under five key aspects of digital financial literacy, which are: Digital Financial Risk and Control; Basic Digital Financial Knowledge; Advanced Digital Financial Knowledge; Digital Financial Attitude, and Digital Financial Behavior. The proposed Digital Financial Literacy Scale demonstrated sound psychometric properties, encouraging its future usage for assessing the digital financial literacy of individuals. Furthermore, it can help organizations and concerned authorities compare individuals' digital financial literacy levels pre- and post-implementation of Digital Financial Literacy Awareness campaigns. © 2024 Sociedade Portguesa de Estomatologia e Medicina Dentaria.

AB  - Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is the dispersal and optimisation of resource packages like human, financial, knowledge, physical and reputational resources. The motivational factors such as natural resources, market resources, strategic resources, efficiency resources, locational advantages, etc., influenced Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) to perform various activities in the host countries. MNEs internationalise business mainly to acquire intangible assets and for balancing resources which they do not possess. India is in receipt of continuous capital flow due to favourable policy management and a strong business environment. Globally, Indian corporations continually display significantly better equity earnings over other countries both developed and emerging. The Government of India is very keen in simplifying FDI rules with an ultimate aim to attract more investors with zero hazards. Copyright © 2018, IGI Global.

AB  - With the widespread application of new technologies in the financial field, many new service models or companies have emerged in China. These new companies have transformed traditional financial service companies and have had a huge impact on the financial industry. Internet finance companies use mobile Internet, cloud computing, big data and other technologies to vigorously expand the fields of payment, lending, investment, asset management and other fields, and continue to expand applications and business fields, which has caused a lot of shock to the traditional financial sector. The purpose of this paper is to study the construction of a credit knowledge service model in the financial field based on the integrated SVM data stream classification algorithm. This paper establishes the construction of a credit knowledge service model in the financial field based on the integrated SVM data stream classification algorithm, and analyzes the specific content of the credit knowledge service in the financial field in detail. According to the experimental research in this article, the accuracy of financial data retrieval based on the integrated SVM data stream classification algorithm proposed in this article is very high. When the search result of the EASR algorithm of the flow classification algorithm is different from the detection result of the engine’s own algorithm, the accuracy of the EASR algorithm is higher, reaching about 92.2%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - We organise a field experiment with smallholder farmers in Rwanda to measure the impact of financial literacy training on financial knowledge and behaviour. The training increased financial literacy of participants, changed their savings and borrowing behaviour and had a positive effect on the new business start-up. However, it failed to have a significant (short-term) impact on income. Using a two-stage regression framework, we identify enhanced financial literacy as one of the important factors explaining behavioural changes. We also test whether financial knowledge spillovers from trained farmers to their peers in local village banks but find no evidence for that. © 2014 Royal Economic Society

AB  - Purpose: Financial literacy is generally seen as an important factor explaining a broader set of investment behaviors. In the context of a weak financial knowledge in France, this article focuses on the particular situation of Generation Z (individuals born after 1995) and more particularly management students likely to be involved in financial decisions in the near future. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a survey conducted in the Fall of 2019, through a questionnaire distributed to 300 students enrolled in a French business school. Findings: The results indicate that financial knowledge is poor for students who do not follow a specialized course in finance. This research also demonstrates the importance of risk behavior, showing that risk adverse students are also those with the lowest level of financial literacy. Originality/value: This article contributes to the academic literature by focusing on students in France. It is the first study to examine Gen Z financial literacy and its implications. It raises awareness on the importance of financial education in the education curriculum. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Using a novel large database of Italian micro-entrepreneurs, we investigate how different sources of external business advice affect access to alternative finance. We distinguish three categories of external business advice: professional financial, professional non-financial, and non-professional. We also test whether financial knowledge of micro-entrepreneurs enhances their advice seeking for financial decision-making. We find that the use of alternative financial instruments increases when external business advisors are used, but some are more useful than others. Only professional financial advice is shown to increase the probability of accessing alternative finance by micro-enterprises, while non-professional and professional non-financial advice does not have the same effect. We also find that being more financially literate increases the probability that micro-entrepreneurs seek advice from highly professional sources, i.e., objective financial knowledge helps shape the quality of financial advice requested. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The study examines the influence of the five pillars of inclusive financing on the empowerment of micro-, smalland medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and the influence of institutional conditions on the empowerment of MSMEs. This study uses primary and secondary data. The population of the study are MSMEs; the is a total of 930,620 MSMEs in Jakarta. Owners of micro-, smalland medium-sized enterprises is a good population to be measured because they are the main actors that know exactly the challenges and the obstacles in doing business addressing problems faced in inclusive financing, which is related to the purpose of the study. The research borrows from finance and entrepreneurial theories for model design. The results of the study show that all the variables are significant and positive in the efforts to finance MSMEs in Indonesia, which means that financial education plays an important role in the sustainability of financial inclusion. The financial theory, developed to explain financing at the company level, needs to be adapted to the entrepreneurial situation, so that it can explain the behavior of small businesses. This means that, with correct financial knowledge, financial inclusion plays an important role in the sustainability of MSMEs in Indonesia. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

AB  - Financial named entity recognition (FinNER) is a challenging task in the field of financial text information extraction, which aims to extract a large amount of financial knowledge from unstructured texts. It is widely accepted to use the sequence tagging framework to implement the FinNER tasks. However, such sequence tagging models cannot fully take advantage of the semantic information in the texts. Instead, we formulate the FinNER task as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem and propose a new model termed FinBERT–MRC. This formulation introduces significant prior information by utilizing well-designed queries, and extracts the start index and end index of the target entities without decoding modules such as conditional random fields (CRFs). We conduct experiments on a publicly available Chinese financial dataset ChFinAnn and a real-world business dataset AdminPunish. FinBERT–MRC achieves average F1 scores of 92.78% and 96.80% on two datasets, respectively, with average F1 gains + 3.75% and + 0.68% over some sequence tagging models including BiLSTM–CRF, BiGRU–CRF, BiLSTM–CNN–CRF, FinBERT–Tagger, and FinBERT–CRF.

AB  - Background.: Business simulation games have been used since 1979 at the University of Pécs. Since 2000, two games have been taught: a green business simulation developed on site and known as BUSINESS SIMULATION CHALLENGE and the MULTINATIONAL MANAGEMENT GAME. In this research we report on a longitudinal study of the results of the two business simulations; and investigate the effects of the Green Business simulation. Method.: This survey-based research included 329 students that completed a questionnaire on business simulations since 2000. Surveys were carried out to measure the effect of the two simulations. There are data from three periods up to recent years. Frequency tables, univariate ANCOVA, T-tests and cross-tabulation were used to analyse the data. Generations’ attitudes and skills do not change with the passage of time, and the skills and knowledge, conveyed by the simulations can be considered as constant throughout the period. This study confirms that main managerial skills are developed with simulation games but there is no need for enhanced mathematical and financial knowledge. The green simulation successfully developed the green attitude of students, but only in cases where the green option was rational. More educated students enjoy greater challenges, namely the need for deeper analysis. Simulation courses in universities provide a higher level of motivation than do commercial simulations. Conclusion.: Results.: It can be stated that almost the same results can be achieved by general purpose simulations which have a different focus (analytical or strategy-oriented game). Results also indicate that more simulation courses in universities would stimulate higher student motivation. © 2020 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Purpose: Enterprises are increasingly taking actionable steps to transform existing business models through digital technologies for service transformation such as big data analytics (BDA). BDA capabilities offer financial institutions to source financial data, analyse data, insight and store such data and information on collaborative platforms for a quick decision-making process. Accordingly, this study identifies how BDA capabilities can be deployed to provide significant improvement for financial services agility. Design/methodology/approach: The study relied on survey data from 485 banking professionals' perspectives with BDA usage, IT capability development and financial service agility. The PLS-SEM technique was used to evaluate the underlying relationship and the applicability of the research framework proposed. Findings: Based on the empirical test from this study, distinctive BDA usage grounded on the concept of IT capability viewpoint proof that financial service agility could be enhanced provided enterprises develop technical capabilities alongside other relevant resources. Practical implications: The study further highlights the need for financial service managers to identify BDA technologies such as data mining, query and reporting, data visualisation, predictive modelling, streaming analytics, video analytics and voice analytics to focus on financial knowledge gathering and market observation. Financial managers can also deploy BDA tools to develop a strategic road map for data management, data transferability and knowledge discovery for customised financial products. Originality/value: This study is a useful contribution to the burgeoning discussion with emerging technologies such as BDA implication to improving enterprises operations. © 2021, Abeeku Sam Sam Edu.

AB  - Thailand has now become the aging society. However, the fact that the majority of Thai wageworkers do not effectively save for their retirement may result in several elderly living below the poverty threshold during retirement. The objectives of this research article were to find the factors determining Thai wageworkers’ retirement contribution. Founded on the theory of life-cycle hypothesis, this article employed a sample of 300 wageworkers in the Northeast of Thailand and performed a statistical analysis using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach using age as a moderator. The empirical results revealed that expected income, wealth accumulation, career status, and health status were the main constructs influencing an individual’s ability to contribute to his or her retirement. This article suggested that a wageworker should first contribute his or her income through wealth accumulation schemes such as investment in financial assets, for example, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and properties, investment in other business as a second job, and simply cash deposit. The results suggested that wealth accumulation was the most important mediator allowing a wageworker to contribute to retirement effectively in the long term. This article also proposed thoughtful research implications for wageworkers, employers, and the Thai government. This article recommended that the government and authorized bodies (e.g., the Bank of Thailand and the Stock Exchange of Thailand) should provide more investment alternatives and improve investment knowledge of the citizens. This would allow the citizens to have sufficient financial knowledge to invest in riskier financial instruments that potentially give better returns such as stocks. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Purpose: The main purpose of this study is to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected from the poor who resides in rural Uganda. Structural equation modelling (SEM) through analysis of moment structures (AMOS) was used to analyze the data. Bootstrap approach with 5,000 samples was run to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Findings: The results showed that social network significantly and positively mediate the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. In addition, financial literacy also has a direct significant and positive effect on financial inclusion. Overall, the findings suggest that the presence of social network fully mediate the effect of financial literacy on financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Research limitations/implications: This study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Future studies could adopt longitudinal research design to establish the dynamic characteristics of the samples under study over time. Besides, this study collected data from only poor households who were clients of microfinance banks located in rural Uganda. It ignored the other section of the population who were not the poor. Therefore, future studies could use the other section of the population who are clients of commercial banks. Practical implications: The advocates of financial literacy and managers of microfinance banks in developing countries should ensure using existing local structures such as community and village associations to conduct financial literacy training. The village associations help in mobilizing members who are close-knit based on the existing societal ties that can be used as a channel for disseminating vital financial literacy information. Indeed, financial literacy workshops, seminars, and business clinics can be easily conducted to individuals who are members of the village associations. Originality/value: This paper integrates social network theory in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Social network acts as a conduit through which financial knowledge and skills flow to increase the scope of financial inclusion of the poor in developing countries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being among businesspersons in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, México. The applied methodology includes confirmatory factor analysis and multiple linear regression models. Our results indicate that financial literacy is related to financial well-being directly through its financial behavior component and inversely through financial attitude. Moreover, financial knowledge was not significantly associated with it. Hence, we propose the following recommendations for businesspeople and entrepreneurs: becoming more involved in healthy financial inclusion and financial literacy practices and inspiring their transition from models focused solely on profits to others considering their self-realization and satisfaction. Its main limitations and implications are the scarcity of data to perform an analysis by industry, its geographical outreach, and its public policy repercussions. Its originality lies in analyzing financial well-being among businesspeople, a topic rarely studied in Mexico. Our conclusions impact the implementation of the financial inclusion policy in Mexico and, therefore, contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas.

AB  - The study investigates how financial literacy and financial capabilities influence small firms’ sustainability in Lagos and Ogun States, Nigeria. It employs a survey research design to collect data from 300 small business owners across the two States. Data collected were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique. The study shows that environmental sustainability, financial sustainability and social responsibility are significant determinants of small firms’ sustainability in Nigeria. Financial literacy and financial capabilities practices also have a significant positive impact on firm sustainability. However, the use of savings product shows a significant adverse effect on firms’ sustainability. The findings imply that financial literacy knowledge and practice in small business operations enhance firms’ sustainability. The study recommends that small firms should incorporate sustainability models into their business operations and improve their financial knowledge to maintain sustainability. Small business owners should also invest their savings in an appropriate investment product that suits their risk tolerance. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an upsurge in stock market investment intentions. Researchers are therefore becoming more and more eager to look into the factors that influence investors in general, and individual investors in particular to engage in stock market activities. Under the assumption of the theory of planned behavior this study looked at investor's intentions to invest in the stock market. The study primarily focusses on the impact of financial knowledge, personality traits, subjective norms, attitude, and financial self-efficacy on the stock market investment intentions of individual investors. To gather information from individual investors, the study used a cross-sectional research approach, on the population sample of 298 individuals. The data is collected from the Pakistani investors, from three big cities, i.e. Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, also considered as business centers of the country. The respondents include both the salaried workers and business owners. The findings indicate that attitude and financial self-efficacy were significant mediators for investors’ investment decisions. The results imply that people with a favorable outlook on investing in the stock market, risk-taking and innovative personalities, and financial expertise are more likely make investments. Those who have a mindset towards investing and financial self-efficacy also have more intentions. © 2024, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research aims to investigate the role of financial self-efficacy in mediating the relationship between entrepreneurial education and venture capital intention, as well as the moderating influence of government support on the relationship between financial self-efficacy and venture capital intention. The target population consists of Lahore students from public and private universities who have already studied entrepreneurship. Based on the 250 responses to the online survey the findings show the mediating role of financial self-efficacy between entrepreneurial education and intention toward venture capital. Moreover, it also indicates the moderated effect of government support on the relationship between financial self-efficacy and intention toward venture capital. This study will not only help the curriculum committees in business schools to design entrepreneurial education outlines that enable the students to explore the different financing modes by including financial knowledge to cope with financial challenges but also to the government officials in devising financing plans accompanied by their expertise in the development of a business.

AB  - Students of the millennial generation have several characteristics, including being wasteful in their management of money and being highly dependent on information and communication technology. These phenomena mean financial literacy is important for them, in order that they become capable, wise, and efficient individuals who are future-oriented in managing their personal finances. This study aims to create a model for developing the financial management behavior of students. It covers five variables, namely financial behavior, financial attitude, financial knowledge, social media exposure, and peer influence. By using purposive sampling and a five-point Likert scale questionnaire, this study collected data from 327 students spread across several universities in Indonesia. The results of the descriptive analysis show that the students’ financial management behavior (FMB), financial attitude, and financial knowledge are classified as good. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis using the single-composite indicator technique shows that 58% of FMB is influenced by financial exposure from social media, financial attitude, and peer influence. Social media exposure and peer influence take on a strategic nature. Financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial behavior are internal variables related to financial literacy. Further research would need to identify the external variables that have a potential influence on the internal variables of financial literacy. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This research aimed to explore how well managers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Mogadishu, Somalia, understand financial concepts such as savings, managing debt, handling financial risks, and planning for retirement, and how this understanding affects their investment decisions. The background of the study highlights that many SMEs in Mogadishu struggle to sustain their operations, with low profits or failure often due to poor investment choices. To investigate the link between financial literacy and investment decision-making among these managers, the study was based on the principles of modern portfolio theory. The research used a correlational design to analyze data from 250 targeted SMEs, with 154 respondents selected through stratified random sampling. Data collection was facilitated by questionnaires, and the analysis involved calculating means, standard deviations, and conducting regression analysis. The findings indicated that among the financial literacy components, debt management had the most significant impact on investment decisions (β=0.490, p<0.05), followed by financial risk management (β=0.137, p<0.05), and lastly, the ability to save (β=0.128, p<0.05). The study concluded that financial literacy plays a crucial role in influencing investment decisions among SME managers in Mogadishu, suggesting that improving financial knowledge could lead to better business outcomes. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The main purpose of this research is the estimation and analysis of the level of Financial Literacy of professionals oriented to business management. The sample was composed of young executives starting MBA studies. The level of FL was analyzed in detail through various statistical techniques, under two perspectives. The first perspective referred to the dimensions involved in the definition of FL and the second referred to the demographic characteristics of the population. Theresults show a level of FL that does not reach an acceptable minimum in its global measurement; neither in its different dimensions, but the Information dimension. In general terms, this result is reproduced at the different demographic segments analyzed. In terms of the demographic categories, there were no differences in age or gender. Based on the income level, there were differences in the Knowledge and Information dimensions. Likewise, based on the number of dependents and on profession, there were differences in the Consciousness dimension. The results allow us to make two important conjectures for further research: the Financial Duality and the Financial Divergence conjectures. It is postulated that the Financial Duality conjecture could be explained through Kahneman’s theory of System 1/System 2 and corresponding behavioral biases. © 2023 by Cherkas Global University All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aims to investigate the effects of sector 4.0 technologies, particularly Financial Technology (Fintech), on Sustainable Business Success (SBS) within the Indian garment sector. It aims to analyse the impact of Fintech Integration (IF) and Extent of Financial Knowledge (EFK) on sustainability performance, with a focus on understanding the mediating effect of Financial Accessibility (FA) in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilizes covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) to analyse data collected from 683 enterprises in the Indian garment sector. The theoretical frameworks of Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT) and the Resource-Based View are employed to guide the research. Findings: The investigation reveals that Fintech Integration (IF) and environmental friendliness knowledge significantly impact the promotion and maintenance of sustainability within the Indian garment sector. Moreover, the study highlights the moderating influence of financial Accessibility (FA) on the associations among fintech integration, Extent of Financial Knowledge, and sustainability attainment. Furthermore, sensitivity studies demonstrate that improved financial access positively affects a firm’s sustainability performance. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature by addressing significant knowledge gaps and offering practical insights for managers and policymakers in the Ready-Made Garments (RMG) industry. It provides a comprehensive approach that integrates fintech and financial expertise to enhance credit accessibility and foster long-term viability for enterprises within the Indian garment sector. The originality lies in its holistic perspective, combining technological integration with the Extent of Financial Knowledge to drive sustainability in a specific industrial context, thus providing valuable guidance for industry stakeholders. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Numerous research studies deal with the issue of researching the impacts on credit risk determinants in the SME segment. The study of economic factors that are easier to quantify from methodological point of view, and which prevent complex evaluation of causality of interest rate risk and the discovery of various social barriers dominate. This consistent fact forms a platform in designing the research to introduce a model of dependency of effective credit risk management in the SME segment on significant social and economic factors. Empirical research was carried out in the Czech business environment in 2017 on a sample of 352 enterprises. The structural analysis modeling (SEM) was the main analytical method. The research results confirmed the fact that an effective approach to managing the SME’s credit risk is determined by a number of factors of a non-economic nature. The most important are education and family environment. These are followed by economic factors, such as a relationship with banks, financial knowledge in the area of capital and payment discipline. The multi-spectral dimension of the findings and causality also opened up a wide discussion and prepared a high-quality data research base for further deeper exploration of this issue. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Poor financial decisions are a primary cause of small firm failure. This research therefore reports on an examination of antecedents behind questionable financial borrowing practices among self-employed individuals. Poor financial decisions are proxied as the use of high-cost short-term payday loans, check-cashing services, and the like (collectively, alternative financial services, AFS). More than 20 percent of self-employed individuals in the United States reported having borrowed from AFS providers, a practice that is arguably symptomatic of the poor financial decisions that could lead to business failure. Self-employed individuals, particularly those with high levels of financial self-efficacy (an attribute important to entrepreneurship) are particularly likely to employ AFS borrowing. Overconfident individuals, including self-employed individuals, comprise a disproportionate fraction of AFS users. This work also found that financial knowledge among self-employed people is, on average, no higher than that among employees, and low financial knowledge is also associated with AFS usage. Women, even though generally less financially knowledgeable than men, are relatively less likely than men to use AFS borrowing. © 2019, © 2019 International Council for Small Business.

AB  - Background and aim: Financial literacy (or financial competence) has become an internationally relevant and highly regarded topic. Since people often lack sufficient financial competence, in many countries efforts have been made to foster formal financial education. Less attention, however, has been paid to whether informal learning using information available on the Internet can also support the development of financial competence. However, this seems to be an important question because the Internet has expanded the opportunities for informal learning. In addition, people need to acquire financial competence on their own because not every financial topic relevant in one’s lifetime is covered in formal education syllabi. Against this background, in this study we tested whether people are able to develop financial competence by learning informally using information available on the Internet. We focused on mortgage loans, as they are comparatively complex financial products. Mortgage loans have the potential to significantly influence an individual’s financial situation. In addition, society might carry the burdens of risky and uninformed decisions about mortgage loans—as the financial and real estate crisis has shown. Method: 45 students of economics and business studies in their final undergraduate year participated. They were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental group explored information about mortgage loans using the loan calculator of a German bank. The control group did not explore webpages. Before the intervention, students from both groups completed knowledge tests and self-assessed their financial knowledge and behaviour. After the intervention, students had to work on a case and to decide whether a small family should take out a mortgage loan for financing a house. The decision had to be justified. In addition, students were administered an immediate and delayed knowledge test. Results and conclusions: Students of both groups did not differ in knowledge acquisition, decision making about taking a mortgage loan and argumentation quality. However, prior knowledge can be referred to in order to explain the results. Therefore, informal learning using the Internet did not seem to be effective if people did not have sufficient prior knowledge. This result underlines, on the one hand, the necessity of financial education—be it prior to informal learning or in the course of informal learning. On the other hand, the results can be interpreted as a hint to consider how to improve informal learning activities, e.g. by supporting self-regulation or by improving information material. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Financial illiteracy could pose a significant challenge to micro-entrepreneurs. There is a pressing need to foster financial literacy;, therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine particularly how Islamic financial literacy may enhance their businesses toward achieving financial sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quantitative methods. Three hundred (300) questionnaires were distributed to micro-entrepreneurs in three states in Malaysia, namely, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu. This study used the partial least squares (PLS) analysis using the SmartPLS 3.2. Findings: The study found that the most robust Islamic financial literacy factors are financial behavior, followed by financial knowledge and financial attitude.The outcome of Islamic financial literacy, which is financial sustainability, also demonstrates a positive and significant relationship. Social implications: All variables show a positive and significant relationship toward financial sustainability. Stated differently, micro-entrepreneurs are aware that understanding the basic concepts of Islamic finance may help them achieve long-term financial sustainability Originality/value: This study incorporates Islamic financial concepts into financial literacy while also assessing demographic aspects like years of business operation and education as moderators, which were not considered by previous studies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Small retail businesses are essential for the growth of the South African economy. Though many of these business entities need more assets to seize business opportunities, previous research studies suggest that their overall access to finance through banks and other finance providers seems to be limited. In general, small retail businesses are usually managed by entrepreneurs who lack financial knowledge, but banks, when deciding on credit applications, rely heavily on financial information, which is provided by these entrepreneurs. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, this study aimed to explore barriers that limit access to finance for South African small retailers, from the perspectives of finance providers (banking institutions) and finance seekers (small retailers). Additionally, measures were highlighted to show how those hurdles could be overcome. Qualitative research was conducted, whereby data were collected via semi-structured interviews with management personnel at banks and other financial institutions, as well as independent experts and small retail business owners and managers. The findings show that many financing opportunities are available to small retail businesses, but access to these opportunities is limited mainly owing to, inter alia, strict bank regulations and factors that are inherent to small retail business owners. © Holger J.

AB  - The purpose of the article is theoretical and methodological substantiation of the state and post-war prospects of financial inclusion in Ukraine, taking into account the experience of EU countries. The objectives of the study are as follows: to theoretically sub-stantiate the content and features of financial inclusion, taking into account the experience of EU countries; to assess the current state of financial inclusion; and to outline post-war prospects for the development of financial inclusion in Ukraine. It is argued that the key parameters of financial inclusion are financial well-being, financial behaviour, financial knowledge, and the utilization of financial products, as well as physical access to financial services. Drawing on the experience of EU countries, it is substantiated that creating conditions for free access to financial services for all categories of the population and businesses, as well as their digitalization, contribute to the growth of citizens' income, the simplification of investment mechanisms, and thus the economic development of the country. An assessment of the state of financial inclusion in Ukraine is conducted through online surveys of various categories of citizens. It is determined that Ukrainians feel a strong need for additional sources of income, and the financial situation of the majority of them is extremely unstable. Based on the results of correlation-regression analysis, the priorities of financial inclusion are identified as the level of financial literacy and competency among the population. This will enable them to budget their income and expenses, promote the transformation of savings into investments, and have a positive impact on the post-war recovery of the country's economy. © 2023 by the author(s).

AB  - Financial modeling for the life insurance industry involves two main difficulties: (1) Selecting the minimal and critical variables for modeling while considering the impreciseness and interrelationships among the numerous attributes and (2) measuring plausible synergy effects among variables and dimensions that might cause undesirable biases for an evaluation model. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes a two-stage hybrid approach: Rough financial knowledge is retrieved first, and then the obtained core attributes are measured and synthesized using fuzzy-integral-based decision methods. The main innovation of this study is the use of rough knowledge retrieval procedures and fuzzy measures for exploring the synergy effects on financial performance. This approach is expected to support insurers to systematically improve their financial performance. A group of life insurance companies in Taiwan was analyzed, and the findings support the existence of interrelated synergy effects among the core criteria. In addition, five companies were examined to illustrate financial performance improvement planning with this approach. This study bridges the gap between advanced soft computing techniques and pragmatic financial modeling in a dynamic business environment. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The content and form of relationship value dominate the literature. The study aims to add to relationship value research by examining its dimensions and outcomes. The relationship value presents a new taxonomy beyond the cost and benefit conception of value that dominates existing literature. Its consisting of four dimensions, i.e., personal, financial, knowledge and strategic value. The focus of the research, which synthesizes a conceptual framework from the relationship value framework, is on business-to-business situations and the value of the relationship to the manufacturer. Using structural equation modeling, the study examines the influence of relationship value on relational trust, relational commitment and performance. The sample covers 259 retailers categorized as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia. It was found that relationship value drives relational trust and relational commitment perceived by retailers. In addition, both of them are key factors that nurture the value of relationships between manufacturers and retailers. Finally, relationship value is a determinant of business performance. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Women’s disadvantage in financial knowledge impedes their progress toward gender equality and produces negative consequences for both individuals and households. To better understand the gender gap in financial knowledge and shed light on possible intervention strategies, this study focused on gender differences in financial knowledge specifically among college students. Drawing on data from the most recent administration of the Study on Collegiate Financial Wellness (SCFW; N = 18,107) among current college students from 38 public four-year institutions, we investigated the gender financial knowledge gap and paid particular attention to the roles of family financial socialization, financial education, and financial behaviors. We identified a sizable gender gap in financial knowledge, even after controlling for other potential factors. OLS regression models and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analyses showed that financial education—indicated by majoring in Business and STEM fields and formal financial courses in high school—was most related to the gender gap in financial knowledge scores. Hands-on financial behaviors were positively associated with financial knowledge acquisition, particularly for female students. In addition, the family socialization process was largely not associated with students’ financial knowledge scores or the gender knowledge gap. Based on these findings, we discussed potential intervention strategies for promoting financial knowledge and reducing the gender gap among and beyond college students. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The financial literacy of today’s students is essential to their future success. Colleges and universities struggle to develop methods for training students in financial literacy. This study investigates the financial literacy of college students, looking at individual factors of financial background, race, gender, major and motivation in order to understand if students are learning enough to be considered financially literate, and how to structure a course in order to improve overall literacy. Findings demonstrate a lack of financial literacy among students who aren’t business majors, haven’t been exposed to previous financial courses, and lack overall confidence in their financial literacy. © 2019, North American Business Press.

AB  - The contribution of Indian women in family, businesses and society is today being recognized. The role of women in the family decisions is also increasing with the change in demographics as more women are now participating in economic activities. With the change in education, employment and contribution in the earnings of the family, her say in the family decisions are increasing. When it comes to the investment decisions, women tend to be risk averse, have conservative attitude, lower levels of financial knowledge, lack of confidence and dependent on guidance from others as suggested by different researches worldwide. The role of husband becomes particularly important for women while choosing investment products or taking investment decisions. This article attempts to highlight the role of women in investment decision making in the family and further examines the role of a male spouse on the investment decisions. The objectives of the study were to examine the behavior of working women while taking investment decisions; and to identify the extent to which the investment decisions of the working women are influenced by the spouse/husband. The article further highlights that, when it comes to investment decisions, both husband and wife share responsibility for making investment decisions. There are investment products like Bank deposits, 5 year tax saving FDs, precious metals, public provident fund, national pension system, post office saving schemes, mutual funds, life insurance, and commodities, where the influence of women is stronger than their male spouse. The influence of a male spouse is stronger in products like real estate, company deposits, debentures or bonds, pension schemes, equity shares and derivatives. © 2019 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors.

AB  - Orientation: Among the numerous factors affecting small and medium enterprises’ (SMEs) ability to access funding, financial literacy or the lack thereof continues to rank high. The below-average levels of financial literacy among entrepreneurs inevitably restrict their access to finance, thereby adding to the already soaring rate of small business failure. Research purpose: The main research objective of this article is to determine the underlying financial literacy-financial access relationship among SMEs in the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality in South Africa. Motivation of the study: Understanding the relationship between financial literacy and financial access among small businesses is imperative as they are key players in economic development. Empirical literature outlining this relationship is sparse. Therefore, the study made an original empirical contribution to the financial literacy-financial access nexus in the metropolitan. Research design, approach and method: A quantitative descriptive research design was followed. The survey method was used to gather data, where structured questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. The study considered a targeted population of 5609 registered SMEs in Ekurhuleni with a sample size of 384 prospective participants. A total of 310 responses were obtained from the owners and managers of SMEs in the municipality. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to compute all statitical analyses for the study. Descriptive statistics were used to establish the SMEs’ financial literacy and financial access relationship. Data were analysed using factor analysis, regression analysis and correlation analysis. Main findings: Entrepreneurs in Ekurhuleni were found to have a limited understanding of basic financial concepts implying low levels of financial knowledge. Additionally, the study established that financial access was significantly challenging for most SMEs. The findings further revealed a positive relationship between financial literacy and financial access. Practical managerial/ implications: The knowledge from this article may assist entrepreneurs and financial institutions in bridging the financial literacy gap, thereby increasing the likelihood of accessing funding by SMEs. It may also assist in influencing the development and implementation of micro and macroeconomics policies to raise financial literacy levels and leniency from financing sources towards SMEs. © 2023.

AB  - The present study explores the financing behaviour of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) owners. A nexus of owners’ personal attributes (PC) and behavioural aspects including financial knowledge (FK), financing motivation (M), and risk taking ability (R) has been created to determine the financing preferences (FP) and capital structure decision (CSD) of firm owners. The research framework adopts quantitative approach to the analysis. 274 responses were collected and analysed through partial least squares structural equation modelling on SmartPLSv2. The findings support the direct and mediating role of M and R in predicting FP and its relationship with PC. Moreover, the study confirms the role of FP in determining CSD in terms of pecking order behaviour among firm owners. The integration of owners’ personal characteristics and behavioural factors in determining firms’ financial decision adds value to the theory and practice of MSME financing.

AB  - Purpose: The emerging area of message classification is one of growing relevance to a wide range of organizational communicators as a variety of non-state organizations and their members increasingly use and misuse various terms to restrict their communication. This includes formal classifications for data security, financial/knowledge management, human resources, and other functions as well as those used informally by organizational members. Especially in a data-rich environment where our word-processing programs, e-mail tools, and other technologies afford us opportunities to engage in classification, a wide range of people at all organizational levels may serve as custodians of their own data and thus have the ability (as well as perhaps the need) to classify messages in various ways. The purpose of this paper is to describe key classification terms ranging from those found in government (e.g. top secret, confidential) to those in the private sector (e.g. business use only, trademarked) to an even wider set of terms used informally by organizational members (e.g. personal, preliminary). The growing use of message classifications will likely create various challenges and opportunities for organizations, their members, and the broader public/society. A set of future research questions is offered for corporate communication researchers and practitioners, who are well positioned to examine this emerging phenomenon. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on existing literature related to the growing use of message classifications to offer a list of classification terms and an agenda for future research. Findings: This work describes key classification terms ranging from those found in government (e.g. top secret, confidential) to those in the private sector (e.g. business use only, trademarked) to an even wider set of terms used informally by organizational members (e.g. personal, preliminary). This expanded notion of classification will likely create various challenges and opportunities for organizations, their members, and the broader public/society. Originality/value: The emerging area of message classification is one of growing relevance to a wide range of organizational communicators as a variety of non-state organizations and their members increasingly use and misuse various terms to restrict their communication. A set of future research questions is offered for corporate communication researchers and practitioners, who are well positioned to examine this emerging phenomenon. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Adequate financial management is of great importance to the health care system. In the contemporary state of affairs, health care is facing numerous limitations due to drastic costs and growing pressures to provide quality health care. In such appalling conditions, the managers of health organizations must build skills and knowledge that go beyond the comfort zone of their clinical competencies. It is necessary to develop their leadership skills. Bearing in mind the importance of financial competencies, the general aim of this paper is to determine the competencies of the managers of Serbian health institutions (private and public sector) in this area. Insufficient attention has been given to how health care organizations’ financial literacy affects their sustainability. For the purpose of this prospective research, a questionnaire was created that surveyed the managers of various health care institutions. The results of this study indicated that managers of health organizations have a relatively modest level of financial knowledge. However, they participate in financial activities to a large extent. This gap between the function they perform and the knowledge they have can potentially harm the well-being of the health care organizations they lead. Managers of organizations in the public sector showed a more active role in the development of business plans and more frequent independent decision making, while managers of organizations in the private sector gave more importance to financial control, negotiation, and internal financial reporting, for the improvement of the management process. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Business incubators (BIs) provide entrepreneurs with access to critical resources (for example, physical, financial, knowledge, social, legitimacy, and so on) that support venture development. Little is known about how support needs differ between entrepreneurs pursuing technology-based (TB) and creative-industry (CI) opportunities. Yet these differences may affect their ability to benefit from incubation. This is the first comparative study addressing this gap. Focusing on university BIs, our qualitative analysis reveals that TB entrepreneurs benefit from physical capital supporting proof of concept, financial grants, and technical and industry-specific knowledge capital. In contrast, CI entrepreneurs benefit from physical capital supporting product development, financing of smaller-scale projects, and knowledge capital focused on business basics. External legitimacy was more important to TB entrepreneurs, while internal social capital mattered more to CI entrepreneurs. We draw on value creation and capture to explain these differences. The findings have implications for research and practice concerned with incubation and university-based entrepreneurial support. © 2022 International Council for Small Business.

AB  - Purpose: The study focused on the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs at the Galerías Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia, from 2019 to 2023. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the paper is empirical-analytical, focusing on the tangible and unique aspects of reality that can be fragmented for measurement. This approach privileges the use of data from the study population’s experience, which is treated analytically through statistics to establish frequencies and correlations between variables. The research involved a structured questionnaire based on bibliographic references and considering the operational framework of the variables, which underwent expert review, necessary adjustments, a pilot test and subsequent validation in 2019 and 2023. The reliability of the instrument was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, ensuring a reliable indicator when equal to or greater than 0.7 in each analysis period. This methodology aimed to identify practices and how the financial profile influences short term. Findings: The findings from the survey conducted with the microentrepreneurs at Galerías Shopping Center reveal several significant connections to the theoretical framework. The study revealed that many microentrepreneurs relied on their personal funds for business financing, indicating a limited understanding of financial principles. Additionally, a significant portion of microentrepreneurs mitigated investment risk by securing loans from financial institutions, yet none utilized government subsidies like entrepreneurship loans, pointing to a lack of advice. The findings underscore the importance of financial education and suitable financial services for business development. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this study is the lack of detailed data on the financial structure of microentrepreneurs' businesses, as well as specific information on interest rates and the terms and conditions of the microcredit used. These limitations may affect the generalization of the results and the comprehensive understanding of the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs. Future research could include a larger sample size and more accurate data on the financial structure of businesses, as well as a detailed investigation of interest rates and terms and conditions of microcredit, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the financial impacts for microentrepreneurs. Practical implications: The findings of this study have practical implications for microentrepreneurs in the Galerías Shopping Center. The research emphasizes the need for improved financial knowledge, accounting practices and debt management among microentrepreneurs. It also highlights the importance of financial education and access to suitable financial services for business development. The study’s insights can guide the development of training programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing financial literacy and financial management among microentrepreneurs, leading to more informed decision-making and improved financial outcomes. Social implications: From a social perspective, this research contributes to promoting economic development and financial inclusion. By addressing the mismanagement of microcredit by microentrepreneurs and providing insights into their short-term finances, the study aims to foster economic empowerment and sustainable development within communities. The findings underscore the significance of microfinance in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. The research emphasizes the importance of equitable access to financial services, which can contribute to narrowing the gap between the financially excluded population and the conventional financial system. Originality/value: This research adds originality and value to the academic community by addressing the incidence of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs in the specific context of the Galerías Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia. By characterizing the financial profile of microentrepreneurs, establishing the relationship between microcredit characteristics and the financial profile and proposing an action plan, the study provides valuable insights for decision-making in both the academic and microfinance fields. The research contributes to the existing literature on microfinance and financial inclusion, offering a unique perspective and potential solutions for optimizing the use of microcredit-funded resources by microentrepreneurs. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Using data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, this study investigates factors that affect electronic banking adoption rates. Financial knowledge, income, education, and credit card ownership are associated with a high probability of electronic banking adoption. However, age is negatively associated with the probability of online banking adoption and the African American consumer is less likely to adopt electronic banking. This result is more prominent for African American women but does not hold for African American business owners. Financial counselors, planners, and educators should be aware and sensitive to these differences in order to provide additional education as needed on how to effectively use electronic banking services in order to achieve a greater degree of financial inclusion. © Copyright 2020 Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education, U.S.A.

AB  - Knowledge management tools and technology are the main factors bringing competitive advantage to organisations. This study extends the depth of study on small business entrepreneurs by examining the effect of knowledge acquisition, in particular financial knowledge that leads to the need for knowledge acquisition tools and technology. There is evidence to support that a lower level of existing financial knowledge in small business entrepreneurs encourages them to acquire more financial knowledge since they tend to be responsible for all tasks related to business survival. This finding is not consistent with several other previous studies. In addition, relevant knowledge on how to raise adequate capital to establish their business and the accurate calculation of cost are the two most important aspects of financial knowledge for encouraging small business entrepreneurs to seek effective knowledge acquisition tools and technology. The evidence provides insight for the government authorities supporting small businesses to provide financial knowledge to small business entrepreneurs during the pre-start-up phase and thereafter by providing the relevant knowledge on financing and cost calculation to strengthen and sustain these businesses. This will ultimately lead to an improvement in small business failure and increase the country’s economic growth. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The precarious manhood paradigm posits that threats to masculinity are met with attempts to reassert masculinity. We investigated the precarious manhood paradigm as applied to investment risk and foreign/domestic investment decisions. We sampled 652 men online, and tested whether threats to masculinity resulted in increases in investment risk and domestic investments in a hypothetical investment portfolio decision task. Results indicated that there was a main effect of threat for investment risk, such that those in the threat condition were willing to invest more in riskier investments. There was also an interaction with general risk-taking, such that men lower in general risk-taking responded to the threat condition by increasing investment in riskier options, while men higher in general risk-taking did not. A main effect of condition did not emerge for domestic investment, but there was an interaction, such that men lower in financial knowledge responded to the threat condition by increasing domestic investments, but men higher in financial knowledge did not. These results suggest that threats to masculinity influence financial investment decisions, and suggest that person-level variables (e.g., risk-taking, knowledge) may buffer the effects of threats to masculinity. © 2017 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The study of the contribution of incubators to economic growth started to gain momentum in the 1980s, following the growth of the incubation phenomenon. While acknowledging the challenge of evaluating incubators outcomes, we shift the focus from incubators performance to their internal processes, in particular, the interrelationships through which the incubator stakeholders share knowledge. The literature suggests that small new ventures tend to fail because they lack managerial experience and ability to raise capital in an early stage. Incubators are expected to overcome these obstacles by offering experienced monitoring skills and by enhancing access to capital at a firms early stage. However, empirical results of incubators ability to perform their role are often contradictory, making policy makers question their effectiveness. We provide evidence from Australian and Israeli incubators. Our findings suggest that collaborations between incubatees, graduated incubatees, and incubator management increase the incubatees knowledge of technology and market in both countries. Collaboration between incubatees and incubator management also increase incubatees financial knowledge and their likelihood of raising capital. We also found that universities played a modest role as a source of new ideas for incubatees, but a more important role in later stages of incubatees new product development processes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Financial citizenship is crucial in our modern world. Financial citizenship is underpinned by the education of future generations so that they can understand both their local and global economies to make the best financial decisions concerning their lives. This paper discusses financial literacy, how it relates to individual citizens, and how it correlates with social, political and business spheres. According to current financial capability models, every individual’s financial well-being can be boosted by developing their financial knowledge and competency, which will improve their motivations and confidence. Societal constructs significantly create financial socialization, which increases our accessibility and engagements with institutions, businesses, political systems and society as a whole. Being educated about the details required for financial literacy is every human being’s right. Citizens have been characterized as being personally responsible, participatory or justice oriented; each person’s specific perspective can impact their financial lives, which supports the importance of the current concept of financial citizenship. Boosting global education about economic citizenship will help to reduce poverty, create more sustainable economic environments, and improve social outcomes and the life satisfaction of the world population. These concepts will be explored and discussed in this paper. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Education is deliberated comprehensively as a gadget for growing financial development, authorizing people, valuing individual incomes, and humanizing a satisfying and elastic atmosphere that concretes the way for a well-off economy. It also offers suggestions gearing the new generations to contract with the contests of markets in the future. Deprived of a vigorous education curriculum, neither economic nor social development is conceivable in Pakistan. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the role of curriculum of higher education for fostering the economic development and find out relationship between curriculum and economic development. The subjects of this research were university students and sample of 600 university students were selected via stratified and simple random procedure. The collected data was analyzed by using descriptive statistics frequency percentage and correlation on SPSS version 28.0. The results exposed the low indications that the Pakistani curriculum is teaching the techniques of financial learning, financial intelligence to its youth. The results found that participants were incapable to capitalize and grasp businesses in the global market to revel in financial independence. Positive descriptions for educational institutes entails to update their curriculum with acquaint practical courses for youth with boosted job scenarios in the marketplace. A robust positive correlation between financial knowledge and job opportunities as an apprise in the curriculum with modern-day mandatory subjects can resulted to enhance opportunities for graduates in the job market. © 2023, Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women University.

AB  - The technological revolution we have been witnessing over the last 30 years is bringing about important changes in business management, specifically in the conception, development, and management of its financial aspects. How to face these challenges is a particularly critical question for individual entrepreneurs who have to assume a much greater responsibility for decisions than in other corporate environments. In this sense, it is very important to understand the financial capabilities and skills and their limitations of this type of entrepreneurship, which is so important for the renewal and extension of the business community in any developed economy. Based on an extensive official survey of this type of entrepreneurship, this research proposes a logistic regression modeling, in order to find out the level of financial knowledge of this business group. One of the findings of this research is that individual entrepreneurs have a higher level of financial knowledge than salaried workers, with a higher qualification in this respect in the case of individual entrepreneurs with employees. This study analyses the link between individual entrepreneurs or self-employed workers – with or without employees – and financial literacy. In addition, we investigated the relationship between this group with their socio-demographic characteristics, financial product holdings, financial planning, and financial fragility. Different binary logistic regression models with maximum likelihood were estimated using a sample of individual entrepreneurs and self-employed workers from the Survey of Financial Competences database conducted in Spain to achieve this. The results of the study show that individuals who choose to be individual entrepreneurs or self-employed, and in particular those with hired workers, had a higher level of financial literacy than salaried workers. Moreover, it was confirmed that financial literacy complements the explanatory power of the other variables analyzed with respect to sole proprietors without employees, although not to a significant degree. The limitations of this work are due to the use of data from the Financial Skills Survey, so some dichotomous variables offer very generic information. In addition, the database is cross-sectional and we cannot analyze variations between different periods. No research before had applied the relationships between the behavior of individual entrepreneurs, with and without employees, and financial competencies using logistic functions and on the basis of a rigorous and comprehensive formal questionnaire. The conclusions provide a valuable perspective for developing training programs for this type of human capital aimed at raising the financial skills of individual entrepreneurs to improve personal and business management. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper extends the theory of fuzzy diseases predictions in order to detect the causes of business failure. This extension is justified through the advantages of the reference model and its originality. Moreover, the fuzzy model is completed by this proposal and some parts of it have been published in isolated articles. For this purpose, the fuzzy theory is combined with the OWA operators to identify the factors that generate problems in firms. Also, a goodness index to validate its functionality and prediction capacity is introduced. The model estimates a matrix of economic-financial knowledge based on matrices of causes and symptoms. Knowing the symptoms makes it possible to estimate the causes, and managing them properly, allows monitoring and improving the company's financial situation and forecasting its future. Also with this extension, the model can be useful to develop suitable computer systems for monitoring companies' problems, warning of failures and facilitating decision-making. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - This study examines the association between Chinese stock issuers’ board characteristics and dividends. We focus on the gender of CEO and accompanying board members, as well as other salient board demographics and characteristics. Using more than 9,000 firm-year observations, we observe little difference in the dividend distributions of female- and male-led Chinese firms. Other salient demographics, notably CEO age and tenure bear a strong positive association with cash distributions. Cash pay-out is also increasing in directors’ equity stakes and state ownership. In a general sense, the proportion of independent directors on boards bears only limited association with cash pay-out. However, in state-invested entities, greater independent director presence acts as a brake against cash distributions. We challenge a lingering perception in the investment literature that women are significantly more risk-averse than men. Cross-cultural theory suggests that risk aversion is manifest in greater cash retention and thus lower pay-outs (Bae, Chang, & Kang, The Journal of Financial Research, 35(2): 289–316, 2012; Khambata & Liu, Journal of Asia-Pacific Business, 6(4): 31–43, 2005). Building on this literature, and extending it specifically to gender, our results are consistent with male and female CEOs displaying comparable levels of risk aversion. They are also congruent with “financial knowledge” lessening gender-based differences in risk aversion (Hibbert, Lawrence, & Prakash, Global Finance Journal, 24: 140–152, 2013) and/or its general absence in the specific field of financial decisions (Schubert, Brown, Gysler, & Brachinger, The American Economic Review, 89(2): 381–385, 1999). We also emphasize theory on managerial power (Allen, Social Forces, 60(2): 482–494, 1981) and entrenchment. Results for CEO tenure and age support notions of CEO entrenchment, while those for duality do not. In contrast to agency theory, but consistent with tunneling arguments, the present study stresses the overarching role of state-ownership in increasing (decreasing) cash (stock) payouts. We observe non-monotonic effects in this relation, thus extending related findings elsewhere (Huang, Chen, & Kao, Asia Pacific Journal of Management, 29: 39–58, 2012). © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of financial literacy on financial well-being among the business school faculties. Both the variables (financial literacy and financial well-being) are operationalized as multi-dimensional constructs to undertake the study. Moreover, the paper also endeavored to examine the mediating role of financial self-efficacy between financial literacy and financial well-being. The paper adopts a survey by questionnaire method to gather data from 203 business school faculty members through the simple random sampling (SRS) technique. Confirmatory factor analysis was used for scale validation, and structural equation modeling was used for hypotheses testing. Mediation was tested using percentile bootstrap with a 95% confidence interval. The study found a significantly positive impact of financial literacy as well as its dimensions on financial self-efficacy and financial well-being. It was also found that financial self-efficacy partially mediates the effect of financial literacy on financial well-being. Measurement of the constructs was done on subjective measures, and the study is limited to business school faculties only. The present research findings could be employed in crafting educational programs for business schools. These programs shall guide such institutions in imparting the knowledge and skills among students regarding their personal finances in terms of savings and retirement planning. The study was focused on the business school faculties of the Jammu and Kashmir region, who are less exposed to the financial literacy programs due to factors like frequent lockdown and internet shutdowns. Moreover, it is generally witnessed that salaried class people in Jammu and Kashmir pay less attention to long-term financial planning for retirement, which makes the present study more relevant. Therefore, this study will prove beneficial to all the employees, especially the business school faculties, to understand the importance of financial literacy and its subsequent effect on financial well-being. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2022.

AB  - Most doctors complete their medical training without sufficient knowledge of business and finance. This leads to inefficient financial decisions, avoidable losses, and unnecessary anxiety. A big part of the problem is that the existing options for gaining financial knowledge are flawed. The ideal solution is to provide a simple framework of financial literacy to all students: one that can be adapted to their specific circumstances. That framework must be delivered by an objective expert to young physicians before they complete medical training.

AB  - Recently, sustainable development goals (SDG) and investment strategies and knowledge has become the foremost factors for the high organizational profitability and capture the focus of recent studies and policymakers. Therefore, the current study aims to examine the impact of SDG, investment strategies and financial knowledge on the organizational profitability of manufacturing firms in China. Furthermore, the study examines the role of government support in the interplay between investment plans, financial understanding, and the profitability of organisations. Survey questionnaires and smart-PLS were used to collect data and analyse reliability and correlations. The findings show that SDGs, investment strategies, and financial knowledge all play a substantial role in a company's profitability.The results also revealed that government support moderates significantly among investment strategies, financial knowledge, and organizational profitability. This study guides the regulators while developing policies regarding SDG and investment strategies with respect to organizational profitability. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Having subject knowledge is not the sufficient for an engineering student especially in the recent economic status of the country. Students are expected to require skills such as problem-solving, communication skills, dealing with information and abilities to ensure their employability in future. Nowadays most of the graduates are interested in starting a business of their own. Moreover, entrepreneurs are one among the important factors for the economic growth in a country. Knowing about entrepreneurship includes management, marketing skills, and finance. In addition, knowledge about financial management is also required for learners to know the commercial opportunities to face the business issues. Apart from this, creating a mindset for engineering students to involve in business should also be considered. The present article observes the role of engineering students in sustaining the Economic Development and their awareness about the financial systems of the country. The paper deals with the issue that how far teaching about the economic aspects is taking place in engineering classes. Since engineers play a prominent role in developing financial status of the country much emphasis is not given to teaching economic and financial knowledge for engineering students. Therefore the paper suggest that knowledge about economic aspects of the country has to be imparted in engineering classes to show that engineers are also responsible for development of the country. © IAEME Publication.

AB  - Developing financial literacy is a crucial part of entrepreneurship. It can aid aspiring entrepreneurs to learn how to analyze market trends, formulate business plans, conduct cost accounting activities, and navigate fiscal risks in their businesses. Therefore, we investigated the most recent dataset on rural residents in China to determine the effects of financial literacy on their entrepreneurial behaviors. Our observations reveal that individuals with high financial literacy, that is, those who have attained advanced financial knowledge, are more likely to start a business than those with low financial literacy. We employed instrumental variable analysis to mitigate the endogeneity of financial literacy. Results show a causal relationship between Chinese rural residents’ financial literacy and entrepreneurship. Finally, we demonstrate that the aggressive risk attitudes of rural families magnify the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurship. © 2024

AB  - We investigate the limited use of bank and microfinance loans by Tanzanian female entrepreneurs. Using survey data, we observe that female entrepreneurs mainly use informal sources to finance their businesses. We analyze how “perceptions” of gendered cognitive and normative institutions determine whether a female entrepreneur applies for a formal loan. Following results stand out: first, we find that high collateral requirements, interest rates and personal guarantee requirements make formal loans unattractive. Second, female entrepreneurs only apply when they expect to be successful. Since they “perceive” access to finance to be more problematic for women, female entrepreneurs are discouraged from applying. Third, female entrepreneurs “perceive” they have insufficient access to financial knowledge which again will prevent them from applying. This study contributes to theory by exploring the effect of entrepreneurs’ perceptions of the institutional business environment on financing behavior. Furthermore, we show that the low use of formal loans by female entrepreneurs is primarily demand-driven, which calls into question the effectivity of policy recommendations aiming to increase supply of formal loans. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Motivated by the recent increases in entrepreneurship in developing countries, this empirical article aims at determining the risk preferences of male and female entrepreneurs using cross-sectional data from 161 MSMEs in Ghana, and the Arrow-Pratt risk model. A multiple linear regression was later employed to ascertain factors influencing entrepreneurs’ attitudes toward risk. A decomposition of the risk attitude shows Ghanaian entrepreneurs to be generally risk averse. Upon further investigation, we find males to be more extreme risk averse than females, while females are more risk neutral than males. The gender difference in risk aversion is significantly explained by predictor variables, such as socio-economic factors, having access to funds, type of business operated, sector of operation, financial knowledge, and the cultural values of the entrepreneurs. We find a positive relationship between financial knowledge and attitude toward risk, and recommend the need for investment in both formal and informal education that increases the financial knowledge of entrepreneurs, hence, reduce the risk associated with entrepreneurship in Ghana. Theoretically, the article integrates cultural, financial knowledge, and religious variables into the determinant of risk attitude of male and female entrepreneurs and practically demonstrates that increasing the financial knowledge decreases the risk aversion nature of entrepreneurs. © 2021 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil Canadien de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.

AB  - Financial literacy (FL) is an important ability needed by any individual to understand, evaluate, and communicate business and financial information. Having accurate financial information increases one’s competency to be financial literate. It is regarded as a common and basic life skill that libraries can develop for their users. Using purposive sampling, this study ponders into the status and challenges of eight public city libraries in the Philippines in terms of providing FL education and how they can potentially share a role in developing the economy of a country. Public libraries’ readiness to serve their users can be observed in terms of their collection, web presence, services, and programs. The level of financial knowledge and competencies of city librarians were also assessed. A look into the available professional development programs for public librarians in business and finance librarianship was reviewed. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore to what extent different obstacles (financial, knowledge, market, and perception) affect the propensity of Mexican family firms to engage in innovation activity. Second, it examines whether the perception of these obstacles differs between two subgroups of family firms, considering levels of ownership and family management control. Design/methodology/approach: Information was gathered through a CIS methodology-based questionnaire applied to 161 CEOs of Mexican family firms. Binomial logistic regressions were performed identifying obstacles that were truly relevant for the family firm subgroups in the sample. Findings: For subgroup 1, knowledge and market factors were significant and negatively related to the propensity to engage in innovation activities; for subgroup 2, only market factors were relevant. The results also show how the tenure of the CEO, the number of generations involved, and the family involvement in management and non-management positions affect the results obtained. Practical implications: Implications for family business scholars embrace the assessment criteria of different family business definitions. While the implications for managers and policy makers include the recognition of the factors that affect innovation in Mexican family firms in order to design and implement adequate strategies to overcome them. Originality/value: This study addresses some of the raised demands in the literature. First, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first attempt to explore the factors hampering innovation in family firms in Latin America. Second, this study was undertaken in response to the call for exploring variations in innovation behavior across different family business types in regards to ownership and family management control. Moreover, this study responds to the call to analyze financial and non-financial factors separately and to expand the geographical areas, sectors, and sizes of family firms, more specifically in Latin America. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Substantial research results suggest the global financial crisis has negatively affected consumers' trust in financial service providers. Notably, trust not only relates to consumer trust in individual companies but also relates to the broader business context in which consumers may plan and carry out their financial behavior. This latter form of trust can be referred to as “broad-scope” trust (BST). BST is especially important in a society context because lack of BST may reduce financial market dynamism, competition, and productivity. Consequently, financial service providers assume an important social responsibility in order to develop BST. Unfortunately, not much is known about the interplay between BST and consumer financial behavior. Based on two surveys comprising 1155 bank consumers and 756 mutual fund investors, respectively, this study investigates the moderating influence of BST on relations between knowledge, cognitive effort, and financial healthiness and also examines the direct influence of BST on cognitive effort and financial healthiness. The results indicate that BST negatively moderates relations between knowledge and financial healthiness and between cognitive effort and financial healthiness. In addition, it is demonstrated that BST negatively influences cognitive effort and positively influences financial healthiness. Our results demonstrate the importance of developing BST as it may ease the burdens put on consumers' financial knowledge and processing capabilities, which in turn may facilitate their financial well-being.

AB  - We use unique administrative data and a quasi-field experiment of exogenous allocation in Sweden to estimate medium-and longer-run effects of peoples' exposure to financially literate neighbors on their financial behavior. We contribute evidence of (1) a causal impact of exposure and of a social multiplier of financial knowledge and (2) unfavorable distributional aspects of externalities. Exposure promotes saving in private retirement accounts and stockholding, especially when neighbors have economics or business education, but only for educated households and for substantial interaction possibilities. Findings point to a transfer of knowledge rather than mere imitation or effects through labor, education, or mobility channels.

AB  - This research investigates the role of financial literacy on initiating and achieving a favorable negotiation outcome in an employment context. With a goal of improving long-term financial well-being, extant research examines whether increasing a person's understanding of basic financial concepts (“financial literacy”) improves his/her financial decision-making. The current research proposes broader effects of financial literacy via negotiation behavior. We follow prior research to measure financial literacy both objectively (as the accurate assessment of basic financial concepts, “financial knowledge”) and subjectively (as confidence in the application of basic financial skills and concepts, “financial confidence”). In a series of studies engaging students from undergraduate business courses and adults recruited from an online crowdsourcing service, this research examines the relationship between these measures of financial literacy and (a) the likelihood of initiating a negotiation and (b) the likely outcome from a negotiation, if initiated. Results suggest that financial confidence impacts participants’ willingness to engage in negotiation, while financial knowledge impacts the level of participants’ first offer. These findings suggest financial literacy has important implications for career advancement and compensation, as well as the successful management of interpersonal communications, even in fields not traditionally thought of as focusing on numerical reasoning skills. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In the last decade, developed and emerging economies have become increasingly aware of the importance of ensuring that their citizens are financially literate. Eighteen countries and economies, including 13 OECD countries, participated for the first time in 2012 on the financial literacy assessment of 15-year-old students. Financial literacy scores varied according to the participating countries, and they were determined by factors related to the teaching-learning process, especially those related to the delivery of financial education in schools. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the provision of financial education in the school curriculum across all the countries that participated in PISA 2012—data from 2015 did not allow such analysis. We measured the direct effect of different ways of financial education delivery on students' financial literacy scores, after controlling for math and reading performance, and individual characteristics of students and their schools. The majority of the countries have introduced financial education topics in the curriculum somehow. But only in the Flemish Community of Belgium, the United States, and Latvia—and to a lesser extent in Australia, Estonia, France, Israel, Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, and the Slovak Republic—the way how financial education (FE) is delivered is positively correlated with students' financial literacy scores: FE taught as part of business or economics courses in Belgium, FE taught as part of a cross-curricular subject in the U.S., and FE taught as part of mathematics in Latvia. Our main findings pose fundamental challenges for educational policy regarding school-based FE. The first is to decide at what age (grade) interventions should be introduced into the education system so that students are not only financially literate but also financially competent. The second is to devise instructional approaches that more effectively lead young people to put pertinent financial knowledge into practice and to do so correctly when they make financial decisions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study analysed the level of financial literacy among university students in Estonia, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation and Turkey. The purpose of the study was to determine the level of financial literacy among university students, and to find out the relationship between financial knowledge and demographic characteristics of students. Online survey instrument was used to collect data. 409 fully completed questionnaires were accepted for analysis. Logistic regression was used to analyse of impact of the demographic characteristics on financial literacy. Overall mean of correct answers for the survey was 72.2%. This result represents a medium level of financial literacy about personal finance. Results indicate that male students, business major students, PhD students, those who live in a rental house, those whose parents have high level income, those who get advice on financial matters from their friends, those who took financial course before, those who get financial information about financial issues from university education, and students from Poland are more knowledgeable on personal finance. More financial courses should be provided in university education programmes, which could help more students handle their finances better and improve their financial wellbeing. It should be taken into consideration that in recent years, environmental and technological influences on financial literacy may be more important than parental influence. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The overreliance on the audit committee’s (AC) financial knowledge solely to enhance its oversight role is detrimental to corporate governance practices. The evidence about the effect of other characteristics that can be crucial for the efficiency of the AC, which affects audit and financial statements quality, is lacking. The study aims to explore the influence of AC members’ independence, the involvement of female executives, and the specific characteristics of the French business landscape on the quality of audits. In this investigation, 930 data points were analysed, drawn from a selection of 93 French companies listed on the SBF 120 index over a decade, spanning from 2012 to 2021. The research reveals that while AC independence positively contributes to audit quality, the expertise of committee members and gender diversity have a significant adverse effect on audit quality. This may have implications for decision-makers in France as well as in other nations with similar institutional environments that they should consider when developing future regulatory reforms.

AB  - Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) plays a significant role for the economic development of a country. Specifically, the existence of SMEs is to contribute in poverty alleviation through job creation. However, not many SMEs can survive and grow their business due to limited access to obtain resources such as financial, technological, and human resources. One of the factors that inhibit the development of MSMEs in Indonesia is the lack of knowledge and management of personal finance. In addition, the participation rate of SMEs to financial institutions is still very low, with only 30% able to access financing. This study aims to analyse the level of financial literacy, the factors that affect the level of financial literacy, and the correlation between the level of financial literacy (proxied by general knowledge, risk management, savings and credits, and investment) with funding decision. The data used are primary data and secondary data, with data collection methods conducted in this study are literature studies, interviews and questionnaires with SMEs in Bandung, Indonesia, with a sample used as many as 97 respondents. The respondents’ financial literacy in low level on general financial knowledge, savings & credits, and investment. But they have medium financial literacy level on insurance. The data processed using discriminant analysis, shows that the average financial literacy level which is in low level and has no effect on funding decision-making.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates the relationship between executive compensation and firm performance in Chinese new energy companies. Design/Methodology/Approach: The financial data of 122 Chinese-listed energy companies from 2010-2021 is selected for the empirical study. Findings: Executives' monetary compensation and executives' shareholding ratio are positively related to corporate performance. Overseas background and financial background play a moderating role in the effect of executives' monetary compensation and their shareholding ratio on corporate performance. Conclusion: The fact that executives' salaries and shareholding both have a significant positive impact on business performance demonstrates the effectiveness of pay incentives and equity-based incentive. The research additionally demonstrates that an executive's financial knowledge and experience in other countries alter the impact of cash and equity pay on company performance. Research Limitations/Implications: The research excludes a large number of key energy businesses, especially rising ones in the clean energy sector, as it solely targets publicly traded businesses for ease of data collection. Practical Implications: The survey results help to further understand the key factors of compensation incentives for managers in energy companies and are informative for the effectiveness of compensation incentives in energy companies. Contribution to Literature: This study provides empirical results on the impact of managerial compensation on firm performance in energy firms in the Chinese context, adding a new step to the existing literature. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigates the essential characteristics of the personal financial landscape of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Saudi Arabia, with a specific focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 154 respondents, comprising owners, managers, and administrators of Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, were surveyed to gather data. The results of the study indicate that younger entrepreneurs and businesses experienced greater financial consequences, particularly among owners aged 18–30 and 31–45, compared to older age groups. However, both younger and older entrepreneurs demonstrated a higher level of financial knowledge and awareness regarding emergency finance options. Overall, the outbreak had a significant impact on both the national and global economies. This study offers a significant contribution to the extant body of literature pertaining to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). © 2023 asociación Cuadernos de economía.

AB  - Low business outlook due to poor financial decisions among students has continued to attract interest of financial educators and professionals. Previous studies have interrogated financial literacy with sparse attention given to business risk-taking among students' start-ups in Nigeria. This research gap forms the basis of this study. The aim of this paper is the interrogation of financial knowledge and financial behavior as a lever for business risk-taking among start-up students of the University of Lagos, Nigeria. The philosophical perspective drew insight from the positivist approach with a random sampling of 145 final-year students selected from the departments of Business Administration, Accounting and Employment, and Labour Relations of the Faculty of Management Sciences. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and Bartlett's test were conducted to determine sample adequacy. Regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. The results show that financial knowledge and behavior of start-ups revealed a high propensity to be engaged in business risk-taking (β = .407, t (511) = 7.556, p < 0.05; β = .412, t (1.511) = 7.525, p < 0.05) with males showing more financial literacy understanding for business risk than females (β = .591, t (2;510) = 4.381, p < 0.05; β = .280, t (2;510) = 2.217, p = 0.262) respectively. The findings show the need for the continuous development of students' start-up behavioral and attitudinal disposition, especially females in becoming more financial literate for appropriate financial decision-making in business risk-taking and venture creation. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

AB  - An entrepreneur is often driven by a quest for innovation and creativity in a market, thus creating competition. The competition will create wealth, leading to improved living standards for individuals and the economy at large. Moreover, innovation and creation result in new and superior products that enable modern markets to be developed. However, the enthusiasm to become an entrepreneur is not the sole driving factor. One must know the importance of financial literacy. Besides, the negative stigma due to the COVID-19 pandemic ruined many lives and impacted businesses with less money due to the reduction of clientele; also, it had impacted budding entrepreneurs (at early start-up stages, and hardly have had experience between 1-3 years) with fewer opportunities to make money. That reduced the willingness of entrepreneurs to invest capital in the business due to raging losses. The current article presents the importance of financial literacy for budding entrepreneurs. To find and measure the financial literacy among budding entrepreneurs, the data were distributed to 223 entrepreneurs; however, 179 were finally used for analysis due to several reasons mentioned in the research methodology. The data was collected from five districts of the South region of India (Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu) and the snowball technique is used in the analysis. The study revealed that most budding entrepreneurs lack proper financial literacy. The study found that Financial Skills, Financial Knowledge, Financial Attitude, Social Interactions & Past Experiences, Financial Support & Guidance directly influenced Financial Literacy levels among entrepreneurs. The study also suggests that aspiring entrepreneurs should be given practical financial training sessions; it should be made mandatory. © Universal Journal of Accounting and Finance 2021.

AB  - Purpose: Considering the importance of financial literacy (FL) in people’s lives the goal of this study aims to assess the level of FL of young Portuguese students, addressing the impact of the level of education on the FL of college students. Design/methodology/approach: Data from a non-probabilistic sample of 185 students attending higher education bachelor’s and master’s degrees courses in Economics, Management and Marketing was collected between February 25 and March 23, 2019, using an online questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed using IBM SPSS 25 to analyze the data. Findings: The findings show that the level of the degree (bachelor’s or master’s degree) and the academic background of the individual’s parents have a positive impact on FL. Moreover, among individuals with a high level of FL, gender and professional situation are additional predictors. Furthermore, the authors observed that the level of FL of Portuguese students attending higher education is overall low, especially in terms of their knowledge of the main financial concepts, which may call for public policies to be implemented so that to reduce this vulnerability. Research limitations/implications: Among limitations is the limited sample collected, restricted to a particular target, Portuguese students attending business-related courses such as Economics, Management and Marketing, either studying for a master’s or bachelor’s degree. This issue restricts the generalization of the overall findings to other students studying different fields. Future studies can collect a random and representative sample. Practical implications: This study test can be replicated to generate a diagnosis in any region or country, identifying how financially literate the region under analysis is. Also, this can be done to verify the evolution of FL after educational interventions. Social implications: FL is an important competence. In fact, youngsters in the whole world have been suffering from a lack of financial knowledge (FK), and some characteristics of them can push them into indebtedness, and, even bankruptcy, such as a higher level of status consumption, the tendency to have an attitude of self-appraisal, to be self-centered, to seek instant gratification. This study helps to lead to a better understanding of this phenomenon. Originality/value: Addressing college students attending different levels is an add-on to the existing body of literature. This paper contributes to study differences in FL between college and master students, enlightening and evaluating the role of scholarship maturity on financial education. Furthermore, some of the findings challenge the extant knowledge regarding the influence of professional experience, gender and age on the level of FK that students have. Finally, the current approach is innovative as it addresses FK, FL and numeracy in the same study. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the role of mental accounting, financial attitude, and financial self-efficacy on financial behavior. Furthermore, this study examines the effect of financial knowledge on mental accounting, financial attitude, and financial self-efficacy. This study uses 400 student respondents who have businesses. Data analysis using PLS. The results show that financial behavior is influenced by mental accounting, financial attitude, and financial self-efficacy. However, financial knowledge did not increase mental accounting and financial self-efficacy. This study proves that mental accounting is very important for student success in business. Mental accounting controls the mindset of young entrepreneurs in managing finances so that they have a positive financial attitude, good financial self-efficacy, and effective financial behavior. From this study, we believe that mental accounting plays an important role for young entrepreneurs in financial decision-making. However, financial knowledge does not necessarily influence the mental accounting mindset. © 2022 Radianto et al.

AB  - Purpose: Debt is at a peak and consumers purport needing help with financial planning. To better understand the antecedents of financial planning behavior, the purpose of this paper is to examine the importance of cultural values in financial decision making within the context of Hispanic American consumers. A new conceptual model is proposed to integrate affect (cultural value) and cognition (financial knowledge) in financial planning. Design/methodology/approach: To uncover respondents’ views on cultural values, financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial planning behavior, an online survey hosted on a business school’s website was distributed to members of two Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. The survey consisted of five parts, and took each respondent an average of 15 minutes to complete. The final data set has 158 observations. Findings: Results analyzed using structural equation modeling confirmed the hypotheses that financial knowledge, attitude, and perceived control simultaneously influence Hispanic consumers’ intentions to purchase financial planning products or services. More interestingly, these results confirm that multiple different routes coexist in the decision-making process, especially within the Hispanic financial planning context. Originality/value: Key contributions of this paper include the conceptualization of cultural value as an antecedent to Hispanic financial behavior; detailing the different routes to financial decision making for US Hispanic consumers; and informing financial service managers on marketing strategies toward Hispanic consumers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the need for knowledge acquisition tools and the level of knowledge acquisition in the context of financial knowledge, as well as the use of different knowledge acquisition tools by small restaurant entrepreneurs. This study involves two phases. In phase 1, a qualitative approach was employed using an in-depth interview method. In-depth interviews were conducted with 9 small restaurant entrepreneurs in order to obtain insight into their level of knowledge acquisition in the context of financial knowledge, their level of use for various knowledge acquisition tools (websites, Facebook, Line, YouTube, blogs, and mobile phone application), and their need for knowledge acquisition tools. Interview responses are explored using a thematic content analysis. In phase 2, a quantitative approach was employed using a survey questionnaire, collecting responses from 320 small restaurant entrepreneurs. Through data generated from questionnaire responses, a hierarchical multiple regression was used to determine the relationship between the need for knowledge acquisition tools, and the level of knowledge acquisition in the context of financial knowledge. Cluster analysis techniques were used to identify the level of use for various knowledge acquisition tools, distributing entrepreneurs into different levels. The Cochran Q-test and McNemar test were used to study the difference in use of each knowledge acquisition tool by these entrepreneurs. The result suggests that small restaurant entrepreneurs with a greater need for financial knowledge acquisition tools tentatively acquire more financial knowledge. There is a difference in the level of use of knowledge acquisition tools by entrepreneurs, while the tools most commonly used for gaining financial knowledge are websites and Facebook. © 2021, ABAC Journal.

AB  - Recent and ongoing advancements in the field of ICT have led to the introduction of increasingly diversified financial products, and their use is improving people’s level of financial knowledge and skills. This article aims at assessing the effect of Fintech on the level of financial literacy of small business’ managers in Cameroon. To this end, information was gathered using a questionnaire from 209 small business managers in Cameroon. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), and multiple linear regression are used. Results lead to two main conclusions. On the one hand, unlike knowledge of their existence, the frequency of use of Fintech tools is better able to contribute to improving financial literacy levels overall. On the other hand, specifically, this result is of increased importance when it comes to competence and self-confidence in managing financial affairs. As a result, increasing the utilization of financial technology instruments in companies is imperative for efficiency. © 2024 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.

AB  - Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are among the cornerstones of the Indonesian economy that managed to survive the world crisis. The development of MSMEs also demands that owners be ready to compete with other MSMEs. This study aims to analyze whether business sustainability is influenced by financial literacy with financial behavior and financial technology as mediators. The research sample includes owners and managers of MSMEs in Indonesia, totaling 342 respondents. Data collection methods used are non-probability sampling techniques by distributing questionnaires. This study uses SEM analysis with PLS analysis tools. It was found that financial literacy does not directly affect business sustainability but affects financial behavior and financial technology. Financial behavior and financial technology are proven to influence business sustainability. Furthermore, financial behavior and financial technology mediate the effect of financial literacy on business sustainability. The results of this study show that financial behavior and financial technology can fully mediate the relationship between financial literacy and business sustainability. Moreover, financial literacy cannot directly affect business sustainability, which must be fully mediated by financial behavior and financial technology. This study also provides practical value regarding the sustainability of MSMEs. Thus, companies can survive in the long term not only with a robust financial literacy foundation but they must be supported by good financial behavior and also be able to choose the right financial technology in their business activities. © Bambang Widagdo, Chalimatuz Sa’diyah, 2023.

AB  - The research aims to investigate the entrepreneurial skills and financial literacy’s impact on the improved performance in the biotechnology sector. Entrepreneurial skills enable the individual to manage the business through taking essential actions, and along with financial literacy the utilization of resources in an optimum way is assured as well. The decision maker would invest in development of organizational capabilities required to succeed in market. Being a high risky domain, the utilization of financial resources through financial knowledge is crucial in biotech sector. To conduct this research, the quantitative research design including survey approach has been adopted. Questionnaires were distributed followed by the statistical testing of data through SPSS. The results indicated a significant association among financial literacy and performance along with a significant association between entrepreneurial skills and performance of biotechnology firms in Swiss. The research holds greater theoretical and practical importance. This study suggests that financial learning and entrepreneurial skills pioneer the development of biotech firms by having a higher speed of innovation. Regarding its implications for public authorities, the substantial need to promote FL and ES is highlighted. Thus public policies extend entrepreneurial skills and financing knowledge by improving the decision-making process. © 2023 ThinkBiotech LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper extends the theory of fuzzy diseases predictions and bankruptcy likelihood in order to improve cause detection by introducing Fuzzy Entropy, as an alternative measure for the analysis of causes. In this case, the fuzzy entropy allows to assess a level of uncertainty in the expert's valuation of the firm and the visualization of certain problems in experts’ valuation levels, which can cause higher levels of relative uncertainty in the analysis of causes in business diagnosis. Also, with this extension, the model can be useful to develop suitable computer systems for monitoring companies’ problems, warning of failures and facilitating decision-making. © 2024 Old City Publishing, Inc.

AB  - Chinese P2P lending platforms have an astonishing default rate of 87.2% based on data available in 2019, which indicates the seriousness of the problem this industry faces. Insufficient regulation has resulted in generation of risky services, such as margin finance in 2015 for stock markets and zero down-payment mortgages in 2016 for real estate buyers. Such services are prone to resulting in dramatic losses to investors with the following potential causes: adverse selection caused by information asymmetry of the P2P platform operators, lack of financial knowledge or expertise of the investors, insufficient regulation on P2P platforms, and changes in policies related to stock and real estate markets. Does “Too Big to Fail” (TBTF) apply to Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms in China? Are platforms with large Transaction Volumes or large Total Loan Size safer? This paper aims at answering such questions and identifies other factors that have led to defaults of such P2P lending platforms. In order to generate a more robust model that covers a wider range of factors, we adopt two approaches: Failure Prediction Model and Decomposition Methods. The reason why we have adopted this approach was that the factors that caused failure of such P2P platforms were very complicated and varied in nature. Failure Prediction Model is mainly based on the disclosed transaction or financial data. However, Decomposition Method aims at identification of sources of problem from different groups of factors, such as internal operations and external business environment. Also, another contribution of our research is that the data sets that we have used are from three different sources, which provide us a more comprehensive picture about the risks faced by such P2P lending firms. This study provides evidence that the bond yield, which reflects the liquidity level of the market, is the major reason for P2P platforms’ failure during the research period. Our results also indicate that apart from the size-related factors one also needs to answer the question - “Were platforms with larger Transaction Volumes and Total Loan Sizes safer?” The style factors like the interest rate and ownership, the timing factors like loan maturity and bond yield, and the selectivity factors like popularity are found to be even more significant. Hopefully, our findings could contribute academically to the existing literature in the credit risk estimation of online P2P lending platforms and provide practical support for development of a more effective risk monitoring system for online P2P lending platforms. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Firm innovation relies heavily on financing, which is why it is a hot topic in the fields of finance and innovation management. Organizations can make strategic investments in production factors to develop competitive advantages because they have access to financial resources. This study investigated how financial literacy, innovativeness, and environmental sustainability influence the sustainability of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This was set as the primary objective in order to better understand the nature of the impact of financial literacy and innovation on the sustainability of SME firms. To test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied using data collected from 300 small businesses firms in China. The results revealed that financial literacy and innovativeness significantly influence small firms’ sustainability. Additionally, social inclusion significantly affects small firms’ sustainability, and sequentially has a significant effect on their performance. Research findings suggested that small businesses incorporate sustainability models into their operations and enhance financial knowledge in order to maintain sustainability. Copyright © 2022 Tang.

AB  - Inclusive finance is a core concept of finance that makes various financial products and services accessible and affordable to all individuals and businesses, especially those excluded from the formal financial system. One of the leading forces affecting people's ability to access financial services in rural areas is financial literacy. This study investigated the impacts of financial knowledge on financial access through banking, microfinance, and fintech access using the Bangladesh rural population data. We employed three econometrics models: logistic regression, probit regression, and complementary log–log regression to examine whether financial literacy significantly affects removing the barriers that prevent people from participating and using financial services to improve their lives. The empirical findings showed that knowledge regarding various financial services factors had significant impacts on getting financial access. Some variables such as profession, income level, knowledge regarding depositing and withdrawing money, and knowledge regarding interest rate highly affected the overall access to finance. The study's results provide valuable recommendations for the policymaker to improve financial inclusion in the developing country context. A comprehensive and long-term education program should be delivered broadly to the rural population to make a big stride in financial inclusion, a key driver of poverty reduction and prosperity boosting. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The development of information technology encourages the growth of technology in the financial sector (financial technology). Financial technology is an innovative business model and new technology that has the potential to transform the financial services industry. In this study, the author will discuss cryptocurrency which is the result of the development of financial technology. Although cryptocurrency technology is considered as one of the secure online integrated payment systems in financial transactions, cryptocurrencies are considered to be still not ready to face uncertain economic movements and do not yet have an adequate legal basis. Therefore, this study aims to find out what factors influence the young generation in making decisions to invest in cryptocurrencies and how prepared Indonesia's young generation is to face the advancement of financial technology (cryptocurrency). In this study, financial knowledge and locus of control will be used as independent variables, financial behavior as a moderating variable and financial decision as a dependent variable in examining factors that influence the young generation in making decisions. We use a questionnaire survey that provides input on the response of the young generation on this matter. We took a sample of the young generation with an age range of 18-20 years as many as 75 respondents who were chosen randomly. The results of this study indicate that the factors that influence the young generation in making decisions to invest in cryptocurrencies are locus of control which has been moderated by financial behavior and the majority of respondents invest in cryptocurrencies because they follow trends or just for Fomo, more mature preparation is needed in the face of advances in financial technology. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.

AB  - This study addresses African-Americans’ retirement readiness and the factors that contribute to African Americans being prepared or not prepared for retirement. Specifically, this study explores the relationship between educated African-Americans’ financial literacy and their retirement readiness. To analyze this relationship, a binary logistic regression model was fitted to primary data collected from graduates, professors, and business professionals associated with a liberal arts university located in the southeastern USA. The researchers found that educated African-Americans who are more financially literate are more likely to be ready for retirement versus educated African-Americans who are less financially literate. This finding suggests that education does not equate to financial literacy. Moreover, millennials are more likely to be prepared for retirement compared to other age groups, and those who are single and those who do not work full time are less likely to be prepared for retirement. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Cryptocurrencies have ballooned into a billion-dollar business. To inform regulations aimed at protecting consumers vulnerable to suboptimal financial decisions, we investigate crypto investment intentions as a function of consumer gender, financial overconfidence (greater subjective relative to objective financial knowledge), and the Big Five personality traits. Study 1 (N = 126) found that people believe each Big Five personality trait as well as consumer gender and financial overconfidence to predict consumers' crypto investment intentions. Study 2 (N = 1741) revealed that less than 1 in 10 consumers from a nationally representative sample (Norway) are willing to invest in crypto. However, the proportion of male (vs. female) consumers considering such investments is more than twice as large, with less (vs. more) agreeable and less (vs. more) conscientious, but more (vs. less) open and more (vs. less) financially overconfident consumers also being increasingly inclined to consider crypto investments. Financial overconfidence, agreeableness, and conscientiousness mediate the link between consumer gender and crypto investment intentions. These results hold after accounting for a theoretically relevant confounding factor (financial self-efficacy). Together, this research offers novel implications for marketing theory and practice that help understand the observed gender differences in consumers' crypto investments. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Background Instances of violating MyData guidelines to promote MyData services have been discovered in the financial industry. Given the complexity of financial technologies and procedures, designers in companies strive to create convenient and comprehensible user experiences. However, such designs may be classified as “dark patterns” according to established research standards. This study aims to investigate whether users perceive existing services, which are classified according to dark pattern criteria, as beneficial or harmful. Given the unique characteristics of MyData services, this research considers financial knowledge and personal data protection awareness as factors that may influence users’ perceptions of dark patterns. To ensure a neutral perspective, we conduct an education session on dark patterns. By comparing users’ opinions before and after the session, this study seeks to identify the extent to which people can accept designs that are categorized as dark patterns and determine the effectiveness of dark patterns education. Methods To conduct the experiment, we initially referred to the criteria of dark patterns used in previous studies and identified cases of dark pattern designs being utilized in MyData services. Then, we categorized them into seven patterns. During the experiment, we provided participants with items that could assess their financial knowledge and awareness of personal information protection. Participants evaluated their recognition level after reviewing the reclassified dark pattern screens. Afterward, we presented educational materials that contained explanatory comments on the positive and negative aspects of the design on the same screen and re-evaluated the recognition level. To analyze the difference in recognition levels, we employed a paired samples t-test to test the hypotheses and derived additional findings and discussion points. Results The main research results are as follows. First, significant differences were observed in the recognition of dark patterns before and after the educational intervention among user groups with low financial knowledge or high/low awareness of personal information protection in MyData services. Second, following the educational intervention, there was a tendency for the recognition level of dark patterns to decrease, indicating the effectiveness of the education in raising awareness of the harmful nature of dark patterns. Third, user groups with low financial knowledge or low awareness of personal information protection tended to perceive dark patterns as beneficial when compared to other groups, even after the educational intervention. Fourth, some dark patterns showed significant differences across multiple user groups, and certain patterns were still perceived as beneficial even after the educational intervention. Conclusions Based on the findings of this study, we aim to encourage active discussions on educating individuals on dark patterns to prevent and raise awareness of the potential harm to personal data among users of financial services. In addition, by categorizing the beneficial and harmful aspects of dark patterns, new guidelines can be developed to enhance usability while supporting companies’ activities, which will be beneficial for both businesses and users. This study sheds light on the analysis of dark patterns in MyData services and the importance of awareness of dark patterns according to financial knowledge and personal data protection levels. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which permits unrestricted educational and noncommercial use, provided the original work is properly cited

AB  - The study aims at assessing the gap in knowledge, perception and practice of managing personal finance among undergraduate students in India. A combined measure of self-rating and actual financial knowledge and practice on credit cards, investments, loans and insurance are recorded to analyze the behavioral gap. A structured questionnaire was administered on 1500 undergraduate students, selected using a purposive sampling technique. Simultaneous study on 50 experts to record their opinion and experience in identifying teachable opportunities, gaps in the current system and the best methodology for imparting financial literacy program for non-finance students revealed the best practices. The best practices suggested are evaluated based on its capacity to target, interact, access, scalable and its effectiveness at university level. It is evident from the study that there is a larger lacuna in imparting the basic financial knowledge for practical management of personal finance to non-business students and the teachable opportunities are unidentified at university level. © 2015, (Publisher).

AB  - Objective: Our purpose was to describe the financial knowledge, habits and attitudes of chiropractic students. Methods: We designed a cross-sectional survey to measure basic financial knowledge, current financial habits, risk tolerance, and beliefs about future income among 250 students enrolled in business courses at one US chiropractic college. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. Results: We received 57 questionnaires (23% response rate). Most respondents would accumulate over $125,000 in student loan debt by graduation. Financial knowledge was low (mean 77%). Most respondents (72%) scored as average financial risk takers. Chiropractic students reported recommended short-term habits such as having checking accounts (90%) and health insurance (63%) or paying monthly bills (88%) and credit cards (60%). Few saved money for unplanned expenses (39%) or long-term goals (26%), kept written budgets (32%), or had retirement accounts (19%). Conclusion: These chiropractic students demonstrated inadequate financial literacy and did not engage in many recommended financial habits. © JCCA 2014.

AB  - Using social construction theory, associations between student and classroom characteristics and high school students' financial knowledge and behavior acquisition after studying a financial planning curriculum were examined. Prior to curriculum study, Whites, those growing up in a farm family business, and those who were working had higher financial knowledge; male and female knowledge differed by content. After curriculum study, females, those not growing up in a farm family business, and those who were not working gained most from curriculum study. While Whites, those who were working, and males exhibited more positive behaviors prior to curriculum study, after curriculum study, students living in states having financial mandates and those who did not grow up in a farm family business increased their positive behaviors most. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background: The importance of professional competence (PC) in business administration (BA) has increased considerably in many industrial nations over the past several years. However, while economic competence is being assessed internationally in the Assessment of Higher Learning Outcomes (AHELO) study, the modeling and assessment of PC in BA needs more research, particularly from an international perspective. We defined and modeled the construct of PC in BA based on theoretical analyses and evidence from international studies and, for the assessment, focused on knowledge of BA as a key facet of PC in BA. In this article, we describe the developed structural model of knowledge in BA and present the specifications and findings for the example of financial knowledge (FK). In the model, we describe cognitive levels of FK in relation to subject content and subject didactics. Moreover, we discuss influence factors on FK. Method: Subsequently, we present the results from the empirical analyses on FK. Assessment data was gathered using an adapted and further developed international test instrument. The sub-sample for the analyses comprised 773 students from 23 institutions of higher education in Germany. We used item response models to confirm the theoretically modeled levels and multilevel modeling to analyze influence factors on FK. Results: The Rasch model showed a good fit to the data and confirmed the theoretically modeled levels. From the perspective of vocational education and training, we investigated the extent to which FK is influenced positively by commercial vocational training completed prior to higher education studies. We analyzed this while controlling personal influence factors, such as mother tongue and gender, and study-related influence factors such as completion of subject-related courses at university, number of semesters, and type of institution of higher education. We found that prior commercial vocational training affected FK even when the other influence factors were controlled. Conclusions: These results support the assumption that during dual vocational education and training students acquire professional knowledge and gain experience related to their job or practical training that are not or cannot be taught in this way at universities or universities of applied sciences.

AB  - Personal financial satisfaction arises from the ability to manage financial resources effectively. Individuals today face great challenges in managing their finances due to increased exposure to marketing activities, stemming from increased competition for consumers’ money. However, even though various business courses comprise financial management content that focuses on the importance of managing and maximising wealth, students express little concern about their financial status, future wealth and retirement planning, This article reports on a study conducted in South Africa to determine African Generation Y students’ attitudes towards personal financial planning. The South African Generation Y cohort, defined as individuals born between 1986 and 2005, accounted for an estimated 38 percent of the country’s population in 2013. In terms of race, the African portion of this cohort accounted for approximately 83 percent of this cohort and 32 percent of the total South African population. Therefore, the significant size of the African Generation Y market makes them salient to industry professionals, including financial institutions and those involved in financial management, especially in financial planning. Despite the importance of this market segment, their consumer behaviour remains under researched in general, specifically concerning their attitudes towards personal financial planning. In order to address this shortfall in the literature, a structured, selfadministered questionnaire was used to gather data on personal financial planning attitudes from a non-probability convenience sample of 500 African Generation Y students across two South African public higher education institutions’ campuses located in the Gauteng province. The collected data was analysed using t-tests. According to the results, African Generation Y students have a significant positive attitude towards personal financial planning. This article concludes with recommendations for financial institutions, including banks, insurance- and investment companies regarding effective ways to convey financial knowledge and product information to deliver improved financial service to this segment. © 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

AB  - We examined the construct of financial wellness and its relationship to personal wellbeing, with a focus on the role of financial literacy. Gender comparisons are made using a structural equation modeling analysis including personal wellbeing, financial satisfaction, financial status, financial behavior, financial attitude, and financial knowledge. Males ranked higher in financial satisfaction and financial knowledge whereas females ranked higher in personal wellbeing. Joo's (2008) concept of financial wellness as multidimensional is supported though the result is improved when a causal model of sub-components is estimated. The relationship of all variables to personal wellbeing is mediated by financial satisfaction, with gender differences: In females the main source of financial satisfaction is financial status whereas in males it is financial knowledge. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Using data collected by the National Financial Capability Study, a survey recently commissioned by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, this paper investigates the correlations between subjectively and objectively assessed measures of financial knowledge, and the probability of having savings adequate to cover 3 months of typical expenses. Results indicate that households who are more financially knowledgeable or more confident in their financial ability are significantly more likely to report having emergency funds. These findings support the growing literature on the relationship between financial knowledge and economic behaviors and have wide policy implications. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.
