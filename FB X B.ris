AB  - The digital economy has a significant influence on the financial behavior of enterprises. According to the panel data of A-share listed enterprises in the manufacturing industry from 2010 to 2020, we discuss how manufacturing enterprises allocate their financial assets in the process of digitalization from the perspective of operating profit and risk taking. The results reveal that ICT investment significantly reduces financial asset allocation, while digital transformation improves the financial asset allocation of manufacturing enterprises. Because ICT investment increases operating profit from the main business, manufacturing enterprises reduce the allocation of short-term and long-term financial assets. We thus propose two phenomena: precautionary saving and substitutional investment. As digital transformation increases risk taking, financial assets are elevated by manufacturing enterprises for the precautionary saving motivation, boosting the short-term financial assets in their portfolios. These findings are further supported by the heterogeneity of innovation characteristics and ownership. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Recently, a Bayesian approach has been widely used to infer parameters of complex models from finite sample data in business, finance, social and physical sciences. Bayesian applications in finance literature are growing due to their exposure to prior beliefs that macroeconomic variables influence the financial behavior of customers, investors and firm's performance. This paper employs a robust Bayesian analysis model to capture a complex multi-dimensional process and estimate the required parameters of interest. It considers a class of prior distributions for the parameters that is a mixture of natural conjugate base priors and a contamination class of prior distributions. The conditional type-II maximum likelihood posterior densities and posterior means for the coefficients vector and autoregressive parameter are derived for the coefficients vector and autoregressive parameter of interest. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)method has been used for obtaining the marginal posterior densities and Bayes estimators for various combinations of the parameters. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated on Indian financial firms’ balance sheets data between 1992 to 2015 to observe the sensitivity of the proposed model. The result shows most of the corporate performance variables are significantly affecting the firm's profitability with the exception of interest coverage ratio. © 2019

AB  - The study applies a GMM technique to a panel data sample of 2,093 private Spanish companies, 1,434 of which are family firms to investigate whether or not the capital structure of family business differs from that of non-family firms. The results show that family firms are more indebted than non-family firms. Moreover, the factors that have an influence on capital structure have different impacts on family firms and non-family firms. Furthermore, our findings also reveal that the financial structure (leverage ratio) of family firms changes with the size of the business and the firm’s life cycle, and that the variables that explain the financial behaviour of the family firms have different levels of importance, depending on the size of the business and the firm’s life cycle. © 2017, Faculty of Social Sciences.

AB  - From the psychology and religious perspective, there is a growing faith that religiosity influences financial behavior. Most available literature has only discussed religiosity as the antecedents of investment behavior in various contexts. There are no yet inquiries in financial behavior that examine the role of religiosity as a moderating variable. Hence, this study has provided novelty by testing the role of religiosity as a moderating variable in the relationship between risk tolerance and financial behavior. The population of this study was Muslim SMEs owners in Banyumas Regency, Indonesia. Ninety-one respondents were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. This study found that risk tolerance and religiosity variables had a positive and significant effect on financial behavior. The interaction effect of the religiosity variable would weaken risk tolerance on financial behavior. This research had significant implications for the development of financial behavior theory in SMEs and developing SMEs. © 2021, SRAC - Romanian Society for Quality. All rights reserved.

AB  - Behavioral finance is an area or sub-discipline of behavioral economics that examines the real financial behavior and decision-making of people, including the knowledge of psychology and sociology. The objective of this paper was to identify and investigate the impact of significant cognitive, psychological and emotional factors affecting the financial decision-making of the shareholders of woodworking and furniture manufacturing and trading enterprises. This could lead to the design of decision-making concepts which take into account not only cognitive but also psychological and emotional factors and their influences on decision-making process, which could positively affect the sustainable development of the aforementioned types of enterprises. The mapping of the addressed issue was carried out by means of an empirical survey in the practice of the Slovak woodworking and furniture manufacturing and trading enterprises in the form of a questionnaire. The results of the survey were evaluated by descriptive, graphical and mathematical-statistical methods. Conclusions and recommendations were formulated based on the identification of key behavioral aspects (knowledge, security, freedom and sadness), the implementation of which could contribute to eliminating negative deviations and errors in the financial decision-making process of shareholders of woodworking and furniture manufacturing and trading enterprises. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - We use two general equilibrium models to explain why changes in the external economic environment result in pro-cyclical aggregate dividend payout behavior. Both models that we consider endogenize low elasticity of investment. The first model incorporates capital adjustment costs, while the second one assumes that risk-averse managers maximize their own objective function rather than shareholder wealth. We show that, while both models generate pro-cyclical aggregate dividends, a feature consistent with the observed business-cycle pattern of payouts from well-diversified portfolios, the second model provides a more likely explanation for this effect. Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating agency conflicts when considering the relationship between the external economic environment and the financial behavior of businesses. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This research examines the impact of an external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, an internal locus of control, and social media on financial well-being, focusing on the mediating role of financial behavior. Financial wellbeing can be improved by reducing the external locus of control, increasing individual financial self-efficacy and financial literacy, and using social media appropriately. Furthermore, the importance of financial behavior is emphasized by the indirect effects of external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, and social media on financial wellbeing. The study features an online survey questionnaire with 438 respondents. The relationships were investigated using PLS-SEM. According to the study’s findings, financial influencers are social media data variables that significantly affect financial behavior. These findings can assist policymakers, and business leaders in understanding the most influential factors affecting Indonesia’s financial wellbeing. Furthermore, the Indonesian government encourages the younger generation to improve its literacy index through public financial education. Research into financial wellbeing is critical because it aligns with the government’s goal of improving the stability and health of the population’s finances. Individuals can maintain financial control, allowing them to meet financial goals, manage unexpected expenses during emergencies, deal with financial problems, and enjoy life. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper documents how extensive economic education can reduce the risk of getting into financial trouble by comparing people who enter business and economics programs with people who enter other higher education programs. To identify the causal effect, I exploit GPA admission thresholds that quasi-randomize applicants near the thresholds into different higher education programs. I find that admission to an economics program reduces the probability of loan default and delinquency by one half. This large reduction is associated with changes in financial behavior, but it is not associated with differences in the level or stability of people's income.

AB  - Digital financial literacy is projected to become an increasingly significant part of education in the digital age, both in India and around the world. To create programs to raise the level of financial literacy among people in the digital age, it is essential to measure the level of digital financial literacy among various societal segments. The study aims to provide a validated tool for measuring the digital financial literacy of individuals in developing countries, like India and also to analyze the significance of its key dimensions. Also, the level of DFL among respondents in the National Capital Territory (India) was measured. The study adopted the widely used scale development paradigm provided by Churchill (1979). The empirical data was collected using two online surveys with 145 (N1) and 323 (N2) sample sizes, which were analyzed with factor analysis using International Business Machines (IBM) Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) and IBM SPSS Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) statistical software. The proposed digital financial literacy scale consists of twenty-two statements under five key aspects of digital financial literacy, which are: Digital Financial Risk and Control; Basic Digital Financial Knowledge; Advanced Digital Financial Knowledge; Digital Financial Attitude, and Digital Financial Behavior. The proposed Digital Financial Literacy Scale demonstrated sound psychometric properties, encouraging its future usage for assessing the digital financial literacy of individuals. Furthermore, it can help organizations and concerned authorities compare individuals' digital financial literacy levels pre- and post-implementation of Digital Financial Literacy Awareness campaigns. © 2024 Sociedade Portguesa de Estomatologia e Medicina Dentaria.

AB  - This research aims to analyze the relationship between financial literacy variables and financial inclusion, the relationship between financial literacy variables and financial technology, and the relationship between financial technology variables and financial inclusion. The analysis of this research is to learn more about how financial literacy and the use of financial technology influence financial inclusion. This type of research is associative quantitative. Next, the relationship between these variables is explained using statistical formulas. Consequently, the term for this research is “quantitative research”. The study population is the number of people who use financial services. For this sampling, the purposive random sampling method was used. The following criteria are determined in sampling: 1) Minimum age 17 years, this is intended to take the minimum age standard in sampling and is considered capable of understanding the contents of the questionnaire statements. 2) Have ever used financial services. In this study, 11 question items were used to measure 3 variables, so this study used the largest range, namely 231 respondents. The intervention variable will be used as a reference for the Partial Least Square (PLS) method to analyze this research data. This study uses a causal model (causal modelling, relationships, and influence) or path analysis. The hypothesis that will be discussed in this research is tested using the Structural Equation Model (SEM), which is operated with Smart PLS. The results of this research show that financial literacy has a positive and significant impact on financial inclusion in society. Financial literacy has a positive and significant impact on financial technology. financial technology has a positive and significant impact on financial inclusion, financial technology can offset the impact of financial literacy on financial inclusion. The results of this research are used as input for the community so that they pay more attention to their internal human resources related to financial products that can be used for investment. With knowledge of the right financial products, it is hoped that they can create good financial behaviour so that an awareness of the importance of carrying out good financial planning. For financial institutions, it is hoped that this can increase easy access to financial products and services, in particular credit for businesses as additional capital for the community. © 2024 by author(s).

AB  - We organise a field experiment with smallholder farmers in Rwanda to measure the impact of financial literacy training on financial knowledge and behaviour. The training increased financial literacy of participants, changed their savings and borrowing behaviour and had a positive effect on the new business start-up. However, it failed to have a significant (short-term) impact on income. Using a two-stage regression framework, we identify enhanced financial literacy as one of the important factors explaining behavioural changes. We also test whether financial knowledge spillovers from trained farmers to their peers in local village banks but find no evidence for that. © 2014 Royal Economic Society

AB  - As a primary external criterion for corporate financial information disclosure, the audit opinion delivers important signals to the capital market and social public. Consequently, investors and regulators highly value audit opinions. This induces corporate managers to engage in audit opinion shopping behavior. Additionally, the incentive to audit opinion shopping varies depending on the internal and external operational environment. Therefore, institutional investors ’ site visits are an important way to participate in corporate governance. They can serve as information intermediaries by revealing inside information and can raise the awareness of the regulators and the investing public to possibly affect managers’ audit opinion shopping behavior. However, there is little literature about how institutional investors’ site visits affect audit opinion shopping behavior. On the one hand, the existing literature about the impact of institutional investors’ site visits on financial behavior mainly focuses on information disclosure quality, earnings management, corporate value, and tax avoidance strategies. On the other hand, the existing research about the factors affecting audit opinion shopping behavior mainly focuses on the financial position of the corporate, managers’ risk appetite, internal governance structure, auditor independence, audit fees, media coverage, and external supervision. Theoretically speaking, is the impact of institutional investors ’ site visits on audit opinion shopping behaviors thus shown by the inhibiting effect, or the stimulating effect, or both? This is an important question that has yet to be solved. As a result, this paper takes the “ Information Disclosure Business Memorandum No. 41-Investor Relations Management and its Information Disclosure” issued by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2013 as the research opportunity, and uses data of institutional investors ’ site visits in A-share listed corporates on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange from 2014 to 2018 as the research sample. Following the methods of Gul et al. (2013) and Lennox (2000), this paper develops the audit opinion prediction model and the audit opinion shopping model to empirically explore the impact of institutional investors’ site visits and their outcomes along two possible paths: the stimulation path and the inhibition path. The results are as follows: First, institutional investors ’ site visits decrease the probability of modified audit opinions while boosting audit report aggressiveness to encourage audit opinion shopping. Furthermore, the greater the number of participating institutions and the more frequent the surveys, the more obvious the phenomenon for managers to engage in audit opinion shopping by changing auditors. In a word, institutional investors ’ site visits can create a considerable incentive for managers to engage in audit opinion shopping activity, which is known as the “stimulating effect. ” Second, the analysis of how managers engage in audit opinion shopping reveals that managers prefer small-to-medium-sized accounting firms to achieve their purposes. This is because these accounting firms are less stringent than large firms in terms of operation management, regulations, auditor ethical standards, and legal compliance. Small-to-medium-sized accounting firms, therefore, are more easily “ persuaded” to engage in audit opinion shopping activities. Third, the analysis of opinion shopping incentives reveals that the stimulating effect is particularly obvious in corporations with high operational risk or high levels of earnings management. Under the stimulating effect, the incentive for managers to engage in audit opinion shopping is to conceal “adverse singles” about earnings management as well as operational risk, so they can whitewash disappointing financial statements, alleviate investors’ concerns, and maintain the corporate’ s performance in the capital market. Finally, the research conclusions still hold after a series of robust tests regarding the mitigation of endogenous problems, the exclusion of alternative explanations, and the impact of auditor rotation systems. This study makes three contributions by exploring the impact of institutional investors ’ site visits on audit opinion shopping behavior. First, it provides answers to the controversy over this issue in theoretical as well as practical circles, and it expands theoretical research on the economic consequences of institutional investors ’ site visits. Second, it clarifies how managers engage in audit opinion shopping under the stimulating effect, and it explores the managers’ incentive to conceal adverse signals. As a result, it fills a gap in existing research and provides new empirical evidence for theoretical research on the incentive of audit opinion shopping. Third, this research begins and ends in practice, so it provides a scientific basis and an empirical reference for accounting firms to strengthen derivative risk management and for regulators to improve external governance of institutional investors’ site visits. © (2024), (Zhejiang University).

AB  - As financial technology and consumer behavior in Indonesia evolve, research that assesses their level of risk in debt management is required. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between personality traits and other factors, such as effective financial decision making, attitude toward debt, locus of control, and financial literacy, in influencing a person's response in unexpected situations and causing them into debt, as a lot happened when covid-19 hit. Our data from an online questionnaire revealed that personality has a significant relationship to risk in debt management; additionally, attitude toward debt and financial behavior significantly affect debt risk. This analysis was obtained through ordinal regression by categorizing respondents into three categories: low, middle, and high-risk debt management. This study has potentially implementation for lenders such as banks or peer-to-peer businesses, regarding the type of people who are most likely to have debt troubles, and also regulators regarding how they can make policies related to borrowing applicants to avoid risky debtor in order to push the non-performing loan (NPL) low.

AB  - Purpose: The objective of this study is to provide a systematic review of the literature on artificial intelligence (AI) in customer-facing financial services, providing an overview of explored contexts and research foci, identifying gaps in the literature and setting a comprehensive agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach: Combining database (i.e. Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO, ScienceDirect) and manual journal search, the authors identify 90 articles published in Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) journals for investigation, using the TCCM (Theory, Context, Characteristics and Methodology) framework. Findings: The results indicate a split between data-driven and theory-driven research, with most studies either adopting an experimental research design focused on testing the accuracy and performance of AI algorithms to assist with credit scoring or investigating AI consumer adoption behaviors in a banking context. The authors call for more research building overarching theories or extending existing theoretical perspectives, such as actor networks. More empirical research is required, especially focusing on consumers' financial behaviors as well as the role of regulation, ethics and policy concerned with AI in financial service contexts, such as insurance or pensions. Research limitations/implications: The review focuses on AI in customer-facing financial services. Future work may want to investigate back-office and operations contexts. Originality/value: The authors are the first to systematically synthesize the literature on the use of AI in customer-facing financial services, offering a valuable agenda for future research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to examine gender differences in credit access and credit default. Design/methodology/approach: Using panel data drawn from 917 valid credit borrowers covering the period 2012 to 2015 drawn from among 6,849 study subjects and a national household financial survey (n = 29,500) conducted in China, this study focuses on gender differences in small and micro entrepreneurs’ financial behavior, specifically with respect to credit access and credit default. Findings: The study revealed the following: Women expressed having more barriers to obtaining a business loan than men; gender had a significant effect on women’ credit default; and women were less likely to default a loan than male loan borrowers did. An exploration of the reasons for credit access and default found that female loan applicants were more likely to display a lack of knowledge and confidence in loan application. Originality/value: The study contributes to literature by using the Marxian concept of reification in explaining women and their financial behaviors in China. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: An understanding of financial literacy is important not only for business actors but also for individuals and households; even there is a need to introduce this all-important skill to children early. There is a projection that the financial behavior of the young generation will have a better influence on the global economy than that of the previous generation. Therefore, it is crucial that today’s young generation understands financial literacy. This study aims to measure how digital financial literacy and financial confidence can influence both the financial behavior and financial well-being of the younger generation. Design/methodology/approach: The participants in this study are university students from all over Indonesia. This is a quantitative research project that uses online questionnaires, and the collected data is processed using structural equations mode-partial least squares (SEM-PLS) with the Smart-PLS application. Questionnaires have been distributed and obtained by 353 respondents to be processed by the Smart-PLS application. Finding: The result indicates that digital financial literacy has a significant effect on financial behavior, and financial behavior also has a significant effect on financial well-being. Meanwhile, financial confidence influences both financial well-being and financial behavior. Conclusion: This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing information to the public about the importance of digital financial literacy for individuals to control their financial behaviour amidst the rapid growth of financial technology. Furthermore, the research findings are enriched with literature on digital financial literacy, which is still rarely studied. However, a limitation of this study is the fact that the respondents are mainly women. Therefore, there should be further research involving a higher number of respondents and covering a wider research location. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Although the entrepreneurship literature has advanced our understanding of start-up financing, little is known about the mechanisms founders use to finance the beginning of a venture. Drawing upon resource-based view, this study relocates bootstrapping is a strategic choice rather than a necessity. By analysing the financial behaviour of 3,017 new business owners, we reveal owner-financed bootstrapping is a strategic choice rather than a necessity. We also demonstrate related techniques that are used independent of industry, initial capital, financing difficulties, and impeded revenues. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being among businesspersons in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, México. The applied methodology includes confirmatory factor analysis and multiple linear regression models. Our results indicate that financial literacy is related to financial well-being directly through its financial behavior component and inversely through financial attitude. Moreover, financial knowledge was not significantly associated with it. Hence, we propose the following recommendations for businesspeople and entrepreneurs: becoming more involved in healthy financial inclusion and financial literacy practices and inspiring their transition from models focused solely on profits to others considering their self-realization and satisfaction. Its main limitations and implications are the scarcity of data to perform an analysis by industry, its geographical outreach, and its public policy repercussions. Its originality lies in analyzing financial well-being among businesspeople, a topic rarely studied in Mexico. Our conclusions impact the implementation of the financial inclusion policy in Mexico and, therefore, contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas.

AB  - Students of the millennial generation have several characteristics, including being wasteful in their management of money and being highly dependent on information and communication technology. These phenomena mean financial literacy is important for them, in order that they become capable, wise, and efficient individuals who are future-oriented in managing their personal finances. This study aims to create a model for developing the financial management behavior of students. It covers five variables, namely financial behavior, financial attitude, financial knowledge, social media exposure, and peer influence. By using purposive sampling and a five-point Likert scale questionnaire, this study collected data from 327 students spread across several universities in Indonesia. The results of the descriptive analysis show that the students’ financial management behavior (FMB), financial attitude, and financial knowledge are classified as good. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis using the single-composite indicator technique shows that 58% of FMB is influenced by financial exposure from social media, financial attitude, and peer influence. Social media exposure and peer influence take on a strategic nature. Financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial behavior are internal variables related to financial literacy. Further research would need to identify the external variables that have a potential influence on the internal variables of financial literacy. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper assesses the impact of an integrated skills training program given to youth aged 17–25-year-old living under the $2/day poverty line in the cocoa belt region of Ghana. Despite being a leading producer of cocoa and having a burgeoning youth population, it is estimated that the average age of a cocoa farmer in Ghana is greater than 50 years. To introduce young people to cocoa farming and address the potential barriers they face in order to do that; a multi-faceted skills training programme was designed with the ultimate aim of improving and diversifying youth livelihoods. The training had three key components: i) cocoa academies (which includes agricultural practices; life skills and financial literacy); ii) business incubators (including entrepreneurial training, networks, mentoring) and iii) supporting enabling environment (access to land and finance). Combining quasi-experimental methods Propensity Score Matching with Difference in Differences, we estimate the causal effect of the programme on agricultural outcomes (farming, agricultural practices), financial behaviour outcomes (saving practices, mobile banking) and livelihood outcomes (employment, income, poverty likelihood) one year after the completion of training. The results of the impact evaluation suggest that compared to the control group (youth non-participants), youths who participated in the training adopt better agricultural practices (26 percentage points (pp)), cultivate cocoa (24 pp), and are more likely to engage in farming (22 pp). We also find a 28.7% increase in income in the last seven days and hours worked by 12.4%. Youth also increase the use of banks for saving (16 pp), save using mobile money (6.7 pp), the use of Village Savings and Loan Associations (1.7 pp) and, in general, the use of mobile money for both sending and receiving transfers (10.6 pp). The sex-disaggregated sub-sample analysis provides other valuable insights on the intervention. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using rich Italian data for the period 2006–2014, we analyze differences in financial behavior between natives and immigrants in a unified setting covering a wide set of outcomes and including a large set of covariates. We document sizeable gaps between native and immigrant households with respect to wealth holdings and financial decisions. Immigrant household heads hold less net wealth than native along the entire wealth distribution. Immigrant status reduces the likelihood of holding risky assets, housing, mortgages, businesses, and valuables, and it increases the likelihood of financial fragility. Standard regression results are corroborated by a propensity score matching strategy. Years since migration, country of origin, and the pattern of intermarriage also matter. The Great Recession has worsened the condition of immigrants in terms of wealth holdings, home ownership, and financial fragility. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Within the article, the impact of modern digitalization processes on changing household credit behavior is considered. Much attention is paid to defining the essence of digitalization and exploring the features of its impact on the financial services market. Accordingly, the content of household credit behavior and its individual models are examined. This behavior is proposed to be considered as a process of interaction between entities engaged in joint business activities with financial institutions regarding the receipt of temporary financial resources from banking and non-banking institutions with subsequent use to meet their own needs on terms of return, payment, expediency and security. Within the article, basic features that are inherent in both the classic model of obtaining credit services by clients of financial institutions and the new model of lending, which is formed today as a result of the impact of digitalization processes, are defined and systematized. Study of the results of the analysis of current trends in the development of the financial services market made it possible to identify main perspective directions for further transformation of credit household behavior, the process of lending and changing the paradigm of lending to financial institutions. © 2021 Qazvin Islamic Azad University.

AB  - Abstract: The financial and business expansion towards both sides of the Mexico-U.S. border, what could be called the financial diaspora that accompanies Mexican´s migration to the United States and U.S. Corporations to Mexico, has been a process full of nuances and components with different characteristics. Beyond the governments and their migratory and investment policies, the characteristics of the different migrant groups and corporations, the cultural gaps, and the “progressive” institutional changes are subject to a dynamic of survival-assimilation-earnings. Even when powerful trials of organization are observed, a strong and imminent current of regressive institutional change (Veblen) has been gaining space. This article is circumscribed to analyze some key aspects of the financial behavior Mexican migrants to the United States, who have become entrepreneurs, have had. Their enormous limitations of financing are exposed, including the different stages to access credit to the businesses of residents in Mexico and to Mexican businesspeople abroad. The article contends the transformation in financing on both sides of the border has been decisive. © 2020, © 2020, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics.

AB  - The Philippine microenterprises sector is considered as an important stimulus of the country’s economic growth. Previous studies have cited that the struggles faced by micro and small entrepreneurs are brought about by the difficulty in access to finance and the lack of entrepreneurs’ financial literacy and inadequate business acumen. Anchored on the resource-based view theory, the primary objective of this study is to determine the role of financial sophistication, as a human capital resource, and its components, on the link between the strategy–sustainability indicator relationship. Based on a study of 384 micro-entrepreneurs from the National Capital Region, results of the partial least squares–structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) showed that business strategy is positively linked to each of the sustainability indicators, that is, economic, environmental, social, and governance. Conversely, the entrepreneur’s financial sophistication increases the effect of business strategy on each of the sustainability indicators. The results of the study also showed that a positive financial behavior and decision-making style are significant components of financial sophistication. © 2020, Asia-Pacific Social Science Review.

AB  - This paper analyzed the influence of financial behaviors on the duration out of asset poverty while controlling for households' life cycle and demographic characteristics. We found evidence for the existence of structural barriers to asset acquisition. Asset accumulation at or above levels equal to nine-months worth of income at the income-poverty level was important for improving a household's odds of permanently escaping asset poverty, but a linear relationship between asset accumulation and the likelihood of returning to asset poverty did not emerge. Moreover, minimizing debt and diversifying the asset portfolio to include more productive assets were positively related to maintaining assets; but households should also consider the risks associated with portfolio allocations. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This article discusses religiously motivated financial behaviour among young Muslims in Finland. The aim of the article is to provide empirical knowledge of Islam-based views on rejecting interest-based loans and the implications of this among Finnish Muslims. The research questions are: What are the reasons and motivations for rejecting interest-based bank loans? Are there alternative modes of financing? What are the impacts of rejection on personal investments, including in business and housing? Data were obtained from 18 Finnish Muslim entrepreneurs and professionals who reject interest-based bank loans. The data show that their rejection led to the scope for financial arrangements being more limited, and may also have significant implications for their children, the next generation. To circumvent these consequences, those interviewed used some or all of four alternative models for funding: savings; interest-free loans from family and friends; credit circles; and the time-bound, interest-free repayment period on credit cards.  © 2022 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

AB  - Purpose: This paper examines the effect of risk management practices on organizational performance and the mediating role of business model innovation in Nigeria. Design/Methodology/Approach: This research uses quantitative research methods. The paper uses a sample of 83 employees, with data collected through an online questionnaire using a Likert scale using a scale of 5, and the data was analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The stages of data analysis begin with testing the validity and reliability of the instrument, determination and finally testing the hypothesis. Findings: The results showed that practices for risk management and financial performance had a direct and large effect on financial performance. Furthermore, risk management practices are linked to non-financial performance. The result shows that business model innovation has a negative relationship with non-financial performance. It has a positive impact by meaningfully strengthening financial relationships; a partial mediating result was revealed for the relationship between risk management practices and non-financial behaviors. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - In this study, we argue that the financial behaviour of small firms is largely affected by the preferences of the owners, who aim for either independence or wealth maximisation. By analysing survey data from Germany, we observe that owners with a preference for minimising capital costs and maintaining decision-making autonomy deploy more internal financing and raise short-term debt to meet temporary capital requirements. In contrast, owners raise more long-term debt when banks also provide non-financial complementary resources, but they seem to acquire external equity instead of debt to develop new resources and capabilities in collaboration with new co-owners. In light of our findings, we propose a dichotomy of a financial bootstrapping and an added-value pecking-order that small firm owners follow depending on their overarching goal. Overall, our findings indicate that small firm capital acquisition in Germany nowadays reflects more demand-driven rather than supply-constrained behaviour. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Financial illiteracy could pose a significant challenge to micro-entrepreneurs. There is a pressing need to foster financial literacy;, therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine particularly how Islamic financial literacy may enhance their businesses toward achieving financial sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quantitative methods. Three hundred (300) questionnaires were distributed to micro-entrepreneurs in three states in Malaysia, namely, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu. This study used the partial least squares (PLS) analysis using the SmartPLS 3.2. Findings: The study found that the most robust Islamic financial literacy factors are financial behavior, followed by financial knowledge and financial attitude.The outcome of Islamic financial literacy, which is financial sustainability, also demonstrates a positive and significant relationship. Social implications: All variables show a positive and significant relationship toward financial sustainability. Stated differently, micro-entrepreneurs are aware that understanding the basic concepts of Islamic finance may help them achieve long-term financial sustainability Originality/value: This study incorporates Islamic financial concepts into financial literacy while also assessing demographic aspects like years of business operation and education as moderators, which were not considered by previous studies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of the article is theoretical and methodological substantiation of the state and post-war prospects of financial inclusion in Ukraine, taking into account the experience of EU countries. The objectives of the study are as follows: to theoretically sub-stantiate the content and features of financial inclusion, taking into account the experience of EU countries; to assess the current state of financial inclusion; and to outline post-war prospects for the development of financial inclusion in Ukraine. It is argued that the key parameters of financial inclusion are financial well-being, financial behaviour, financial knowledge, and the utilization of financial products, as well as physical access to financial services. Drawing on the experience of EU countries, it is substantiated that creating conditions for free access to financial services for all categories of the population and businesses, as well as their digitalization, contribute to the growth of citizens' income, the simplification of investment mechanisms, and thus the economic development of the country. An assessment of the state of financial inclusion in Ukraine is conducted through online surveys of various categories of citizens. It is determined that Ukrainians feel a strong need for additional sources of income, and the financial situation of the majority of them is extremely unstable. Based on the results of correlation-regression analysis, the priorities of financial inclusion are identified as the level of financial literacy and competency among the population. This will enable them to budget their income and expenses, promote the transformation of savings into investments, and have a positive impact on the post-war recovery of the country's economy. © 2023 by the author(s).

AB  - This research seeks the effect of behavioural and non-behavioural factors of SME's owners and their business characteristic on the financing decisions. Moreover, this research categorized SMEs owners based on their behavioural aspects on establishing a behavioural mapping in SMEs industry. The sample of this research is the informal SMEs owners in Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia. In investigating the relationship of the independent variable on financial decision making, this research employed the hierarchical linear multiple regression model (HLMR) and multiple logistic regression (LR). Furthermore, this research employed cluster analysis for building a behavioural mapping in SMEs industry. This study discovered a significant effect of behavioural aspects of SME's owners on the financing decisions, which is, instead of having significant enforcement on the financing decisions, the non-behavioural aspects were more likely impacted on the SMEs owners' investment decisions. The finding shows that there are three significant groups of SMEs owners in the Surakarta region. The result of this research gives key insights, mainly to the involved stakeholder to keep the sustainability of the SMEs industry. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Background/Objectives: This study aims to examining the urban middle class, namely the specifics of its professional portrait, self-identification and peculiarities of economic behavior. Methods/Statistical Analysis: The methodological basis of the study includes the fundamental ideas of theoretical sociology, comparative analysis, and interdisciplinary approach. The study is based on the conceptual works and the research results of Russian and foreign authors devoted to the analysis of class and gender aspects of social transformations in the countries of Western Europe, America and Russia. Questionnaire surveying of 276 men and 395 women was used as an empirical method. The representativeness of the sampling is provided by maintaining the age and sex structure of the adult population, the proportions between the population size in different districts of the city (sampling error does not exceed 3%). Findings: On the basis of the developed methodology of the study it is revealed that representatives of the urban middle class differ in their attitude to work as compared to other classes. When studying this question it is required to consider instrumental and spiritual aspects. Economic behavior of the middle class is more variable. This is particularly evident in the situation of the need to improve their financial well-being. The middle class is characterized by a considerable rational financial behavior. The essential feature of the urban middle class is the availability of modern investment mentality, what is new in the study of the representatives of the social strata under investigation. Because of their social status, the middle class is interested in social stability, universal respect for the law, therefore, in improvement of the efficiency of the state bodies' work and elimination of various barriers preventing effective business. This confirms the idea that the middle class is the main productive force of society, contributing to the stability of the latter. The investigation of gender aspects should be considered as a novelty of the study. Applications/Improvements: The obtained results allow complementing the notions of self-identification, the middle-class structure, and its economic behavior. These findings can be used in further research on gender issues.

AB  - Many of the factors that motivate individuals occur within the context of the family, and can be influenced through family socialization processes. To better understand the influence family socialization processes may have on financial capabilities and financial behaviors, 334 married couples were sampled. Structural equation modeling was used to examine both direct and indirect associations. Findings indicated direct relationships between materialism and financial strain, between religiosity and determination of needs, and between financial strain and saving for retirement. Indirect relationships were found between materialism and saving for retirement through financial strain. Our study found evidence to support the Family Financial Socialization theoretical framework. Financial counselors may benefit by understanding how couples socialize each other as they prepare for retirement. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The need for Financial Inclusion is globally ascertained by the World Bank through its recent call for Universal Financial Access (UFA) by 2020. According to UFA goals, more than 55 countries have committed to provide access to transaction account through targeted interventions to the economically downtrodden civilians. The formal financial services such as credit services, payment services, business services, and digital services are far more efficient (with respect to wider range, transaction cost, and risk involved) than the informal financial services provided by the money lenders, credit unions, etc. However, several studies have indicated that the Low Income Households (LIH) prefer to use the informal financial services than the formal financial services despite being aware of its limitations. The reasons widely attributed for such behaviour are the objective factors such as income, literacy, accessibility, etc. which is based on the classical finance theories such as Life Cycle Hypothesis and Permanent Income Hypothesis. At the same time, the behavioural finance theories such as Behavioural Life Cycle Hypothesis (BLCH), Regret Theory, Prospect Theory, etc. state that the role of subjective factors (behavioural and psychological factors) also should be deliberated while explaining the financial behaviour pattern of the individual households. The researches in this spectrum are in the early stage of theory-building. Moreover, the majority of the existing research studies in this field are based on the Middle Income Households and Upper Income Households. So the dearth of researches on LIH and on the role of behavioural factors in the financial inclusion is the genesis for this research paper. The research objective of the study is to explore and identify the behavioural and psychological factors that influence the continued usage of the formal financial services among the LIH in India. Convenient sampling method is employed to collect the data from the target group. The statistical tools used in the study are the descriptive statistics and Factor Analysis. The suggested managerial implication of the study is to provide the insights for the policy makers to formulate appropriate financial inclusion strategies, and for the formal financial institutions to mould the behaviourally informed financial services. © IAEME Publication.

AB  - Women’s disadvantage in financial knowledge impedes their progress toward gender equality and produces negative consequences for both individuals and households. To better understand the gender gap in financial knowledge and shed light on possible intervention strategies, this study focused on gender differences in financial knowledge specifically among college students. Drawing on data from the most recent administration of the Study on Collegiate Financial Wellness (SCFW; N = 18,107) among current college students from 38 public four-year institutions, we investigated the gender financial knowledge gap and paid particular attention to the roles of family financial socialization, financial education, and financial behaviors. We identified a sizable gender gap in financial knowledge, even after controlling for other potential factors. OLS regression models and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analyses showed that financial education—indicated by majoring in Business and STEM fields and formal financial courses in high school—was most related to the gender gap in financial knowledge scores. Hands-on financial behaviors were positively associated with financial knowledge acquisition, particularly for female students. In addition, the family socialization process was largely not associated with students’ financial knowledge scores or the gender knowledge gap. Based on these findings, we discussed potential intervention strategies for promoting financial knowledge and reducing the gender gap among and beyond college students. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: The capacity of a business to operate and grow depends on its capital, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). However, access to capital sources depends on many factors such as collateral assets, business plans requiring loans, the social relations of business owners, etc. This study identifies factors affecting SMEs' access to capital in Vietnam. Design/Methodology/Approach: A typical survey was conducted on 450 SMEs in Vietnam, and structural model analysis methods were employed through PLS-SEM software to analyze the data. Findings: Research results show that there are nine groups of factors affecting the ability of SMEs in Vietnam to access capital ranked from high to low level of influence, including (i) operational characteristics of the business, (ii) financial reporting, (iii) financial behaviour of enterprises, (iv) social relations of enterprises, (v) capability of the enterprise, (vi) production and business plan of the enterprise, (vii) ability to adapt to the risks of the enterprise, (viii) characteristics of the business owner and the lowest is institutional environment. Conclusion: Regression analysis proved to be useful in identifying nine groups of elements that impact SMEs' access to capital in Vietnam. The study has proposed management implications to improve access to capital for SMEs in Vietnam. Research Limitations and Implications: The study selected samples based on the principle of random convenience, so the study's sample does not represent all SMEs in Vietnam according to the distribution of regions and territories where the businesses are located. Practical Implications: This research has practical significance in supporting managers at SMEs to make decisions to improve access to capital for businesses contributing to sustainable business development. Contribution to the Literature: This research makes a significant contribution to the field of practical research on capital and capital access for SMEs in Vietnam. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Using a risky-choice framing paradigm, we investigated (a) the extent to which psychopathic features shape behavioral responses to potential losses vs. potential gains and (b) how these relations bear on real-world economic decision-making in a community sample (N = 475). Associations among psychopathic features, risk-seeking, sensitivity to framing, and financial practices were also examined. Disinhibition manifested positive relations with risk-seeking and maladaptive financial practices, whereas boldness manifested positive relations with risk-seeking and adaptive financial practices. Individuals high in disinhibition and/or meanness were significantly less likely to endorse risk seeking in negative frames. Results provisionally suggest boundary conditions for framing effects; in particular, certain psychopathic traits may render individuals modestly less susceptible to framing or bias them towards risk-taking in positive frames. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - One of the challenges faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is maintaining the sustainability of business activities in terms of good financial management. The problem is that knowledge of SMEs is inferior compared with that of large companies. Financial management education is becoming increasingly important as the market develops and demographics, economics and policies change. Previous studies demonstrate a relationship between financial conditions and economic growth. Research on financial behaviour in SMEs is related to several aspects, namely, overconfidence, heuristics and risk perception. The present research uses quantitative methods and factor analysis with 13 indicators. Questionnaires are sent to 432 SMEs in the creative industries in Bandung City. Results reveal that from 13 indicators of financial behaviour, nine can be analysed further. The nine indicators are divided into internal and external factors that shape the financial behaviour of SMEs in the creative industries in Bandung City. Internal factors are based on the self-ability of the business actor, whereas external factor are aspects that are beyond the control of the business actor. Theoretically, this study recommends further research to deeply analyse the factors that shape the financial behaviour of SMEs in the creative industries. Practically, this study highlights the need for education and literacy to strengthen financial behaviour of creative industry entrepreneurs. Copyright © 2020 GMP Press and Printing.

AB  - We examined the construct of financial wellness and its relationship to personal wellbeing, with a focus on the role of financial literacy. Gender comparisons are made using a structural equation modeling analysis including personal wellbeing, financial satisfaction, financial status, financial behavior, financial attitude, and financial knowledge. Males ranked higher in financial satisfaction and financial knowledge whereas females ranked higher in personal wellbeing. Joo's (2008) concept of financial wellness as multidimensional is supported though the result is improved when a causal model of sub-components is estimated. The relationship of all variables to personal wellbeing is mediated by financial satisfaction, with gender differences: In females the main source of financial satisfaction is financial status whereas in males it is financial knowledge. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - International trade frictions have changed the business environment of enterprises. However, how do these changes influence the behavioral decisions of enterprises, and will this further affect enterprise competitiveness? Exploring these questions will help determine the influencing mechanism of external negative impacts, such as international trade frictions, on the competitiveness of entity enterprises. In this study, the influences of China-U.S. trade friction, which served as an exogenous research event, on the competitiveness of entity enterprises were empirically analyzed via a difference-in-difference (DID) model with semiannual report information of Chinese nonfinancial A-share listed companies in 2016 to 2020 as research samples. Research results show that the China-U.S. trade friction promotes enterprises to enlarge their financial asset investment by changing the business environment of enterprises. Moreover, this friction further weakens the enterprise competitiveness, an essential element of industrial investments. As revealed by further heterogeneity analysis, the China-U.S. trade friction has generated heterogenous influences on enterprise competitiveness in the aspects of investment motives, industry, competition status, and internal governance mechanism. In this study, two types of enterprise competitiveness elements—environment and resources—were included into the same research framework, and the category of theoretical research on the connotation of enterprise competitiveness was expanded. Moreover, this research provided new scenes and evidence for identifying the causal relationships of the impacts of exogenous negative events with the financial behaviors and competitiveness of entity enterprises, Furthermore, it rendered countermeasure paths and policy suggestions for scientifically coping with international trade frictions and enhancing the competitiveness of entity enterprises.

AB  - Background: Women have generally lower levels of financial literacy than their male counterparts, regardless of country of origin. This financial literacy gender gap makes women more vulnerable to the effects of pandemics, like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Aim: This study sought to examine financial literacy competencies of women in agribusiness and their financial experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Setting: The study was carried out in five agricultural districts namely, Gweru, Masvingo, Mutoko, Mount Darwin, and Mutare. The districts represented Zimbabwean agricultural regions. Methods: An embedded mixed methods research design was adopted where both qualitative and quantitative data were collected for analysis. Data were successfully collected from 216 women in agribusiness and follow-up interviews were conducted with 15 informants. Results: Women in agribusiness have poor financial literacy competencies. Most women in agribusiness practised only a range of 2–3 good financial behaviours out of the eight examined concepts, with only 10% scoring above the minimum expected score of six. During the pandemic, women in agribusiness lost income and failed to take care of household and business expenses. Conclusion: Women in agribusiness do not practise vital financial literacy competencies required for financial wellbeing and financial resilience. Therefore, the study recommends the implementation of training programmes that capacitate women with basic financial literacy competencies such as budgeting, saving, and retirement planning. Contribution: Financial literacy competencies were conceptualised together with financial experiences during a pandemic for the first time. More so, in the agribusiness sector which is crucial for economic development. © 2023. The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: The Turkish economy has gone through multiple economic crises, marked on the one hand by a volatile trend in the national financial system, and on the other, by the introduction of credit cards and payment facilities for consumer goods that are extremely easy to obtain. Objective: Inspired by previous research on saving attitudes, motivations, and behavior, this study explores the perceptions of consumption conducted using credit, either in the form of referred monthly payments or credit cards in the Turkish context. Method: To analyze the possible relations between saving attitudes, behaviors and new payment methods, a survey was conducted in Istanbul, with a convenience sample of independent professionals, managers and executives, and small business owners (n = 173). Their attitudes and behavior toward saving, buying on installment, credit card use and debt were combined with measures of self-reported control over spending. Results: Results show that self-reported control variables have some effects on the relationship between saving attitudes and actual saving behavior, concurring with Ajzen's model of planned behavior, but only if income is high. Conclusion: Positive and negative attitudes towards buying on instalment and credit card use are not correlated with saving attitudes or behavior. © 2018

AB  - In the aftermath of the financial crisis the European financial system, particularly banks, still struggles to recover the lost public confidence. Ethical financial behavior and customer centricity have gained weight, not only from the viewpoint of banking customers, but also from international organizations’ one. The paper aims at analyzing the strengths and challenges associated with a different banking model, namely the cooperative banks’ one, in terms of its ability to maintain its genuine, cooperative principles. The paper provides a comprehensive insight into the intrinsic financial indicators and their evolution over time. The descriptive statistics analysis comprises the 23 member organizations of European Association of Co-operative Banks, which represent the cooperative banks operating in EU countries, to have a complete picture of their positioning, in terms of market share, liquidity, capitalization and contribution to the domestic financial depth. Secondly, we conducted an exploratory approach named Cluster Analysis, for two years of reference, in order to identify most resembling business models and gather them in the same cluster. The results emphasized which cooperative member organizations still follow the original cooperative business model and mission, and which of them have migrated towards a more commercial banking one. © 2019, Institute of Geography of the Slovak Academy of Science.

AB  - The profits of the Finnish industry of electricity distribution are driven by a rate of return regulation model. Changes in the model caused a remarkable jump in distribution system operator (DSO) profits. The model rewards large costs and gives the DSOs an incentive to build an extremely weatherproof network, to overinvest. Allowed exceptions to lower costs of network construction may not be fully utilized. Risks connected to demographic changes may influence the forecasted network investment profitability. The emergence of energy communities may also affect the DSOs. There may be differences between public and private DSOs' financial behavior. The ability of stakeholders to affect regulatory decisions is asymmetric. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Multiple customer data management has become a focus of attention in big organizations. Although much information is available, it does not translate into significant profitable value-added services. We present a design of a commercial web application based on business intelligence that generates information on social and financial behavior of clients in an organization; with the purpose of obtain additional information that allows to get more profits. This app will provide a broader perspective for making strategic decisions to increase profits and reduce internal investment costs. A case in point is the financial sector, a group of financial entities were used to make measurements and test them. A design to build a web application aimed at achieving a large and ambitious goal by means of defined tools reflecting clients' business needs is proposed. In this research, different techniques and technologies are explored, such as diagrams, frameworks, design, architecture, model entity-relationship, tables, equations, mental maps and development tools. Through the Personal Software Process methodology and with the help of information extraction, consolidation, and visualization, the implementation can be carried out. This article provides the importance of implementing business intelligence in an organization and expands on the steps needed for the implementation of this valuable technology. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

AB  - In a post-Keynesian growth model with two types of workers, an attempt is taken to understand changes in financial behaviour and income distribution and their macroeconomic causes and consequences. For a relatively strong speed of adjustment in the financial market and a relatively weak reserve army effect, a stable steady state is achieved in the wage-led demand regime. An endogenous and perpetual business cycles may emerge in both the regimes. While in some scenario, a contraction in the wage gap between white and blue-collar employments can make the steady state unstable, in a profit-led demand regime, a rise in the wage gap can destabilize the economy. A more regulated financial market is desirable for ensuring the economy's stability in a weak wage-led or a weak profit-led demand regime. A more regulated labour market and a rise in unionization are desirable as these can mitigate income inequality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aims to explore and understand the implementation of Hulontalo ethnic values in SME's financial decision-making. The determination of informants begins with the decision of the key informant; then, the appointment of informants is developed during field searches using the Snowballing Sampling technique. The informants in this study were as many as nine people. An entrepreneur must have skills in managing his business, expertise in making quality products and implementing the values of Adati Hula-hula'a to Sara'a, Sara'a Hulahula'a to Kuran, which support the theory. There are three implementations of Hulontalo ethnic traditional values in financial decision-making: piyohu, Dilapottitilandingo, and payango. This research was hoped to support the pecking order theory and obtained a new indicator that can be considered for an individual in making financial decisions, namely Daadata Tilapulo (productivity). © 2023, Bulgarska Akademiya na Naukite.

AB  - Extensive empirical evidence shows that women perform worse in financial literacy tests, which implies that their financial behaviour may also be worse compared to men. However, the literature on the gender gap in financial behaviour is scanty and highly inconclusive. Using data from a survey of married and cohabiting couples living in Poland (N=1,000) and a multi-dimensional scale validated in terms of its psychometric properties, this article compares the financial behaviour of women and men. The applied tests did not show any significant gender differences in the overall financial behaviour index or in any of the subdomains of the behaviour distinguished in the applied scale. Using the social identity theory as a framework, we discuss possible explanations of these puzzling findings, which may imply that women are unnecessarily considered a disadvantaged group in terms of preparedness to participate in financial life, including the business sphere. Implications for Central European audience: Assuming that the gender differences in financial literacy and behaviour can be explained on the grounds of the social identity theory, Central and Eastern Europe may differ from Western Europe in terms of the gender gap. Socially-imposed gender roles were presumably shaped differently behind the Iron Curtain, which resulted in that the distinction between masculine and feminine roles got blurred under the Soviet regime. As a result, the absence of gender differences in financial behaviour is more likely to occur in Central and Eastern European countries. Financial education initiatives should take this circumstance into account. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Numerous studies have tried to explain the financial behaviour of firms based on different theories. Despite the vast and rich literature, only in the last decade has attention also been focused on emerging economies. In the first place, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of the capital structure in an emerging economy, such as that of the Dominican Republic, testing the sustainability of the trade-off and pecking order theories. Secondly, we also investigated the impact of tax policy on the financial behaviour of businesses. In this perspective, this study overcomes the distorting problems associated with estimating the tax variable, as it uses data from each company’s tax returns. The data were provided by the Ministry of Finance to the World Bank as part of a collaboration on the analysis of fiscal policy. A fixed-effects (FE) estimation technique has been employed to analyse the financial structure of companies. Overall, the results show that the individual determinants have a strong ability to explain the capital structure of companies, also highlighting that, in some cases, the fiscal variable influences the financial behaviour of companies. © 2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

AB  - Entrepreneurship has been viewed as a catalyst for economic growth because it creates jobs and offers solutions to social issues. The government is trying to make entrepreneurship popularized among the public, especially in students in universities. This analysis aims to ascertain how financial behavior and literacy, particularly among accounting students who are the sample of this study at West Java universities, affect entrepreneurial motivation. In addition, this research also examined the level of financial literacy and the level of financial behavior in accounting students in West Java, Indonesia. This research employs a quantitative approach and the data were collected using a survey questionnaire. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) method were used to analyze data of 252 respondents of accounting students from universities in West Java, Indonesia. The study discovered a significant positive association between financial literacy and accounting students’ financial behavior and their willingness to start their own business. The research also assessed the degree of financial literacy and financial behavior among participants who achieved a relatively strong overall outcome, along with the level of drive for entrepreneurship among respondents with a similarly elevated average performance. This research contributes to educators and educational institutions that it is very important to design an integrated educational curriculum to strengthen the entrepreneurial motivation of accounting students who are the sample of this study at West Java universities in Indonesia. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to show the current status of income provision and diffusion on expenditure chapters by young and educated individuals from different cultures. A comprehensive desk research at global level and for Romania and South Africa and a direct research on equal samples of385 young and educated individuals from the two countries have been performed on personal income sources, expenditure chapters and rational and emotional influences in income distribution. The findings display similarities and differences between the pervasive approaches and the reality for young and educated individuals and between Romania and South Africa regarding income sources, expense chapters, perceptions of income sufficiency and saving and attitudes about purchasing on credit and saving. The findings contradict assessments and statements about one or both countries, attributed to the targeted population features and the current economic, social and cultural realities rendering significant insights to businesses, academics and public authorities.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present results of long-term empirical research on the changing behavior of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Poland in the context of spatial exclusion and spatial ‘justice’. Between 2007 and 2015, the authors conducted cyclical research on the financial behavior of SMEs in Poland on large samples. The scope of research on traditional and virtual space covered mainly: the criteria for selecting a bank for current service and the use of various banking services in particular distribution channels. In the researched period, the percentage of indications to convenient location as the most important factor for selecting a bank dropped from 29% to 16%. In the entire period under research, the highest percentage of indications to convenient location as the most important factor for selecting a bank was recorded in the micro enterprises sector. The percentage of entrepreneurs’ indications of fees and commissions as the most important factor in choosing a bank increased from 28% to 36%. Price parameters became the most important factor of bank selection in the SME sector. Virtual space was used primarily to distribute less complex banking services (checking the account balance and viewing the history of operations on the account, as well as to make transfers). In the case of more complex products, such as deposits or loans, traditional banking branches were preferred. In contrast to the results of the American research (Degryse & Ongena, 2002), in Poland there was no impact of the distance between the company and the bank branch on the loan utilization rates and the loan refusal rates. The research has shown that the virtual space equalizes the opportunities, facilitates business operations, contributes to a drop in prices and improvement in quality of the offered products and services, and renders the access to products and services fairer. © 2020, Insitute of Geography and Spatial Organization Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Financial innovation, green investments, or climate change are changing insurers’ business ecosystems, impacting their business behaviour and financial vulnerability. Supervisors and other stakeholders are interested in identifying the path toward deterioration in the insurance company’s financial health as early as possible. Suptech tools enable them to discover more and to intervene in a timely manner. We propose an artificial intelligence approach using Kohonen’s self-organizing maps. The dataset used for development and testing included yearly financial statements with 4058 observations for European composite insurance companies from 2012 to 2021. In a novel manner, the model investigates the behaviour of insurers, looking for similarities. The model forms a map. For the obtained groupings of companies from different geographical origins, a common characteristic was discovered regarding their future financial deterioration. A threshold defined using the solvency capital requirement (SCR) ratio being below 130% for the next year is applied to the map. On the test sample, the model correctly identified on average 86% of problematic companies and 79% of unproblematic companies. Changing the SCR ratio level enables differentiation into multiple map sections. The model does not rely on traditional methods, or the use of the SCR ratio as a dependent variable but looks for similarities in the actual insurer’s financial behaviour. The proposed approach offers grounds for a Suptech tool of predictive generation to support early detection of the possible future financial distress of an insurance company. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the demographic and personality characteristics toward the level of student's financial literacy. We use gender, age, parental income, pocket money, and place of residence as the proxies of demographic characteristics. In addition, financial attitude, and financial behavior are considered as proxies of personality characteristics. The population of this research is the students of business/management department of Universitas Negeri Jakarta. We use 194 students as the sample which represents twenty percent of population. The result of this study shows that the level of financial literacy of the students is in middle category. We use logistic regression as the statistical tool and also found that several proxies like age, pocket money, and financial behavior had positive effects toward the level of student's financial literacy. However, other proxies like residence and financial attitude had a negative sign on financial literacy. While gender and parental income had no significant effect on financial literacy. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

AB  - Corporate debt default risk poses significant challenges in the business world, requiring a multifaceted approach for effective mitigation. This study, grounded in an ethical decision-making framework, investigates the influence of Confucian culture on shaping ethical corporate culture and managers’ moral capacity and its subsequent impact on corporate debt default risk. Our findings indicate that companies deeply influenced by Confucian culture tend to exhibit lower debt default risks. Specifically, companies that embrace Confucian values demonstrate an enhanced ethical corporate culture and heightened individual moral capacity. These factors play crucial roles in the ethical decision-making process, thereby reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky financial behaviors. Further analysis reveals that the inhibitory effect of Confucian culture on debt default risk is particularly pronounced in enterprises operating within regions characterized by poor integrity environments and weak product market competition. This inhibitory effect can lead to a reduction in the cost of corporate debt financing and the risk of stock price crashes. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of the interplay between culture, business ethics, and corporate risk management. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - The present global economy is in a profound adjustment phase, with various risks and an increasingly complex and dynamic international situation. Thus, the government of different countries regulated their economic operating speed by frequently adjusting economic policies, which increased economic policy uncertainty. High economic policy uncertainty can exert adverse effects on the business and information environments of enterprises, which may engage in earnings management and illegal financial behaviours out of their own interest, thereby aggravating market information asymmetry. To explore the influence of economic policy uncertainty on the financial information disclosure of enterprises, data from Chinese A-share listed companies during the period of 2007 and 2018 and multiple linear regression models were utilized to analyse the influence of economic policy uncertainty on corporate financial information disclosure, the path mechanism, and heterogeneity. Results show that economic policy uncertainty lowers the earnings management level of enterprises, especially forward earnings management, and reduces the possibility of violative financial information disclosure. The bank loan level is an intermediary mechanism for economic policy uncertainty to influence enterprise earnings management and violative financial information disclosure, and bank loan cost is merely an intermediary path. The influence of economic policy uncertainty on enterprises’ financial information disclosure varies with their internal governance level, institutional investor shareholding ratio, and profit and loss status. As economic policy uncertainty worsens, the research results can provide an important basis for investors’ investment decision making, facilitate regulatory authorities’ supervision of corporate financial information disclosure quality, and enrich the literature on the microeconomic consequences generated by economic policy uncertainty and microscopic influencing factors of corporate financial information disclosure and decision making. © Vilnius University, 2002–2021.

AB  - Purpose – Model finance-seeking behaviour and outcomes by Australian small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) using firm-level panel data. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach – Using firm-level three-year panel data for more than 2,000 SMEs from the Business Longitudinal Database compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the authors estimate separate models for the seeking of finance (debt and/or equity) and the outcomes of finance seeking (successful or unsuccessful). Key explanatory variables include declared business focus (on financial, cost, operational, quality, innovation, and human resource measures), presence of business plans and other documentation related to successful finance seeking, innovation, indicators for family and foreign-owned businesses, and profitability. Control variables include sales, the number of employees, length of operations, export and import activity, government financial assistance, and industry classification. Findings – Business objectives together with a large number of firm-level characteristics, including firm age, size, industry and sales, profits, growth and exports, significantly affect both finance-seeking behaviour and outcomes. The authors find evidence that the pecking-order and agency cost theories of capital structure at least partly explain the financial behaviour of Australian SMEs. Research limitations/implications – Several of the responses in the underlying survey data are qualitative so the authors are unable to assess how the strength of these relationships varies by the levels of sales and profitability. Practical implications – The findings show that business objectives significantly affect SME finance-seeking decisions and outcomes. SMEs that focus on profitability or growth have a strong willingness to seek additional finance; in comparison, SMEs that focus on the quality of their products or services are less likely to apply for additional finance. As only half of the SMEs in the sample considered profitability or growth to be a major business focus, core business objectives greatly affect SME financing decisions. Further, pecking-order theory not trade-off theory better explains the financial behaviour of SMEs, yielding evidence that SMEs continue to face financial constraints when pursuing growth. Some evidence also of agency cost theory in the positive effects of family ownership on debt seeking. Originality/value – One of very few studies to examine finance seeking by SMEs, especially in Australia. Further, only study known to include declared business strategy, presence of business plans and other finance-related documentation and innovation in addition to the usual focus on growth and profitability to explain financing behaviour. Very large panel of longitudinal data used to explain financial decision making over time. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Substantial research results suggest the global financial crisis has negatively affected consumers' trust in financial service providers. Notably, trust not only relates to consumer trust in individual companies but also relates to the broader business context in which consumers may plan and carry out their financial behavior. This latter form of trust can be referred to as “broad-scope” trust (BST). BST is especially important in a society context because lack of BST may reduce financial market dynamism, competition, and productivity. Consequently, financial service providers assume an important social responsibility in order to develop BST. Unfortunately, not much is known about the interplay between BST and consumer financial behavior. Based on two surveys comprising 1155 bank consumers and 756 mutual fund investors, respectively, this study investigates the moderating influence of BST on relations between knowledge, cognitive effort, and financial healthiness and also examines the direct influence of BST on cognitive effort and financial healthiness. The results indicate that BST negatively moderates relations between knowledge and financial healthiness and between cognitive effort and financial healthiness. In addition, it is demonstrated that BST negatively influences cognitive effort and positively influences financial healthiness. Our results demonstrate the importance of developing BST as it may ease the burdens put on consumers' financial knowledge and processing capabilities, which in turn may facilitate their financial well-being.

AB  - Businesses have been exposed to various challenges during the global pandemic. Unfortunately, the financially vulnerable groups in society are disproportionately affected by such a difficult time. Therefore, it is important for businesses to recognise this when creating new business models for sustainable corporate management. This paper attempts to (1) identify the factors that affect individual financial vulnerability, (2) develop survey items to assess financial vulnerability and its factors and (3) provide the characteristics of financially vulnerable groups by presenting a complete set of descriptive statistics. The results can help to create more inclusive business models that are better equipped to address the challenges ahead. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted with collaboration with an NGO that provides a financial counselling service in Hong Kong. In total, 338 valid responses were collected and the data were used to characterise financially vulnerable groups in terms of (1) change in financial conditions due to COVID-19; (2) exposure to digitised financial services and related push marketing; (3) financial management ability; (4) changes in four financial behaviours and (5) financial vulnerability as measured according to the debt/service ratio. Results show that the respondents have a median debt/service ratio of 0.513, which represents an unsustainable level of debt. Around ¼ of surveyed respondents reported that their debt/service ratio was 1 or even higher, indicating obvious difficulties in meeting financial obligations. A total of 36.7% of the respondents reported worsening financial conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19. The results presented provide a solid empirical set of data that will help future research work to examine and/or develop a heuristic financial vulnerability model that incorporates the key factors leading to it. Businesses can refer to them when creating new business models that are sustainable, able to meet corporate social responsibility goals and can achieve several targets/goals of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - We use unique administrative data and a quasi-field experiment of exogenous allocation in Sweden to estimate medium-and longer-run effects of peoples' exposure to financially literate neighbors on their financial behavior. We contribute evidence of (1) a causal impact of exposure and of a social multiplier of financial knowledge and (2) unfavorable distributional aspects of externalities. Exposure promotes saving in private retirement accounts and stockholding, especially when neighbors have economics or business education, but only for educated households and for substantial interaction possibilities. Findings point to a transfer of knowledge rather than mere imitation or effects through labor, education, or mobility channels.

AB  - The present paper studies the peculiarities of the structure of small and medium-sized high-tech and innovative companies' activities financing. The empirical base of the work was the survey data of small and medium-sized high-tech and innovative companies located in the city of Novosibirsk, the Russian Federation. The results of the survey of high-tech companies have shown that lack of financial resources is the main obstacle for the creation and development of high-tech and innovative small business, for developing business it is one of the main barriers to development. Although the main sources of financing are own funds of companies, it is necessary for the development of the increase in external funding. Attracting external financing, companies adhere to a certain hierarchy of sources of capital, the preferred sequence of which includes bank loans, partners' funds and state budget sources. Venture investment is still available to a small number of companies. Venture investment is still available to a small number of companies. Differences in the financial behaviour of high-tech companies that are associated with the stage of the company's life cycle are revealed. As the company matures, it uses a greater number of financing sources.

AB  - The need for improved institutional interventions aimed at increasing access to financial services by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has been emphasized. Complimenting these efforts, this study proposes that building social networks capable of informing requisite financial behaviors would facilitate the financial inclusion of SMEs co-existing in business clusters. This study aimed to empirically test the moderating influence of collective action, bonding, trust, and bridging on the effect of financial behavior on financial inclusion. Using a sample of 311 owners/managers of small and medium scale businesses in sub-urban clusters in South-Eastern Nigeria, the hierarchical moderated regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses of the study. Results show a positive main effect of financial behavior on financial inclusion (βf = 0.162; t (304) = 1.503; p < 0.05). Also, collective action (βfca = 0.201; t (304) = 6.906; p < 0.05) and bridging (βfbr = 0.201; t (304) = 6.906; p < 0.05) had positive moderating effects, bonding (βfb = 0.032; t (304) = 1.423; p > 0.05) and trust (βft = 0.014; t (304) = 0.9609; p > 0.05) were statistically insignificant. For policy implications, social virtues such as bridging and collective action are more veritable tools for financial inclusion than the personal virtues of trust and bonding and should be factored into economic and social intervention being deployed by institutions interested in meeting the banking/financial needs of businesses. © Chike Onodugo, Ifeoma Onodugo, Anastasia Ogbo, Henry Okwo, Charles Ogbaekirigwe, 2021

AB  - Competitive advantage is the key to a company's success, and the business strategy represents a long-term plan to achieve a competitive advantage by affecting the company's financial behavior. This research studies the interaction of business strategy, competitive advantage, and financial strategy to explore whether companies choose different financial strategies based on their business strategies as well as what role competitive advantage plays in their decision-making. By building a composite index and observing maturity mismatched investment, this research quantifies the risk level of business strategies and financial strategies. Using text analysis of a company's annual report, the research builds a dummy variable to measure the competitive advantage. Based on the samples of A-shares listed on the China Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2007 to 2016, the research shows that the risk level of business strategy and financial strategy tends to move in opposite directions. If a company embraces an aggressive business strategy, it is more likely to choose a conservative financial approach in terms of lower overall risks, but for the company with a competitive advantage, the negative correlation between these two strategies is weakened. Further analysis found that company ownership, free cash flow, and the quality of internal control also play a significant role in the interaction between business strategy and financial strategy. Our findings not only enrich research on business strategy and financial behavior, but also deepen the understanding of competitive advantage and corporate financial strategy theoretically. © 2019 Journal of Competitiveness.

Findings: This research uncovers the strategic use of four key principles: loss aversion, overconfidence, scarcity bias and social proof, within the scam operation. These tendencies are manipulated to induce victims to progressively invest into the fraudulent scheme, even amid growing suspicions. Research limitations/implications: While the research elucidates on the workings of one specific online scam, it is necessary to explore if and how these principles are used in various other online fraudulent schemes, to develop comprehensive countermeasures. Practical implications: The findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced public awareness, stronger corporate responsibility and robust regulatory oversight. There is a call for concerted efforts encompassing public education campaigns, fortified security protocols and strong legal frameworks for preventing such scams. Social implications: The research emphasizes the need for collective action in ensuring a safe online space. This involves the individual user’s prudence, businesses’ proactive education initiatives and stringent legal actions against fraudulent activities. Originality/value: This research offers novel insights into the nuanced manipulation of behavioral finance principles within online scams, based on empirical data from victim testimonials. These findings contribute to the understanding of the psychological mechanisms at play in online scams and are instrumental in formulating effective preventive strategies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Second, we build an agent-based model where artificial agents replicate heterogeneous financial behavior induced from discovery driven economic experiments. The aggregate and disaggregate outcomes of the model are then investigated to identify the role of entrepreneurs' financial decisions in facing aggregate negative events or in generating endogenous business cycles. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Default prediction provides a way to control and direct firms in achieving their goals. The common approach in this regard has been to study the relationship between set of explanatory variables and financial distress. The study served specific objectives by highlighting the sectors impact on financial behavior of Pakistani listed firms across sectors. The study looks into the sector specific attributes that affect the bankruptcy prediction determinants. Since sectors operate in business environments which are subject to different levels of growth, competiveness and market concentration. The study will investigate the relationship of several independent firm-level, sector level variables that have to be examined with dependent variable. Financial variables nature is not normal so logit used for the nature and also financial distress is binomial variable. In addition, the company may provide the possibility of financial distress and indicates an argument that this study used independent variables that are best predictors of financial distress. © 2016, Econjournals.

AB  - Low business outlook due to poor financial decisions among students has continued to attract interest of financial educators and professionals. Previous studies have interrogated financial literacy with sparse attention given to business risk-taking among students' start-ups in Nigeria. This research gap forms the basis of this study. The aim of this paper is the interrogation of financial knowledge and financial behavior as a lever for business risk-taking among start-up students of the University of Lagos, Nigeria. The philosophical perspective drew insight from the positivist approach with a random sampling of 145 final-year students selected from the departments of Business Administration, Accounting and Employment, and Labour Relations of the Faculty of Management Sciences. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and Bartlett's test were conducted to determine sample adequacy. Regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. The results show that financial knowledge and behavior of start-ups revealed a high propensity to be engaged in business risk-taking (β = .407, t (511) = 7.556, p < 0.05; β = .412, t (1.511) = 7.525, p < 0.05) with males showing more financial literacy understanding for business risk than females (β = .591, t (2;510) = 4.381, p < 0.05; β = .280, t (2;510) = 2.217, p = 0.262) respectively. The findings show the need for the continuous development of students' start-up behavioral and attitudinal disposition, especially females in becoming more financial literate for appropriate financial decision-making in business risk-taking and venture creation. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has created an environment of uncertainty, stress and financial vulnerability. As countries all over the world adopted preventive strategies ranging from voluntary isolations to stringent lockdowns, people and businesses were required to adjust their dispositions to the new normal resulting in new behaviors. The customer behaviour in financial services was also impacted and especially in developing economies as people were required to move to digital financial platforms at haste. In recent times, Fintech services are on a steady rise globally but their presence in the emerging markets is in a nascent stage and adoption by the low-income segment customers has largely been elusive. Much work is required to understand the needs of this customer cohort to identify factors for product adoption. This study investigates the impact on financial behavior among low-income segment customers for Fintech services due to the pandemic. By testing a set of hypotheses regarding inclination to adopt Fintech the study presents prominent antecedents such as fear, social influence, awareness and trust that led to positive product adoption. The study discusses the theoretical and managerial implications of the study and presents direction for future research. © 2020 TRANSNATIONAL MARKETING JOURNAL. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Young investors in Indonesia face an uptrend of awareness toward sustainable investment (SI) especially in this era where critical issues such as climate change is major. It is crucial to understand their motivations and interest during their complex decision-making process regarding the company’s ESG’s issues in their investment activities. Hence why, the question arises “Why do some young investors in Indonesia integrate sustainable investment in their portfolio?” remains largely unresolved. Previous research is still limited when it comes to non-professional individual investor’s financial behaviour. Therefore, this study builds hypotheses that are tested through online surveys conducted in Indonesia and analysed using statistical software SPSS to gain insights on the correlation of the investor’s decision-making process in SI. The results show a strong positive influence on investor’s financial literacy with their sustainability information and the usage of negative screening strategy towards their SI decision. Whilst a strong negative towards herding behaviour, which implies young investors have significant personal attitudes toward environmental, social and governance concerns in the company that they invest in. The research contributes to studies on young individual investors' decision-making, especially their way of diversifying their portfolio. It examines the factors that influence the usage of sustainability data and the choice to invest in sustainable businesses. Copyright 2023 GMP Press and Printing.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to extend the extant literature on the relationship between financial risk tolerance (FRT), awareness of Islamic financial principles (AWIF) and positive financial behaviour (FB) on financial satisfaction (FS) of micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) owners by principally investigating the mediating effect of access to Islamic financing (AIF) on these relationships. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative survey method of data collection through a self-administered questionnaire. The sample of 384 MSME owners was selected in which 208 questionnaires were retrieved and analysed using the partial least square structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: The result shows that the relationships between FRT and AIF as well as FB and AIF are not significant. However, the AWIF–AIF relationship was found to be positively significant. Moreover, only the mediating effect of AIF on the AWIF–FS relationship was established. Practical implications: The result implies that AIF could strongly influence the FS of MSME owners, and the AWIF–FS relationship is better explained with sufficient AIF. However, AIF could not mediate the relationships between FRT–FS and FB–FS. Therefore, policymakers and MSME owners should emphasize on AWIF and AIF to enhance FS. Originality/value: This study pioneers the examination of the mediating influence of AIF on FRT, AWIF, FB and FS of MSME owners in a single framework. Despite the importance of MSME owners on economic sustainability, literature on MSME owners' FS is lacking expressly among developing countries, particularly in Nigeria. This study also revealed new theoretical and practical knowledge by illuminating the mediating effect of AIF on AWIF–FS relationship. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study intends to examine and analyze the influence of financial literacy on people's behavior and the difference in financial literacy and behavior based on gender. The population of this research comprises students in higher education institutions in Jakarta and were selected using the snowball sampling technique. This study utilizes the survey technique by distributing questionnaires to the sample population, and the variance-based structural equation model (SEM) was used to statistically analyze the responses. After deliberating the results, this study concludes that males have better financial literacy and behavior than females; financial literacy can intervene in the association between gender and money-related behavior. This means males tend to manage their money when they are financially knowledgeable. Based on this evidence, higher education institutions must set personal financial management as mandatory and elective subjects for business and non-business departments in their curriculum, respectively.  © 2023 Conscientia Beam.

AB  - The debate on the funding of business creation focuses on the provision of funds by banks. Our study examines the financial behavior of eighteen women who set up small craft and commercial activities. It is based on a theoretical approach and on a qualitative methodology, which give a central place to the temporal and exploratory dimension in the understanding of the various interactions between the creators of the companies and their closer financial environment. The results of the study show a case of DIY. The latter is revealed in the ability of women to assign new objectives to financial resources, which they have mobilized from the banks of the financial system, mutual tontines, relatives and friends. This tinkering is a source of understanding for the State, the actors of the financial system and civil society, who participate in the renewal of the business park, in Thiès, in the Escale-Nord district, in Senegal. © 2021 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil Canadien de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the role of mental accounting, financial attitude, and financial self-efficacy on financial behavior. Furthermore, this study examines the effect of financial knowledge on mental accounting, financial attitude, and financial self-efficacy. This study uses 400 student respondents who have businesses. Data analysis using PLS. The results show that financial behavior is influenced by mental accounting, financial attitude, and financial self-efficacy. However, financial knowledge did not increase mental accounting and financial self-efficacy. This study proves that mental accounting is very important for student success in business. Mental accounting controls the mindset of young entrepreneurs in managing finances so that they have a positive financial attitude, good financial self-efficacy, and effective financial behavior. From this study, we believe that mental accounting plays an important role for young entrepreneurs in financial decision-making. However, financial knowledge does not necessarily influence the mental accounting mindset. © 2022 Radianto et al.

AB  - There are widespread claims that a productivity crisis afflicts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry despite the fact that the U.S. institutional environment provides unique advantages for drug R&D. We argue that the explanation for this productivity paradox is the “financialization” of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Driven by shareholder-value ideology, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry has adopted a highly financialized business model. Its key performance metrics are stock-price yield and dividend yield, supported by distributions to shareholders through large-scale stock buybacks and cash dividends. With this financial behavior incentivized by stock-based executive pay, value extraction from corporations for the sake of distributions to shareholders comes at the expense of drug innovation. Simultaneously, however, a number of less-financialized European companies are making use of the U.S. innovation system to outcompete the U.S. companies at home. Arguing that all business enterprises face a tension between innovation and financialization, this article employs the theory of innovative enterprise as a framework for analyzing the evolution of this tension for pharmaceutical companies operating in the United States. We provide evidence of the highly financialized character of the major U.S. pharmaceutical companies in the S&P 500 Index, focusing on distributions to shareholders and the stock-based pay of pharmaceutical executives. After documenting the evolution of the U.S. innovation system for drug R&D since the 1980s and summarizing the U.S. product strategies of seven major European pharmaceutical companies, we pose the hypothesis that under a system of corporate governance supporting innovation, the U.S. innovation system could result in a more innovative pharmaceutical industry. © 2019, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: Debt is at a peak and consumers purport needing help with financial planning. To better understand the antecedents of financial planning behavior, the purpose of this paper is to examine the importance of cultural values in financial decision making within the context of Hispanic American consumers. A new conceptual model is proposed to integrate affect (cultural value) and cognition (financial knowledge) in financial planning. Design/methodology/approach: To uncover respondents’ views on cultural values, financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial planning behavior, an online survey hosted on a business school’s website was distributed to members of two Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. The survey consisted of five parts, and took each respondent an average of 15 minutes to complete. The final data set has 158 observations. Findings: Results analyzed using structural equation modeling confirmed the hypotheses that financial knowledge, attitude, and perceived control simultaneously influence Hispanic consumers’ intentions to purchase financial planning products or services. More interestingly, these results confirm that multiple different routes coexist in the decision-making process, especially within the Hispanic financial planning context. Originality/value: Key contributions of this paper include the conceptualization of cultural value as an antecedent to Hispanic financial behavior; detailing the different routes to financial decision making for US Hispanic consumers; and informing financial service managers on marketing strategies toward Hispanic consumers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Lodging stocks have been gaining more attention from investors, likely due to the growth of the tourism sector (WTTC, 2017). However, limited research focuses on the financial behaviors of this market and prolific trends. The recent spin-offs of the timeshare business in major hotel chains, such as Marriott, Hilton, Starwood, and Wyndham have exposed an important research gap. Investors may know the reasons behind spin-offs, but they may also be able to predict them if they recognize certain conditions, namely, a firm will spin-off if a combination of conditions is met. Thus, this research provides six configurations of accounting and financial variables that lead to a spin-off in the lodging industry. Findings indicate that depending on the motivation behind a spin-off, certain combinations of variables can be recognized, and a spin-off could be predicted. Practical implications are then clear, as stock investment decisions may be influenced by this prediction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using social construction theory, associations between student and classroom characteristics and high school students' financial knowledge and behavior acquisition after studying a financial planning curriculum were examined. Prior to curriculum study, Whites, those growing up in a farm family business, and those who were working had higher financial knowledge; male and female knowledge differed by content. After curriculum study, females, those not growing up in a farm family business, and those who were not working gained most from curriculum study. While Whites, those who were working, and males exhibited more positive behaviors prior to curriculum study, after curriculum study, students living in states having financial mandates and those who did not grow up in a farm family business increased their positive behaviors most. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Purpose: Despite the inescapable picture of hardships and circumstances in Zimbabwe, there has not been dedicated research focused on understanding the management of household finances, particularly to assess financial distress and how it varies among Zimbabweans. This study aims to use survey data to measure financial distress and ascertain the socioeconomic, demographic and behavioural factors associated with it among Zimbabweans. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 1,006 survey respondents from five provinces of Zimbabwe was used. The principal component analysis approach was used to create a composite financial distress score. The t-test for the equality of means and analysis of variance were used to test for the difference in financial distress between groups, whilst the ordinary least squares regression was used to determine the factors associated with financial distress after controlling for other factors. Findings: The study found that consumer financial distress was mainly explained by locality (urban/rural and province), frequency and level of income (informality) and age. Having saved in the past 12 months did not significantly differentiate savers from non-savers on financial distress. The study also found that gender, level of education, marital status, role in household financial decision-making and role in household provisioning were not significant predictors of financial distress. Research limitations/implications: The findings have policy implications, especially for the government of Zimbabwe, its agencies and local authorities. Enacting policies that create opportunities for inclusive and sustainable livelihoods and economic growth should be the priority. In addition, instituting favourable policies that allow informal business to grow, formalise and integrate with the formal economy may help to sustainably grow the economy and alleviate the financial hardships among consumers. For consumers, adopting financial behaviours that ensure that they live within their means cannot be over emphasised. Originality/value: This is the first paper to profile the socioeconomic, demographic and behavioural factors associated with financial distress during the economic downturn among the impoverished Zimbabweans.

AB  - Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are among the cornerstones of the Indonesian economy that managed to survive the world crisis. The development of MSMEs also demands that owners be ready to compete with other MSMEs. This study aims to analyze whether business sustainability is influenced by financial literacy with financial behavior and financial technology as mediators. The research sample includes owners and managers of MSMEs in Indonesia, totaling 342 respondents. Data collection methods used are non-probability sampling techniques by distributing questionnaires. This study uses SEM analysis with PLS analysis tools. It was found that financial literacy does not directly affect business sustainability but affects financial behavior and financial technology. Financial behavior and financial technology are proven to influence business sustainability. Furthermore, financial behavior and financial technology mediate the effect of financial literacy on business sustainability. The results of this study show that financial behavior and financial technology can fully mediate the relationship between financial literacy and business sustainability. Moreover, financial literacy cannot directly affect business sustainability, which must be fully mediated by financial behavior and financial technology. This study also provides practical value regarding the sustainability of MSMEs. Thus, companies can survive in the long term not only with a robust financial literacy foundation but they must be supported by good financial behavior and also be able to choose the right financial technology in their business activities. © Bambang Widagdo, Chalimatuz Sa’diyah, 2023.

AB  - Mobile money, a service that allows monetary value to be stored on a mobile phone and sent to other users via text messages, has been adopted by the vast majority of Kenyan households. We estimate that access to the Kenyan mobile money system M-PESA increased per capita consumption levels and lifted 194,000 households, or 2% of Kenyan households, out of poverty. The impacts, which are more pronounced for female-headed households, appear to be driven by changes in financial behavior - in particular, increased financial resilience and saving - and labor market outcomes, such as occupational choice, especially for women, who moved out of agriculture and into business. Mobile money has therefore increased the efficiency of the allocation of consumption over time while allowing a more efficient allocation of labor, resulting in a meaningful reduction of poverty in Kenya. © 2016, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AB  - This study investigated factors that influence the spending habits of university students. The study utilised primary data collected through structured questionnaires from a sample of 479 students from the College of Humanities and College of Law and Management Studies at the University of KwaZulu- Natal. Nine independent variables, namely, financial knowledge, financial attitude, gender, age, financial aid, years at university, racial groups, family background and course of study, were regressed against spending habits; the dependent variable. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, Chi-square tests, and binary logistic regression.. The study found that financial attitude has a significant influence on students' spending habits. The study found no statistically significant difference in the spending habits of male and female students; students majoring in business and nonbusiness- majors and among different racial groups. © 2020 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Supply chain management (SCM) in small and medium-sized enterprises is aimed at ensuring both short-and long-term effectiveness and efficiency of these enterprises. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) potentially make irrational decisions because of their individual limitations. Specifically, they are subject to biases, including SCM and escalation of commitment. This study investigates the causality of the interaction between SCM and experience and escalation of commitment in SMEs. This paper used a 1x2 laboratory experimental design with 69 subjects of SME owners who produced pressure-cooked milkfish in Semarang City, Central Java, Indonesia. The independent variable was SCM that consisted of two levels (high vs. low self-attribution). Business age was the proxy of experience as the mediating variable. Meanwhile, the dependent variable was escalation of commitment that was measured with investment decisions. The information on SCM was the new product development opportunity of milkfish meatball. Subjects with high SCM were informed that they had a good ability to coordinate with suppliers to develop the new products while those with low SCM were informed on the presence of the uncertain economic condition and bad luck. One-way ANOVA tested the effectiveness of randomization while independent sample test and univariate analysis of variance tested the hypotheses. The study shows that SME owners with a high self-attribution exhibit greater escalation of commitment than those with a low self-attribution. This paper also empirically finds that the interaction between SCM and experience increases escalation of commitment. By demonstrating that SCM likely affects SMEs' investment decisions, this study advises governments to take entrepreneurs' behavioral aspects into account when advocating SMEs. The financial behavior literature on escalation of commitment largely focuses on large firms in their analysis. Meanwhile, the existing phenomena show that decision-making processes in SMEs also exhibit escalation of commitment. This study investigates escalation of commitment in SMEs' investment decision making regarding SCM and experience in running businesses. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to critically evaluate and reflect on the current state of service research in Africa. The purpose is to develop a roadmap to guide future service research in and out of Africa. Design/methodology/approach: This study is a conceptual reflection and in situ observation of service research and practice in Africa. Findings: This study delineates scholarly, policy and managerial pathways for further service research in the African context. Service research in Africa is often experience-based rather than concept-based, and such research is often conducted in close collaboration with the local business community. Theoretical development and empirical exploration through collaboration initiatives among institutions with mutual research interests are encouraged. Research limitations/implications: This study is a theoretical analysis of service research in Africa. Further empirical exploration is needed to delineate service research priorities and methodological directions so as to balance local needs and global relevance. Practical implications: Africa represents fertile terrain for experience-based insights regarding financial behavior, ecosystem services and nation branding. Grassroots-level involvement in research represents a key component of managerial relevance. Social implications: This study highlights the role of service research in and about Africa. The discussion demonstrates that the African Ubuntu values of community involvement and a collectivist orientation can expand the relevance of research from the academic business field to broader society. Originality/value: This study represents a unique perspective on service research in the African context. In doing so, this paper lays the groundwork for more meaningful participation on the part of African-based researchers in the global service research domain. Experience-based research projects focusing on the empirical starting point complement theory development and serve as useful anchors for theory implementation in practice. © 2022, Christo Boshoff, Ogechi Adeola, Robert E.

AB  - This article describes the financial inclusion of fishermen who live in urban areas, as representatives of the bottom of the pyramid. Financial inclusion is measured based on accessibility, usage and barriers. This article fills a gap in the research discussing financial inclusion from the perspective of fishermen who live in urban areas. A descriptive approach is used to convey financial inclusion based on primary data, which are measured by a nominal scale. The data were collected conveniently by involving 51 fishermen's families. The results show that some of the fishermen's families are still categorised as 'unbanked'. Bank accessibility is relatively good in this area, but the usage of bank accounts is still intended mostly for personal transactions rather than for business purposes. The results indicate that saving behaviour needs to be improved, while the loans taken out are aimed at consumption activities, and are accessed through informal institutions. The results tell us that fishermen's communities still have little awareness of the need to protect themselves with insurance against the risks they face. We find the main obstacles to financial inclusion are a low income and a lack of sufficient legal documentation. This article describes financial inclusion from the dimensions of accessibility, usage and barriers. However, it has not been related to other variables that may influence financial behaviour. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - In order to survive in this complex economic business environment with fierce competition among various players of the finance sector, the need is to understand the even more complex financial behaviour of the customers. We apply the support vector machine classifier, a machine learning algorithm to construct a nonlinear model which classifies the customers into good and bad class based on their respective positive and negative saving behaviour. With the help of web-based survey, a sample of urban banking millennial was collected and preprocessed to apply the support vector machine classifier technique. Pattern recognition from data and its prediction for the financial behaviour are based on the machine learning forecasts. Moreover, the comparative analysis of the weightage of the three attributes, namely income level, financial literacy and behavioural characteristic, is carried out and it is analysed for the savings/wealth accumulation of the millennial generation to understand the financial distress among the said generation in context. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Do female entrepreneurs in MENA countries face obstacles in funding their business, either endogenous (self-selection) or exogenous (discrimination)? Literature review provides controversial evidence thereof and, so far, very few papers tackled this funding issue for female entrepreneurs in MENA countries. A pooled sample of 6,253 Micro, Small and Medium sized Enterprises from the 2019 World Bank Enterprise Survey (WBES) including three North African countries (Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia) and three Middle East countries (Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine) documents the financial behaviour of both owners and managers according to gender. Two logistic regression models (marginal effects) address loan demand and loan supply with respect to self-selection vs. discrimination. No self-selection occurs for female owners and managers but there is discrimination for female owners. An estimation of these models on a subsample of Micro, Small and Medium enterprises (MSMEs) provide a robustness test. Sampling biases in the WBES together with the characteristics of female clients of microfinance institutions suggest that micro-entrepreneurs would have faced bank discrimination and self-selection. Hence, public authorities should support pooling loan guarantees in favour of female entrepreneurs, i.e. a positive discrimination. © 2022, Faculty of Social Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study focuses on determining the level of financial organization of Barranquilla entrepreneurs through a multiple regression model. To develop this study, a field collection process based on the quantitative approach is used, applying a survey of 35 Likert scale items to a total of 305 entrepreneurs from the city of Barranquilla-Colombia. The results of the multiple linear regression model are suitable for predicting the behavior of finances based on independent factors: Recognize your balance point, design a budget that supports decision making in the business, maintain an organized record of your sales, the sales price of its products is found from validated profit calculations, operational expenses are directly related to the main purpose of the business, the level of debt does not put the operation of the business at risk, it complies with all tax obligations, and for the organization of its accounting operations it has software. It is concluded that these independent factors are predictive of financial behavior, highlighting the importance of improving the financial organization of local entrepreneurs to boost economic growth in the region. © Licencia de Creative Commons Atribución 4.0 Internacional (CC BY 4.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.es

AB  - This paper adds new insights on the specificities of entrepreneurs, by focusing on the specificity of entrepreneurs' financial behaviour. First, we provide a detailed review of the literature on the private equity premium puzzle. This review underlines that, from a financial perspective, entrepreneurs differ from non-entrepreneurs because of the low, according to financial theory, risk-return trade-off of their asset portfolio. Our analysis of the literature shows that the higher risk tolerance of entrepreneurs is not sufficient to explain the private equity premium puzzle. Therefore, we apply behavioural finance in order to explain why entrepreneurs, who are aware of their high risk exposure,do still accept low returns. We show how cognitive biases can explain the private equity puzzle. Moreover, we highlight that this puzzle can be understood in light of cumulative prospect theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992) and behavioural portfolio theory (Shefrin and Statman, 2000) findings. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This study explores the nexus between digital financial inclusion and household participation in commercial insurance, utilizing data from the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index and the 2018 CFPS database. Using Probit and Logit models, our research uncovers significant regional and risk -preference variations, emphasizing the influence of governance mechanisms. The study underscores the pivotal role of digital participation in a sustainable governance mechanism in shaping financial behavior, as well as the importance of advocating for regulatory interventions, enhanced financial literacy, and infrastructure development to foster equitable insurance access. Moreover, positive determinants, such as education level and social insurance participation, are identified, while discretionary spending emerges as a barrier. This study advocates for expedited digital financial inclusion initiatives to increase financial literacy with strengthened regulatory oversight and governance mechanisms which would ensure sustainable regional development and insurance market resilience. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Conventional approaches to the study of SME finance tend to focus on the changing financing options and preferences as small businesses move through different stages. However, one of the limitations of such approaches is that they do not explain how small businesses make decisions that lead to their financial structures. This paper suggests that small business owners deliberately choose how they manage their firms’ finance as a direct consequence of their personal objectives for owning a business. This paper summarizes the findings of a qualitative study with 11 small business owners using a novel qualitative model developed by Holmes and Gupta [2015, Opening Aladdin’s cave: Unpacking the factors impacting on small businesses. In A. Moore & J. Simon (Eds.), Small business conditions and finance (pp. 37–56). Sydney: Reserve Bank of Australia.]. The results uncover a series of underlying factors (such as personal perspectives, life events and future outlook) which shape the goals and perceptions of small business owners, and influence their financial decision, actions and future funding options, thereby reinforcing the view that small firms are an extension of their personal objectives. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Big data; how big, is bigger than what the traditional application can handle and this gives a feel about the quantum of data which is being talked in the big data. Each day the technology is changing and everybody else is trying to cope up with the changes in the macro technological environment. Banks do generate a huge amount of data in their ordinary course of business which was being dumped in the books almost a decade back. Today the same data is being processed, analyzed and used for the benefits of the banks and customer. The data so generated can be used to customize services to the customer, to understand his needs, to design the most appealing marketing strategy to name a few. The big data, Peta-byte, can be efficiently used to analyze the financial behavior of a customer. A customer, who would have defaulted on a loan, may relocate making it difficult for the banks to trace but he still might be active on the social media, which can be used to trace the customer. This is one odd benefit which big data has to offer. All said and done, there are challenges to implement the big data technology for any bank. The biggest constraint comes from the finance front where any new technology requires a huge outlay of cash in the form of infrastructure, training and development cost and data warehouse and storage cost. The researchers have taken a hypothetical, yet practical, example to demonstrate the possible benefits of the adoption of the big data into a bank by calculating the net present value of the project. The researchers have used multiple rates instead of a single rate to help the users to take the net present value according to the rate applicable to them. The internal rate of return has also been calculated to understand the return which the project is generated itself and the same can be used by the users to compare with their internal rate of return to judge the viability of the project. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

AB  - The development of information technology encourages the growth of technology in the financial sector (financial technology). Financial technology is an innovative business model and new technology that has the potential to transform the financial services industry. In this study, the author will discuss cryptocurrency which is the result of the development of financial technology. Although cryptocurrency technology is considered as one of the secure online integrated payment systems in financial transactions, cryptocurrencies are considered to be still not ready to face uncertain economic movements and do not yet have an adequate legal basis. Therefore, this study aims to find out what factors influence the young generation in making decisions to invest in cryptocurrencies and how prepared Indonesia's young generation is to face the advancement of financial technology (cryptocurrency). In this study, financial knowledge and locus of control will be used as independent variables, financial behavior as a moderating variable and financial decision as a dependent variable in examining factors that influence the young generation in making decisions. We use a questionnaire survey that provides input on the response of the young generation on this matter. We took a sample of the young generation with an age range of 18-20 years as many as 75 respondents who were chosen randomly. The results of this study indicate that the factors that influence the young generation in making decisions to invest in cryptocurrencies are locus of control which has been moderated by financial behavior and the majority of respondents invest in cryptocurrencies because they follow trends or just for Fomo, more mature preparation is needed in the face of advances in financial technology. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.

AB  - The marketing performance models, regardless of their nature and applications, should ultimately lead to creation of cash flows efficiently. This common objective emphasizes on a basic proposition: the output (dependent) variable must be intrinsically correlated to the financial behavior of the firm at the micro level. The four criteria for marketing performance and evaluation are Financial relevance, Actionable, Stable behavior, and Reliable long-term guidance respectively. By using those four criteria as the cornerstone, the Core Sales - Response Model was formulated under the Process perspective (the marketing procedure which helps to generate cash flows along with other antecedents of financial performance). This research paper is aimed at restructuring the fundamental Sales - Response model with the dependent variable Sales and three independent variables, namely, Marketing Support, Firm - controlled factors, and Uncontrolled factors in view of uncertainties related to global turmoil and widespread economic recession into a three - dimensional model by dropping 'Marketing Support' to fit the foundation of mathematical chaos theory and try to test its impact in the real world scenario by two ways: first, whether it can accurately define the current nature of functioning of a business firm under chaotic business environment, and second, given the condition of chaos; if the firm fails to prove its stability, what actions should be taken to stabilize its position in the feasible space. In order to serve the purposes, the manufacturing giant Apple, Inc. ® has been considered as the sample firm for the time - series study of 10 years (2009-2018). © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Empirical research on the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has focused mainly on theoretical approaches related to hierarchical order and, to a lesser extent, on trade-off theory. However, the financial literature has recently revealed that the life-cycle stages of SMEs influence their financial choices, which may explain why business financing evolves over time. Thus, this paper used a panel data approach to study the impact of life cycle phases on the capital structure of 70 Tunisian industrial SMEs during the period from 2013 to 2016. We found that Tunisian SMEs tended to use debt more intensively in the short term, while long-term debt was rarely used. We also found that the life cycle theory is perfectly adapted to describe the financial behavior adopted by Tunisian SMEs, which tend to use debt (regardless of maturity) during the early life cycle phases. Once SMEs age and mature, other sources of funding take over (mainly self-financing and even an IPO). © 2019 AESS Publications. All Rights Reserved.
