TI  - Financial Literacy, Financial Education, and Downstream Financial Behaviors
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - Policy makers have embraced financial education as a necessary antidote to the increasing complexity of consumers' financial decisions over the last generation. We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of financial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201 prior studies. We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples. Like other education, financial education decays over time; even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational studies that measure financial literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies, and we find that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial literacy to control for omitted variables. Financial education as studied to date has serious limitations that have been masked by the apparently larger effects in correlational studies. We envisage a reduced role for financial education that is not elaborated or acted upon soon afterward. We suggest a real but narrower role for "just-in-time" financial education tied to specific behaviors it intends to help. We conclude with a discussion of the characteristics of behaviors that might affect the policy maker's mix of financial education, choice architecture, and regulation as tools to help consumer financial behavior.

TI  - The Impact of Financial Education for Youth in Ghana
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Governments and non-governmental organizations promote school-based financial literacy programs as means to instill financial behaviors that can persist through adulthood. We conduct a randomized trial of two financial literacy education programs in government-run Ghanaian primary and junior high schools. The first integrated both financial and social education, while the second included only financial education. Our study finds that after nine months, both programs had positive impacts on self-reported savings at school relative to the control group, but there were no statistically significant increases in aggregate savings nor in hypothesized mechanisms such as attitudes, preferences, or knowledge. The financial education-only treatment led to a weakly statistically significant increase in child labor relative to the control group, although the difference in impact between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant. The lack of short-term effects of these programs on financial behaviors and attitudes indicate that alternative program designs should be evaluated to understand whether and how these outcomes can be influenced among students in this age group.

TI  - Financial Education, and Gender Equity
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - This study investigates how to promote gender equity in finance through early financial education using the survey responses gathered in Singapore. The empirical tests for the effect of financial education on financial literacy suggest that women who receive early financial education better understand the compounding effect of interest rates on loans, portfolio diversification, and mortgage payments. The impact of early financial education on financial behavior is also evident in women's increased participation in the stock market, insurance activities, and savings habits. The implications can be used to guide policymakers charged with promoting gender equity through early financial education.

TI  - Sustainable Financial Education and Consumer Life Satisfaction
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Sustainable financial education is defined as the continuous input of money and time on financial knowledge education after formal schooling. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of sustainable financial education on consumer life satisfaction. Utilizing the dataset of Household Consumer Finance of Chinese Urban Residents in 2012 by the China Financial Research Center of Tsinghua University, the variable of sustainable financial education is constructed through the variables of the necessity of financial education, the money spent on financial education, and the time spent on financial education. To improve the estimation results, order probit regression is utilized. The results indicate that financial education is significantly positive to consumer life satisfaction only for a consumer with higher education. Consumers who regard financial education to be of high necessity will feel more satisfied. The results also show that consumers who spend more money and time on financial education after formal schooling will be more satisfied. Moreover, the sustainable impacts of financial education on consumer life satisfaction are verified. In addition, this study provides empirical evidence that suggests that sustainable financial education positively contributes to consumer life satisfaction. The results have implications for policymakers to take measures in enhancing sustainable financial education to improve consumer life satisfaction.

TI  - Perspectives on evaluation in financial education: Landscape, issues, and studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC EDUCATION
AB  - This review discusses the heterogeneity in the effectiveness of financial education programs that occurs because of the unique conditions for programs and methods to evaluate them. The authors define six groups served by financial education: children, youth, college students and young adults, working adults, military personnel, and low-incomeconsumers. They then discuss research and evaluation literature for each group with a critical eye on program purpose, content, and evaluation. They also present findings affecting multiple groups on four issues: student loans, homeownership, retirement planning, and financial advising. The accumulated evidence on the effectiveness of financial education is positive, although the results are nuanced and sometimes limited. The authors argue that understanding this broad landscape in studying financial education is critical for future research and evaluation.

TI  - The Value of Financial Education During Multiple Life Stages
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This study examines the timing of financial education and its impact on short-term and long-term financial behavior. We also explore the power of financial education on financial knowledge and examine the link between financial knowledge and positive financial behavior. Exposure to financial education during multiple life stages leads to a better financial outcome. Financial education taught via multiple channels, including high school, college, the workplace, and at home, is the most optimal in the long run. For those who did not attend college, being exposed to financial education in high school is significantly associated with positive financial behavior. We cite implications for all financial education advocates. Policymakers in the financial capability arena can stay abreast of the channels of financial education that produce the most fruitful economic and societal gains.

TI  - Does formal and business education expand the levels of financial education?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose Financial education has become an essential component of the economic balance for families, and much is being discussed about the methods, which raise the levels of financial education of the population. Thus, the overall objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of formal and business education on the level of financial education. Design/methodology/approach This research is characterized as a quasi-experimental study, with undergraduate students. As a data collection technique, a structured questionnaire was used. Findings The results confirm the importance of formal and business education, as well as gender, for the financial education of individuals. More specifically, being male and having contact with a greater number of financial disciplines increase the level of financial education of the individual. Originality/value This article demonstrated that the trajectory of the knowledge traversed by individuals within the same level of schooling is of paramount importance. The results show that formal and business education can improve the levels of financial education and reinforce the relevance of strategic actions in this area.

TI  - IMPROVING FINANCIAL INCLUSION: TOWARDS A CRITICAL FINANCIAL EDUCATION FRAMEWORK
T2  - RAE-REVISTA DE ADMINISTRACAO DE EMPRESAS
AB  - Empirical research suggests that financial inclusion initiatives such as facilitating access to financial resources or providing microcredit are alone not enough to lower socioeconomic disparities. In this article, we adopt a critical stance as a guide for our empirical investigation. Our aim is to propose a financial education framework, tailored to low-income micro-entrepreneurs, that embraces new information and communication technologies (ICTs) and seeks to improve financial inclusion and social emancipation. This empirical study was conducted in an Amazonian municipality in Brazil where recent access to ICTs has brought about important and varied socioeconomic changes. Results show that ICT-supported and tailored critical financial education can play a dual role: on the one hand, access to financial education might decrease the effects of generative mechanisms on global/local tensions, triggered by standardized ICT applications; on the other hand, such access might increase financial inclusion and social transformation through the integration of guiding principles into financial education programs.

TI  - The effect of financial education on students' consumer choices: Evidence from a randomized experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Financial education is often considered to be a necessary condition in order to stimulate better consumer choices. We investigate this claim by analyzing the impact of a financial education course on consumer choices made by 688 students of the 8th and 9th grade. We combine a randomized controlled trial with a discrete choice experiment to analyze how financial education and other critical factors of a purchase decision like price, credit availability, information on product quality, and promotion affect consumer decisions at a young age. We find that students favor purchase options with free gifts and positive consumer reviews. They also prefer cash payments over credit. However, we do not find evidence that this behavior is triggered by financial education. Financial education does not automatically result in better consumer choices, even if the financial education course increased students' financial literacy. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Financial education of founders, is it important? A case study of Jacobs Startup Competition
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING
AB  - This paper examines the effect of founders' financial education on the quality of financial information provided to investors as well as on the perceived capabilities of the founding team. The examinations are based on a unique sample of 130 international student-run start-ups. This paper finds that founding teams with at least one member having a financial education background provide more useful and specific, however less readable financial information in their business plans. The results suggest that investors regard founding teams comprised of at least one team member with financial education as more capable and competent. This effect stems from investors' screening of team members' biographic information rather than from indirect effects resulting from higher quality financial reporting in business plans. The findings contribute to the existing entrepreneurship education literature by providing empirical evidence that accounting and finance courses should be core elements of entrepreneurship curricula.

TI  - Teaching financial education in schools and students' financial literacy: A cross-country analysis withPISAdata
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS
AB  - In the last decade, developed and emerging economies have become increasingly aware of the importance of ensuring that their citizens are financially literate. Eighteen countries and economies, including 13 OECD countries, participated for the first time in 2012 on the financial literacy assessment of 15-year-old students. Financial literacy scores varied according to the participating countries, and they were determined by factors related to the teaching-learning process, especially those related to the delivery of financial education in schools. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the provision of financial education in the school curriculum across all the countries that participated in PISA 2012-data from 2015 did not allow such analysis. We measured the direct effect of different ways of financial education delivery on students' financial literacy scores, after controlling for math and reading performance, and individual characteristics of students and their schools. The majority of the countries have introduced financial education topics in the curriculum somehow. But only in the Flemish Community of Belgium, the United States, and Latvia-and to a lesser extent in Australia, Estonia, France, Israel, Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, and the Slovak Republic-the way how financial education (FE) is delivered is positively correlated with students' financial literacy scores: FE taught as part of business or economics courses in Belgium, FE taught as part of a cross-curricular subject in the U.S., and FE taught as part of mathematics in Latvia. Our main findings pose fundamental challenges for educational policy regarding school-based FE. The first is to decide at what age (grade) interventions should be introduced into the education system so that students are not only financially literate but also financially competent. The second is to devise instructional approaches that more effectively lead young people to put pertinent financial knowledge into practice and to do so correctly when they make financial decisions.

TI  - Consumer financial education and risky financial asset holding in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Risky financial asset holding is arguably a desirable financial behaviour that contributes to consumer financial well-being. However, studies about associations between consumer financial education and risky financial asset holding in China remain limited. To fill this gap, using data from the 2015 China Household Finance Survey, this study examined the association between financial education and risky financial asset holdings and explored its mediators. Results from Probit regressions showed that financial education was positively associated with the household risky financial asset holding. Further analyses based on the mediating model found that financial literacy, economic and financial information search and risk tolerance were mediating factors in the association between financial education and risky financial asset holding. The results have policy implications for improving consumer financial education and financial market participation.

TI  - What You Think You Know: The Effects of Prior Financial Education and Readability on Financial Disclosure Processing
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Disclosures in advertising and other forms of marketing communication have been examined as a means to help consumers understand complex financial information and make more informed decisions regarding financial products and services. The authors extend inquiry into this supposition by looking at the readability of disclosures in relation to consumer financial literacy. In an experiment, it was found that while highly readable disclosures facilitate more accurate information processing for those with prior financial education, such disclosures might actually inhibit accurate processing for those without prior financial education. This suggests that policy cannot rely on mandated disclosure in marketing communications alone. Rather, disclosures in financial product or services communication can only be effective if such disclosures are paired with other forms of education leading to greater financial literacy.

TI  - The Relationship Between Financial Education in Young Adults and Financial Literacy: A Review of the Literature in Canada and the United States
T2  - ACCOUNTING PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Professional accounting bodies in Canada and the United States, and throughout the world, have funded programs to improve financial literacy for many years. This ongoing interest stems from the expected benefits of improved financial behavior for individuals, society, and financial markets. However, the fact that relatively little research on financial literacy has been published in accounting journals suggests that few accounting academics are aware of, interested in, or motivated to work on the topic. This review helps to identify what we know about the effectiveness of financial education programs intended specifically for young adults, who constitute the demographic group likely to gain the most from improved financial literacy. Our review identifies factors that impinge both on the effectiveness of financial education programs and the research examining these programs. Noteworthy factors include (1) a lack of theoretical frameworks to guide the programs and research on the programs, (2) a tendency for outcome measures to capture financial knowledge rather than financial behaviors, and (3) the need for stronger research designs. We also note some possible instructional design considerations in developing financial education programs and highlight financial literacy as a promising area of research for accounting academics. Our findings can help guide improvements to financial education programs and encourage further research to assess the effectiveness of financial literacy programs.

T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB  - Changes in the economy and society lead to a growing necessity of financial education. In this context, we investigate the approaches to financial education in secondary schools in the United States and Germany. We seek to answer the question if and how the implementation of financial education is similar and different between the two countries. We address this question for financial education by comparing the educational conditions, coursework structures, content standards, instructional resources, and assessment within each country. Additionally, we focus on differences in cognitive structure of financial knowledge and understanding among students within each country. For this exploratory analysis, we used data from the Test of Financial Literacy that was administered to students in the United States and Germany (n = 2326). The empirical results reveal differences in knowledge structures in specific content areas among students in the two countries. Possible reasons for such differences and other implications are discussed.

TI  - Informal financial education and consumer financial capability: The mediating role of financial knowledge
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - With the development of the economy, family wealth continues to accumulate, and more and more consumers participate in financial management affairs. As an important way to improve financial knowledge, informal financial education is vital to consumer financial capability. Utilizing data from the 2012, 2015, and 2018 US National Financial Capability Study and the approaches of ordinary least squares and ordered probit regression are employed to produce more accurate estimates. Meanwhile, the study also explores the mediating effects of financial knowledge between informal financial education and consumer financial capability. The results show that informal financial education has a positive effect on the improvement of consumer financial capability. Besides, financial knowledge partially mediates the nexus between informal financial education and consumer financial capability. Therefore, policymakers are encouraged to formulate measures to promote financial education programs not only in schools and universities but also in workplaces or communities. Companies also should offer more opportunities for their employees to receive financial education and further enhance their financial capability. Consumers should be aware of the importance of financial education and actively learn financial knowledge to improve financial capability and further enhance financial satisfaction.

Results revealed a positive association between participation in the education program and changes in financial knowledge levels, even when controlling for demographic and socioeconomic differences between the participant and non-participant groups. However, results did not support an association between perfect attendance in the program and changes in financial knowledge. Evidence from this study provides meaningful insight into the association between adult financial education and financial knowledge and offers guidance for the future development of effective comprehensive workplace financial education programs.

AB  - This paper studies how uncertainty and costs of financial education affect spending on financial literacy. To explore the issue a dynamic stochastic model is employed. We show that the marginal value of financial literacy increases with market volatility, but is hampered by the cost of financial education. A solution is derived for the case of reversible investment. Reversibility increases the fundamental value of financial literacy because of education -related rents.

TI  - Is knowledge powerful? Evidence from financial education and earnings quality
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Previous studies emphasize the importance of investor legal protection on financial reporting quality. We argue that investors' awareness of their legal rights and understanding of the financial products play complementary roles. Financially well-educated investors are more likely to be able to understand investment-related information and less likely to be tricked, hence can pressure managers to eschew misappropriate behavior. This paper explores the role of investor financial education as a corporate governance mechanism in the context of earnings quality. Using data from 43 countries during the sample period of 1994-2012, we find that earnings quality is higher in countries with better financial education after controlling for various institutional environments. Interestingly, the positive effect of financial education on earnings quality exists only in countries with stronger investor legal protection, indicating a complementary role of financial education. Our study provides evidence on the role of financial education in investor protection.

TI  - Financial education affects financial knowledge and downstream behaviors
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We study the rapidly growing literature on the causal effects of financial education programs in a meta-analysis of 76 randomized experiments with a total sample size of over 160,0 0 0 individuals. Many of these experiments are published in top economics and finance journals. The evidence shows that financial education programs have, on average, positive causal treatment effects on financial knowledge and downstream financial behaviors. Treatment effects are economically meaningful in size, similar to those realized by educational interventions in other domains, and robust to accounting for publication bias in the literature. We also discuss the cost-effectiveness of financial education interventions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - ASCENDANCY OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION TO ESCALATE FINANCIAL CAPABILITY OF YOUNG ADULTS: CASE OF PUNJAB, PAKISTAN
T2  - INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT & APPLIED SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - This study assesses the impact of financial education on financial capability (literacy) of young adults in Punjab, Pakistan. Combination of objective financial knowledge, financial attitudes and financial behaviors constructed financial capability. Results indicate that business students are more financially capable than non-business students. The result of the study reveals that Master's degree level education in finance has significant positive impact on financial capability as compared with study of finance in other education levels. The financial education index has highly significant positive impact on financial knowledge, financial attitudes and financial capability index. However, financial education does not improve the financial behaviors of young adults. Moreover, the results also revealed that degree in finance has positive association with financial capability.

TI  - The differential impact of cognitive style on the relationship between financial education and financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - Past studies have examined the role of financial education on financial literacy, often with mixed results. While some studies have shown a positive effect, others have indicated null or even negative effects. Given that much public faith is given to financial education as a means for improving consumers' financial wellbeing, a deeper understanding of the relationship between financial education and financial literacy is needed. A factor that may moderate this important relationship is cognitive style, which reflects the information processing strategies of consumers. At the two extremes of the cognitive style spectrum are analytical and intuitive consumers, and in the intermediate ranges are adaptive consumers who combine analysis and intuition to different degrees. Using a national panel of American consumers, the moderating role that cognitive style plays in this relationship is empirically examined. The findings indicate that while consumers with analytical and intuitive cognitive styles develop higher financial literacy levels as a result of financial education, the financial literacy levels for consumers with adaptive cognitive styles diminishes with financial education. The potential role of self-assessed investment knowledge in this relationship is examined and implications on curriculum design for financial education programs as well as related research needs are discussed.

TI  - THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION IN ADOLESCENT CONSUMERS' FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE ENHANCEMENT
T2  - MARKET-TRZISTE
AB  - Purpose - The aim of this paper was to challenge the purpose of financial education in the context of financial literacy of adolescents, and to test the efficiency of the developed high-school study book and program "My money, my future". Also, the purpose was to identify the predictors of financial knowledge before conducting the workshop, as well as the characteristics of adolescents with best performances on the financial knowledge test.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - The data was collected from a purposive sample of teenagers who participated in "My money, my future" program from October 2016 to February 2018 and the questionnaire employed was a three-part tool.
   Findings and implications - Financial interventions contribute to young people's financial knowledge. Interest, previous financial education and ownership of a bank account were found to be valid and reliable predictors of higher levels of knowledge among teenagers. Furthermore, most high school students in the sample reported they had already engaged in saving behaviour, and more than half of them claimed to have bank accounts. Financial knowledge after the workshop was significant compared to their knowledge before the workshop. Greater knowledge before the workshop led to significantly higher levels of knowledge afterwards. Differences in the levels of financial knowledge were also tested with respect to gender.
   Limitations - The sample only includes high- school students and the research was conducted exclusively on the territory of the Republic of Croatia.
   Originality - The paper emphasized the importance of financial education programs in increasing the level of financial literacy and efficiency of future financial decision making among adolescents.

TI  - Digital vs. in-person financial education: What works best for Generation Z?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Nowadays, financial literacy is one of the most important skills that can be acquired by a tech-savvy Generation Z student. In order to understand what format of financial education works best for Generation Z, we set up an experiment that involved implementing a financial education program called "Futuro Sicuro" with a sample of 650 High School students in Italy. The program allowed us to gather data from two treatments at the class level, namely 1) a traditional financial education simplified program with the presence of a financial advisor, and 2) a digital financial education program using web-based applications based on learning-by-playing concepts. The two treatments were associated with different costs but showed similar effects: three weeks after their conclusion, we find that both courses did increase actual financial knowledge and the results also aligned with participants' realistic assessments of their own financial skills. A follow-up study also reveals the persistence of these effects three months later for the traditional course. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Financial Education Effects on Financial Behavior and Well-Being: The Mediating Roles of Improved Objective and Subjective Financial Knowledge and Parallels in Physical Health
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING
AB  - How does financial education lead to improved financial behavior and higher financial well-being? An influential Consumer Financial Protection Bureau model introduced in 2015 proposes that the goal of financial education is to improve financial well-being and that financial education does so by increasing financial knowledge, which improves financial behavior, which improves financial well-being. In this study, the authors test links in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau model, examining the differential roles of objective and subjective knowledge. They also test whether an analogous model might capture effects of physical health education on physical health knowledge, behavior, and well-being. They report a quasi-experiment comparing changes in financial and physical health knowledge, behavior, and well-being at two time points in a semester for students enrolled in a personal finance class, a personal health class, or neither. This study reports the first causal estimates of flow from financial education to financial knowledge to financial behaviors to a validated measure of subjective financial well-being. Financial education caused large changes in both objective and subjective knowledge. Yet only subjective knowledge mediated the large effects of financial education on changes in downstream behaviors. The authors find weaker but similar results for physical health. The findings suggest that financial education efforts should be refocused to foster subjective knowledge and improved behavior.

TI  - Financial Behavior Change and Progress Toward Self-Sufficiency: A Goal-Framing Theory Application
T2  - EMERGING ADULTHOOD
AB  - We applied goal-framing theory to determine whether there were discernible patterns in emerging adults' financial behavior from college to career and whether those patterns were associated with progress toward self-sufficiency. Using longitudinal data collected over 5 years from a college cohort of emerging adults (N = 968) in the United States, we estimated latent growth curve models and identified three financial-behavior patterns suggestive of the overarching motivations in the theory: planful (gain), present focused (hedonic), and socially compliant (normative). Using multinomial logistic regression analysis, we found that higher perceived financial control, more positive financial attitudes, higher perceived parental expectations, and more exposure to financial education were predictive of a gain pattern. Analyses of variance showed that the gain financial-behavior pattern was associated with the most progress toward self-sufficiency (adult stability, career status, and well-being). We discuss the findings as they pertain to the connection between emerging adults' financial behavior and progress toward self-sufficiency.

TI  - Bringing Voluntary Financial Education in Emerging Economy: Role of Financial Socialization During Elementary Years
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC EDUCATION RESEARCHER
AB  - The level of financial literacy tends to be low in children, while information and financial education for children are very limited, especially in developing countries without mandatory financial education in schools. This study examined the effects of a classroom financial education program on financial knowledge. We used "Financial Intelligence Curriculum" designed for elementary school students from grade 1-6, focusing on the need and want, priority needs, income, spending, saving, and sharing. Using experimental method with pre-post-test and control group design, we found that the treatment group who received financial education has improved financial knowledge relative to the control group. The study provides evidence that elementary school students are appropriate targets for financial education and that it is necessary to develop mechanisms for effective learning to improve financial capability at an early age.

TI  - Diversification opportunities in European stock markets and their impact on textile industry development based on a financial education approach
T2  - INDUSTRIA TEXTILA
AB  - This research study explores the diversification opportunity among 18 European stock market indices for the sample period from January 2001 to December 2019. However, financial education plays an important role in the development of the textile industry, considering the dynamics of the companies listed on the European stock exchanges. The correlation matrix, pairwise cointegration and Johansen cointegration reveal that selected 18 European stock market indices do not reduces the portfolio risk because exhibit higher positive correlation among them, and their movement pulsed in tandem. Potential investors are attracted by high investment opportunities in order to maximize their return based on portfolio diversification. Financial education can effectively contribute to the sustainable growth of the textile industry in Europe. This empirical research provides an integrated perspective on the long-term evolution of certain major European stock exchange indices. The findings have significant implications for investors interested in selecting these European stock indices in order to diversify their portfolio risk. Our study also imply that selected stock indices have been strongly affected by similar political and financial belies across Europe thus, eliminating the possibility of portfolio risk diversification.

TI  - Evaluating Deliberative Competence: A Simple Method with an Application to Financial Choice
T2  - AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - We examine methods for evaluating interventions designed to improve decision-making quality when people misunderstand the consequences of their choices. In an experiment involving financial education, conventional outcome metrics ( financial literacy and directional behavioral responses) imply that two interventions are equally beneficial even though only one reduces the average severity of errors. We trace these failures to violations of the assumptions embedded in the conventional metrics. We propose a simple, intui-tive, and broadly applicable outcome metric that properly differen-tiates between the interventions, and is robustly interpretable as a measure of welfare loss from misunderstanding consequences even when additional biases distort choices.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of sociodemographic characteristics and financial education on saving behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY
AB  - Purpose The objective of this study is to explore the effects of financial literacy level and risk aversion on the saving behavior. The literature review showed dialectical results. Therefore, this study attempts to clarify the debatable of these results by studying the mediating effect of risk aversion on the relationships between demographics determinants and saving behavior moderated by the effect of the financial literacy level. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from the University of Normandy; the study sample included 516 respondents representing different segments of French households. The structural equation analysis was utilized to control the impact of financial literacy as a moderate variable and the risk aversion as a mediator variable among the link between sociodemographic factors and saving behavior. Findings The results demonstrated that there were significant effects of demographics factors on risk aversion. Moreover, financial literacy moderates the relationships between risk aversion and saving behavior. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of this research is the small size of the study sample. This paper is restricted to French households. Future financial education training should cover the European context. Practical implications This study provides further evidence that financial literacy should be considered an important factor for improving household well-being. The paper encourages governments and financial institutions to create a national financial education program. Originality/value This paper is the first attempt to employ a sample of low-income households after financial education training in the French context.

TI  - Assessing the impact of financial education programs: A quantitative model
T2  - ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW
AB  - Prior studies disagree regarding the effectiveness of financial education programs, especially those offered in the workplace. To explain such measurement differences in evaluation and outcomes, we employ a stochastic life cycle model with endogenous financial knowledge accumulation and investigate how financial education programs optimally shape key economic outcomes. This approach permits us to measure how such programs shape wealth accumulation, financial knowledge, and participation in sophisticated assets (e.g. stocks) across heterogeneous consumers. We apply conventional program evaluation econometric techniques to simulated data, distinguishing selection and treatment effects. We show that the more effective programs provide follow-up in order to sustain the knowledge acquired by employees via the program; in such an instance, financial education delivered to employees around the age of 40 can raise savings at retirement by close to 10%. By contrast, one-time education programs do produce short-term but few long-term effects. We also measure how accounting for selection affects estimates of program effectiveness for those who participate. Comparisons of participants and non-participants can be misleading, even using a difference-in-difference strategy when the common-trend assumption is unlikely to hold. Random program assignment is needed to evaluate program effects on those who participate.

TI  - The causal mechanism of financial education: Evidence from mediation analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - This paper uses a field experiment in India and mediation analysis to investigate the causal mechanisms between financial education and financial behavior. Focusing on the mediating role of financial literacy, we propose a broader definition of financial knowledge that includes three dimensions: numeracy skills, financial awareness, and attitudes towards personal finance. We then employ causal mediation analysis to investigate the proportion of the treatment effect that can be attributed to these three channels. Strikingly, we find that numeracy does not mediate any effects of financial education on financial outcomes. For simple financial actions such as budgeting, both awareness and attitudes serve as pathways, while for more complex financial activities such as opening a savings account, attitudes play a more prominent role-though these patterns appear to be sensitive to confounding. We also compare our mediation analysis results to other empirical techniques that have been typically used to study mechanisms, and we discuss how mediation analysis differs from these approaches.

TI  - Student loan debt and financial education: a qualitative analysis of resident perceptions and implications for resident well-being
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE
AB  - High educational debt is prevalent among resident physicians and correlates with adverse well-being outcomes, including symptoms of stress and burnout. Residents also report low financial literacy levels, affecting financial well-being. Understanding resident viewpoints toward financial well-being initiatives is crucial to develop targeted resident financial well-being programs. This study aims to examine residents' experiences financing their medical education and how these experiences influence well-being and attitudes toward financial education in residency. We recruited residents from a Southern California health system with residency programs in Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery, and Psychiatry. We contacted residents by email and text message to participate in semi-structured interviews. We conducted interviews from October 2020 to March 2021 and analyzed 59 resident interviews using reflexive thematic analysis. Among residents, 76% (45/59) had >= $200,000 in student loans. Residents perceived mounting medical education debt as unfairly burdensome for trainees engaged in socially beneficial work, leaving residents feeling undervalued - a feeling heightened by the stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic - and hampering well-being. Compartmentalizing debt attenuated financial stressors but often made financial education seem less pressing. A subset of residents described how financial planning restored some agency and enhanced well-being, noting that protected didactic time for financial education was crucial. Resident interviews provide practical guidance regarding designing financial education sessions. Desired education included managing debt, retirement planning, and the business of medicine. How residents framed educational debt and their degree of financial literacy impacted their well-being and sense of agency. Residents proposed that residency programs can aid in stress mitigation by providing residents with skills to help manage debt and plan for retirement. To reduce clinician indebtedness, this approach needs to occur in tandem with systemic changes to financing medical education.

TI  - Undergraduate student financial education interventions: Medium term evidence of retention, decay, and confidence in financial literacy
T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - University is a significant transition period for young adults as they seek and gain independence, including financial independence. This would appear an ideal teachable moment for delivering financial education, though evidence of financial education intervention outcomes is mixed. We report medium-term empirical evidence, three years after the completion of an undergraduate personal finance semester-length unit, evidence notably absent in the literature. We find students retain significant objective and subjective financial literacy effects, with modest decay, three years after completing a unit of personal finance education. Effects on behavior and behavior intentions are less robust over time as boosts reported immediately after completion dissipate three years hence, though in absolute terms positive behaviors remain high. We found little evidence to link completion of a unit of study with overconfidence, as has previously been suggested, and students overall appear more discerning in their search for financial information sources after the unit.

TI  - IMPROVING FINANCIAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
T2  - ECONOMICS ECOLOGY SOCIUM
AB  - Introduction. Modern society has long agreed that financial education is one of the pillars of its sustainable development. In many countries, action plans were prepared, strategies developed, training courses were aimed at increasing the level of financial education, but after a few years it is again clear that the problem has not been solved, there are very few examples of success and it is not known whether these successes are the result of the above measures. The need of change the strategies in place today in financial education is slowly emerging. There is an urgent task of improving the strategy of financial education at the present stage of development of society.
   Aim and tasks. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the current financial education strategy on the example of one particular country - Georgia, its logical consequences and find the levers that will make this strategy more effective or outline the contours of the new strategy.
   Results. The results of the work done in Georgia in the field of financial education over the past six years were analyzed. Comparison of the stated goals and actual results of the current strategies of financial education is carried out. The study is based on the analysis of the determinants of financial behavior of human, the main postulates of behavioral economics. The methods of logical generalization, synthesis, analysis and deduction are widely used in the research to reveal the cause-and-effect relationship between mental models of thinking, financial education and financial stability of the individual. Also examined the development policy measures adopted by the World Bank. An assessment of their relevance for improving financial education is carried out. The importance of considering mental models of thinking in achieving goals set in various spheres of society was noticed. Also, as a result of the analysis, new approaches were identified that improve the strategy of financial education.
   Conclusions. Strategies need to be developed based on the mental models of the population of a particular country taking into account the psychological aspects that are significant for the members of a given community. It is necessary to process the information provided by the population, not only semantically, but also etymologically, within the framework of the measures outlined in the strategy and use categories in the context to which the society is more sensitive. More successful examples of financial education development policies need to be considered.

TI  - Cash plus: exploring the mechanisms through which a cash transfer plus financial education programme in Tanzania reduced HIV risk for adolescent girls and young women
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY
AB  - Introduction: Cash transfers have been promoted as a means to reduce HIV risk for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the main mechanisms whereby they are hypothesized to reduce risk is by deterring transactional sex. In this paper, we use qualitative methods to explore participant experiences, perspectives and reported behaviours of a cash transfer plus financial education programme among out of school, 15- to 23-year-old AGYWs in rural Tanzania with a focus on partner choice and transactional sex.
   Methods: We conducted 60 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and 20 narrative timeline interviews with participants of the PEPFAR DREAMS Sauti/WORTH+ cash transfer programme between June 2017 and July 2018. Interviews were taped, transcribed and translated from Kiswahili to English. Transcripts were coded and analysed for key themes.
   Results: We found that participants in a cash transfer plus programme discussed behaviours that could reduce HIV risk through decreasing their dependence on male sex partners. There appeared to be two main mechanisms for this. One, young women discussed the cash transfer providing for basic needs (e.g. food, toiletries) which appeared to reduce their dependence on male sex partners who previously provided these goods (e.g. transactional sex). This experience was more pronounced among the poorest participants. Two, young women discussed how the financial education/business development aspect of the programme empowered them to refuse some sex partners; unmarried women discussed these experiences more than married women. Social support from family and programme mentors appeared to strengthen young women's ability to successful start businesses, produce income and thus be less dependent on partners.
   Conclusions: The cash transfer programme may have reduced AGYW engagement in transactional sex that occurred to meet basic needs (one form of transactional sex). The financial education/business development and mentorship elements of the programme appeared important in building AGYW agency, self-esteem and future orientation which may support AGYWs in refusing unwanted sex partners. Future cash plus programmes should consider adding or strengthening financial education and job skills training, mentorship and future orientation to see stronger and perhaps sustainable outcomes for HIV prevention.

TI  - The ABCs of Financial Education: Experimental Evidence on Attitudes, Behavior, and Cognitive Biases
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - This paper uses a large-scale field experiment in India to study attitudinal, behavioral, and cognitive constraints that can stymie the link between financial education and financial outcomes. The study complements financial education with (i) financial incentives on a financial literacy test to affect participant motivation, (ii) financial goal setting to provide a psychological nudge, and (iii) personalized financial counseling to enhance the intensity of treatment. The analysis finds no impact of financial incentives on learning but significant effects of both goal setting and counseling on real financial outcomes. These results identify important complements to financial education that can bridge the gap between financial knowledge and behavior change.

AB  - Financial literacy has been recognised as a vital life skill, but there is little evidence of the factors behind the differences in managing personal finance. Socio-economic factors and the provision of financial education do explain the variance in financial literacy in some countries, but not in all. In the PISA 2012 financial literacy test, Estonian students ranked very highly in international comparison; although only a few had received financial education at school. Compared with other countries, socio-economic factors explained the smallest proportion of variance in the test score. There was, however, a significant difference between the mean financial literacy scores of Estonian- and Russian-language communities. The aim of the article is to analyse the factors behind the differences in financial literacy when financial education is not provided. It also offers insight into how students in a similar education system in two different cultural and language frameworks achieve different financial literacy scores. Moreover, the results demonstrate how indicators, such as family background can work through different channels as opposed to the usual parental education or occupation based socio-economic indicators. The latter implies that unexplained factors remain, such as cultural, developmental and societal indicators, which most researchers pay little attention to when explaining efficient policies for improving financial literacy. Multivariate regression models show that the level of financial literacy in Estonia is correlated with gender, language of the school, the number of books at home, mathematics and reading scores. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition explains less than half of the gap between the two communities. The only variable significantly explaining the gap is the number of books at home. Books can be interpreted as a symbol of social status, evidence of cultural background or source of influence for broader picture and better problem solving skills.

TI  - A latent profile analysis of college students' financial knowledge: The role of financial education, financial well-being, and financial risk tolerance
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR BUSINESS
AB  - This research aims to classify college students into meaningful groups based on their subjective financial knowledge (SFK), objective financial knowledge (OFK), and comparative financial knowledge (CFK) using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA). LPA captures underlying dynamics within the grouping variables and compares group differences. Results of LPA suggest three groups of college students in the sample, and the groups differed in levels of financial well-being (FWB), financial risk tolerance (FRT), and financial education experience (FEE).

TI  - Impact of Social factors, Self-control, and Financial Education on Financial Literacy and Financial Saving Behaviour among University Students in Saudi Arabia
T2  - EURASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH
AB  - The primary research objective aimed to empirically assess the influence of peer influence, self-control, financial education, and parental influence on the financial saving behaviour mediated through the financial literacy of university students in Saudi Arabia. A sample of 260 students participated in the study, selected using purposive sampling, and data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. The study employed a quantitative research approach with a cross-sectional research design. The empirical regression results revealed positive and statistically significant impacts of parental and peer influences, financial education, and self-control on financial literacy. Mediation analyses further indicated a significant mediating effect of financial literacy in the relationship between peer influence, self-control, parental influence, financial education, and financial saving behaviour. Drawing from the aforementioned study, the research contributes insights endorsing financial education initiatives and collaborative endeavours among stakeholders to cultivate a holistic environment conducive to financial literacy. The study contributes theoretically by incorporating financial education and self-control into established frameworks and practically by advocating curriculum reforms within Saudi Arabian universities. Limitations encompass the study's singular country focus and the absence of moderating variables, prompting a call for future research to delve into cultural variations, introduce moderators, and adopt mixed-method approaches for a more comprehensive understanding.

TI  - Financial Education and Financial Access for Transnational Households: Field Experimental Evidence from the Philippines
T2  - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE
AB  - We implemented a randomized controlled trial among transnational households in the Philippines estimating impacts of a financial education treatment, a financial access treatment, and the combination of the two on financial behaviors. We test whether there are complementarities between both interventions and provide insight into the nature of constraints operating in financial services markets. We find no evidence of complementarities between the financial education and access treatments. In addition, while we find no evidence of constraints in access to formal credit and savings products, our results suggest that access constraints exist in the formal insurance market. Impacts on other financial behaviors are suggestive of the importance of information constraints in financial decision-making. These results provide guidance to designers of financial interventions in similar populations.

TI  - Is Financial Education Positively Associated with Consumer Stock Market Satisfaction? Evidence from China
T2  - DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB  - This study aims to investigate the associations between financial education and consumer stock market satisfaction. Consumer financial education is measured through the objective aspect incorporating formal and informal financial knowledge education, and the subjective aspect is reflected through consumers' attitudes toward financial education. Using data from China's urban consumers, the results indicate a positive association between financial education and consumer stock market satisfaction. The findings suggest that consumers who were financially literate at high schools or colleges are more satisfied in participating in the stock market. Moreover, consumers who spend more money and time, as well as those who think financial education is more important, feel more satisfied in participating in stock market investment activities. The results imply that it is necessary to increase the supply of formal financial education in high schools and universities, encourage consumers to invest more in the informal education of financial knowledge, and promote policymakers to formulate informative policies to make consumers aware of the importance of financial education.

TI  - Do heuristics matter for financial literacy? The impact of better heuristics awareness to financial literacy
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Policymakers are increasingly focused on improving citizens' financial well-being through better financial literacy. Traditional strategies emphasize financial education to boost financial knowledge, while recently behavioural-based education focus on issues like behavioural biases and emotional influences. This paper suggests a randomized controlled-study to assess if financial education including lessons on heuristics (availability and gambler's fallacy) enhances financial literacy. Results showed that traditional financial education significantly improved financial literacy, while adding heuristics had effect close to zero. This suggests expanding curricula to address rules-of-thumb may not necessarily improve financial literacy, challenging the notion that more complex financial education is always beneficial.

TI  - The Influence of Government Dimension on Financial Education and Empowerment of Micro-, Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The study examines the influence of the five pillars of inclusive financing on the empowerment of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and the influence of institutional conditions on the empowerment of MSMEs. This study uses primary and secondary data. The population of the study are MSMEs; the is a total of 930,620 MSMEs in Jakarta. Owners of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises is a good population to be measured because they are the main actors that know exactly the challenges and the obstacles in doing business addressing problems faced in inclusive financing, which is related to the purpose of the study. The research borrows from finance and entrepreneurial theories for model design. The results of the study show that all the variables are significant and positive in the efforts to finance MSMEs in Indonesia, which means that financial education plays an important role in the sustainability of financial inclusion. The financial theory, developed to explain financing at the company level, needs to be adapted to the entrepreneurial situation, so that it can explain the behavior of small businesses. This means that, with correct financial knowledge, financial inclusion plays an important role in the sustainability of MSMEs in Indonesia.

TI  - The financial education of the Eurozone
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN INTEGRATION
AB  - 'The Financial Education of the Eurozone' is both a story of global markets forcing political leaders to take unpalatable steps to reinforce their monetary union, and a dawning realization that if there is to be further integration it will have to come through reinforcing the interdependence of the euro area's markets and banks. This study examines the historical logic behind the establishment of the euro, shows how fiscal and monetary backstops took shape amid the market turmoil and explores the nascent effort to impose structural reform. Finally, it outlines how European-level supervision and regulation of banks and capital markets have significantly bolstered the currency union and urges further progress on these reforms as the best hope for further progress during the current populist moment.

TI  - An Assessment Tool to Identify the Financial Literacy Level of Financial Education Programs Participants' Executed by Ecuadorian Financial Institutions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Due to the lack of a tool assessing the effectiveness of Financial Education Programs (FEP) imparted by the financial institutions (FI) in Ecuador by mandate, this research proposes and validates a scale to evaluate the Financial Literacy (FL) level of 314 participants (15-50 years old) after attending an FEP. The final 18-item FL scale, compounded with Financial Attitude, Financial Knowledge, and Financial Behavior dimensions, is reliable and robust according to the Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The average score for FL is 76 out of 100 points. The youngest scored the lowest, and the FI employees the highest. This contribution fulfills a needed FL scale to accurately measure the efforts of FI spreading the FE. It serves as a stepping stone for further research reconfirming its validity and applying the proposed FI's FL scale as a pre-post FL evaluation.

TI  - TOWARDS FINANCIAL LITERACY: A CASE OF SLOVAKIA
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - The level of financial literacy in the Slovak Republic has long been below the European Union average, which is confirmed by several surveys in recent years. In practice, this creates several problems. Almost a million Slovaks have at least one foreclosure, resulting from buying necessities on credit and then living in ever-increasing debt. Knowledge of finance and business among employees or budding entrepreneurs is also problematic. Conservative Slovaks also keep most of their money in products with zero interest and are afraid to invest and capitalize on their savings. The National Bank of Slovakia and the Slovak Bank Association have been calling for a change in school curricula for a long time because financially illiterate pupils eventually become poorly literate clients. The contribution's primary purpose was to analyze the state of financial education in secondary schools in the Slovak Republic, including a more effective design of the content and method of teaching financial literacy. More effective financial education could help reduce poverty in Slovakia and more effective financial and business literacy in society.

TI  - The Case for the Need for Personal Financial Literacy Education in Botswana Secondary Schools
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - Personal financial literacy (PFL) is an imperative life skill that all 21 st-century students should have. Research shows that the levels of financial literacy in both developing and developed countries are very low across people of all ages. This deplorable state of affairs has negative implications on the well-being of the populace, as evidenced by increased indebtedness, lower saving, poor planning for retirement, and the making of many poor personal financial decisions. Recognizing the potential benefits of financial literacy at both individual and national levels, many countries have started to offer financial education in their schools. This article analyzed the business subjects' curriculum at secondary school level in Botswana and literature published on the subject of PFL, and found that there exists a gap in this area and a need to offer PFL to all learners in the school system. Despite the need for such a move, Botswana does not have a deliberate program in its curriculum that specifically addresses this problem. This article discusses the benefits of personal financial education, the inadequacy of current business subjects to meet this need, and concludes by recommending a mandatory PFL subject in the Botswana secondary school curriculum.

TI  - Investigating alternative avenues for financial behaviour change: moving beyond the traditional approach
T2  - YOUNG CONSUMERS
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to explore possible behavioural change venues, beyond the traditional approach to financial education, using the capability-opportunity-motivation behaviour theoretical framework of behavioural change.Design/methodology/approachThe study included 45, semi-structured, in-depth interviews of young adults to explore which elements of financial behaviour formation should interventions target to be effective.FindingsTo strengthen capability, the study recommends behavioural education and training for boosting financial knowledge and skills, enablement of financial independence and modelling for empowering self-control and reducing impulsiveness. To boost motivation, gamification of modelling is advised for boosting responsible financial behaviour as part of the identity and inducing consideration of future consequences. Persuasion is advised for inducing positive emotions while incentivization and coercion are advised for empowering self-conscious intentions. To rise opportunity, the study proposes incentivization and coercion imposed by parents, and governmental efforts regarding restriction, enablement and environmental restructuring.Practical implicationsThe study brings recommendations for developing efficient interventions for strengthening responsible financial behaviour that may help design type-specific education programmes to promote responsible financial behaviour.Originality/valueThe present study attempts to explore new venues in intervention design that break away from the traditional approach of financial education focused on knowledge and skills that is proven to be ineffective

TI  - Education and Financial Inclusion. An Empirical Study in Students of Higher Education
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - Financial products and services are increasingly present in our daily lives, so it is very important to know the advantages that can be obtained by using them. In this way, the present study seeks to determine the existence of an underlying structure that explains the knowledge towards the topics of Income, Money Management, Savings and Investment, Expenditure and Credit in students of higher education. For this, the Financial Education Test was applied to 126 participants. The results obtained through the exploratory factor analysis provide evidence of the existence of a structure that allows us to understand the phenomenon of financial education in the perception, knowledge, use and application of financial topics in Mexican students. Two factors represent 68.18 % of the phenomenon under study, the first on knowledge, use and application towards savings and investment (37.42 % of the total variance explained) and the second on knowledge, use and application about money management (30.75 % of the total variance explained).

TI  - Readability of Korean-Language advertising disclosures moderates knowledge effects
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose Government policy mandates information disclosure in financial communications to protect consumer welfare. Unfortunately, low readability can hamper information disclosures' meaningful benefits to financial decision making. Thus, this experiment tests the product evaluation and decision satisfaction of Korean consumers with less or more subjective knowledge and with or without personal finance education. Design/methodology/approach A between-subjects experiment examined responses of a nationally representative sample of 400 Korean consumers toward a Korean-language credit card advertisement. Findings Financial knowledge improves financial product evaluation and decision satisfaction. More readable disclosures improved evaluation and satisfaction among less knowledgeable consumers. Less readable disclosures did not. Consumers without financial education exhibited lower evaluations and decision satisfaction regardless of readability. More knowledgeable consumers and those with financial education performed equally well regardless of disclosure readability. Practical implications Financial service providers seeking more accurate evaluations and better decision satisfaction among their customers should use easier-to-read disclosures when targeting consumers with less prior financial knowledge. Social implications One-size-fits-all financial communications are unlikely to achieve public policy or consumer well-being goals. Government-mandated information should be complemented by augmenting financial knowledge and providing personal finance training. Originality/value Although almost a quarter of the world's population lives in East Asia, this is the first examination of readability in disclosures written in East Asian characters rather than a Western alphabet. Previous readability research on Asian-originating financial disclosures has been conducted on English-language texts. This study extends knowledge of readability effects to growing East Asian markets.

TI  - The Most Suitable Topic of Personal Finance Education University Students: Study Case in Indonesia
T2  - QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB  - The aim of this research is to identify the most suitable topic to discuss in Personal Finance course for university student. Mostly financial education curricula that available worldwide is for children elementary school up to senior high school. Rarely people provide formal financial education that specific for university student. While Indonesia itself has no formal financial education either for children or university student. This research collected data using triangulation (questionnaire and in-deep-interview) found that there were five main topics as the most important topic to learn personal finance for university student in Indonesia. Several parties become the sample of this research. We collect adult financial problems, student expectation and independent financial advisor suggestion. Total 844 participant fill in the questionnaire and 10 independent financial advisors has become the sample of this research. Content analysis has been done using coding and classification to summarize and synthesis data from three point of view. Then we found 5 topics that the most important for university student to learn about personal finance. There was financial planning, expense management, saving, investment and debt. This research implication is for policy maker to focus and develop five most crucial topics for university student to learn about personal finance, and do not teach only interest, compounding interest and mathematical things in personal finance.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - We explore a unique dataset on individual investors' online trading accounts to examine the determinants of their attention and its relation to portfolio performance. In particular, we investigate what individual characteristics affect investor attention and what type of information drives investment performance. We find distinct differences in investors' attention and provide evidence that paying attention has a differential impact on performance depending on the type of information. Portfolio monitoring and attention to financial education are positively related to performance, while attention to analytical information is detrimental to performance. Attention to technical analysis is negatively related to the performance of actively trading investors but improves the performance of less frequent traders. Overall, our results provide additional evidence to the suggestion that attention to financial education is the key to investment success.

TI  - Do bank credit rejection and financial education affect financial self-confidence?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR & RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the determinants of owner manager financial self-confidence. In particular, it estimates the effect of bank credit rejection and financial education (FE) on the financial self-confidence of business owners.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses data from 2004 and 2008 surveys of 2,500 UK small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). An ordered probit estimation is used to measure and assess the effect of bank credit rejection and FE variables on financial self-confidence for the two periods. The authors also explore potential differences in self-confidence between males and females.
   Findings - The results show that outright bank credit rejection reduces financial self-confidence among owner managers whereas partial bank credit rejection is found to help boost confidence prior to the financial crisis. There is strong evidence that FE increases financial self-confidence. Finally, the authors find no association between gender and reported self-confidence in finance.
   Research limitations/implications - Entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs are encouraged to explore financial literacy and knowledge with a view to increasing their financial self-confidence. This will help SMEs to deal with the banks or other finance providers more efficiently. In addition, better application procedures and information on lending criteria may help SMEs to minimize the probability of bank credit rejection. So the current study has implications for professional bodies as well. The study, however, is restricted to sole proprietor and partnership SMEs and in the UK context only.
   Practical implications - Financial self-confidence has a progressive effect on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial venture growth. The financial self-confidence of owner managers can support their entrepreneurial capability in starting and operating one or more businesses. As entrepreneurs successfully start and operate their own businesses, they are contributing to economic development through job creation, employment and tax contribution.
   Originality/value - This paper makes an original contribution in highlighting the usefulness of FE in boosting financial self-confidence among entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs. It is also found that the experience of bank credit rejection reduces entrepreneurs' financial self-confidence.

TI  - Substantial innovation or strategic innovation: An evolutionary game analysis of companies' green technology innovation strategies under carbon emission trading market
T2  - MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS
AB  - Although both the carbon emission trading market (CETM) and government regulatory actions promote companies' green technology innovation (GTI), little research has considered whether such innovation is substantial. In this paper, we categorize companies' GTI strategies into substantial innovation and strategic innovation. Considering market powers, the heterogeneity of companies, and the mutual influence of governments and companies, we construct a tripartite evolutionary game model that involves large and small companies and the government and conduct a simulation utilizing data on China's CETM. Our findings reveal that carbon trading prices, innovation subsidies, and the government's verification mechanism are the main factors that affect companies' choices regarding substantial innovation. However, the current carbon trading prices in China are relatively low, and companies are still likely to choose strategic innovation. Moreover, we find that when the substantial innovation of large companies exerts a greater impact on the product revenues of small companies, small companies are more inclined to choose substantial innovation. Therefore, in an effort to induce companies to choose substantial innovation, the CETM should play the leading role in this situation, and the government should implement different innovation subsidies and improve the verification mechanism.

TI  - Prudent Financial Management Practices among Malaysian Youth: The Moderating Roles of Financial Education
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The study aims to investigate the roles of financial education (FE) as a moderator to financial attitude (FA), parental financial socialisation (PFS), and financial literacy (FL) to ensure the success of prudent financial management practices (PFMP) among Malaysian youth. The study was designed quantitatively and employed self-administered questionnaires, which were adopted from previous studies and distributed to 480 youths in Malaysia. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test hypotheses of the study. The results showed FA, PFS and FL have significant and positive relationship with PFMP. However, as regards moderating interaction of FE, results showed that FE does not significantly moderate the relationship between FA, PFS and FL with PFMP. The results further highlighted serious concerns on the effectiveness of FE towards improving youth capability in managing their financial affairs prudently. This proved that mandated FE prior to graduation has less effect and does not lead to behavior changes among Malaysian youth. It shows the challenges faced by the country stakeholders to strengthen FE, enhance the effectiveness and encompass the right FE elements to ensure today's young Malaysians are able to apply what they learned in the classroom to their real life.

TI  - A goal-driven framework for compliance-dependent services: Pathways to customer satisfaction and well-being
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - To address the prevailing low customer compliance rate in service programs, this study presents a goal-driven framework to explain the underlying motivational mechanisms of customer compliance and how compliance influences customers' goal achievement as well as customer satisfaction and well-being. The results from a twowave longitudinal survey of credit counseling clients yielded four primary findings. First, compliance is driven by customers' commitment to their pre-set goals in addition to their commitment to the relationship with the service organization. Second, compliance enhances customer well-being via customers' goal achievement. Next, compliance, regardless of goal achievement, serves as a direct source of customer satisfaction. Finally, goal commitment gradually loses its motivational power when customers are progressing toward their program goals. The findings suggest that service providers need to help customers set and maintain a program goal to facilitate compliance and goal achievement since they are the determinants of customer satisfaction and personal wellbeing.

TI  - Can FinTech Applied to Payments Improve Consumer Financial Satisfaction? Evidence from the USA
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - The rapid development of financial technology (FinTech) has profoundly affected consumers' financial life, especially their financial satisfaction. The advancement of FinTech has given momentum to the development of mobile payments to some extent. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of FinTech applied to payments on consumer financial satisfaction utilizing data from the U.S. 2015 and 2018 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS). The method of probit regression is utilized to perform more accurate estimates since the variable of consumer financial satisfaction is non-continuous and ordered. The empirical results of this study indicate that FinTech positively contributes to consumer financial satisfaction. In addition, this study selects financial education and financial capability as mediating variables to explore the possible influence channels between the development of mobile payments and the increase in consumer financial satisfaction. The mediating effects analysis demonstrates that FinTech positively affects financial education and financial capability, ultimately increasing consumer financial satisfaction. These findings have implications for consumer policymakers when promoting FinTech to consumers and helping them increase their financial satisfaction through mobile payments.

TI  - MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS IN FINANCE EDUCATION: CLUSTER ANALYSIS FOR OECD COUNTRIES
T2  - MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS
AB  - Financial literacy and financial education is a concept that helps people in orientation in both the financial markets and the area of personal finances. Financial literacy can be acknowledged through financial education. Financial education should enable individuals to develop their decision-making competencies. It includes issues such are the understanding of money, how to deal with them within the risk of their investment. The issue of financial literacy for primary and secondary school students has been monitored over a long time through several evaluations. In this case, it is very well known the PISA rating, which was lastly performed in the first half of 2018. It represents the ability of how to use skills and knowledge in managing one's financial resources while achieving maximum prosperity. Financial education should enable individuals to develop their decision-making competencies related to money. The paper aims to perform a cluster analysis based on the data available from the PISA 2015 measurement in selected OECD countries. The analysis represents results in a cluster of countries. The study analysed of financial literacy 15-year-olds students. The study observed similar research results in both the area of financial literacy and mathematical literacy. From the selected PISA 2015 test results applied through cluster analysis, we decided that the Slovak students were placed in a cluster together with students from Spain, Chile and Lithuania. The study observed the quality of vocational education and training is criticized mainly by employers because the area of education is inadequately responsive to labour market needs. Employee stress that it is inadequately linked to practice. Vocational training is inadequate compared to general schools. The methodology we recommend should also be applied to the results of the PISA 2018 evaluation, which are not yet available to the public. We would like to address this issue in future. The cluster analysis helps to reveal competitiveness in the area of financial literacy. The results of our research within Slovak students were based on a similar level of financial literacy among Slovak pupils as in Spain, Chile and Lithuania.

TI  - Personal finance blogs: Helpful tool for consumers with low financial literacy or preaching to the choir?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Recent transitions from defined benefit to defined contribution plans assign greater individual responsibility to consumers to prepare for retirement and make consequential financial choices. However, many consumers are ill-equipped to do so, considering overall low levels of financial literacy. At the same time, there is increasing controversy about the effectiveness of traditional financial education, such as high school financial education, counselling and seminars or workshops. Alternative sources of (just-in-time) financial training or advice may be needed to financially empower consumers and help them make important financial decisions. In the light of these developments, this study investigates if consumers perceive personal finance blogs as a helpful alternative in acquiring financial knowledge, and which factors influence perceived helpfulness of and intention to use personal finance blogs. Using Structural Equation Modelling to analyse data from a sample of U.S. consumers, the results of this study uncover that financial literacy and susceptibility to informational influence have a significant positive association with perceived helpfulness. Perceived financial uncertainty, which refers to uncertainty in terms of consumers' perceived ability to accurately predict their future financial needs, has a significant negative association with perceived helpfulness of and intention to use personal finance blogs. Finally, perceived helpfulness of a personal finance blog is a significant positive predictor of consumers' intention to use it. Overall, the findings suggest that personal finance blogs are preaching to the choir, since the consumers who are most likely to use personal finance blogs seem to need them the least given their higher levels of financial literacy and lower levels of perceived financial uncertainty. Taken together, the findings shed light on the potential users of personal finance blogs and underline the challenges of a one-size-fits-all' financial education. This study aids in assessing personal finance blogs as an online resource which is scarcely researched, but which has the potential to provide just-in-time financial education to consumers across the world.

TI  - A Social-Cognitive Model of Consumer Well-Being: A Longitudinal Exploration of the Role of the Service Organization
T2  - JOURNAL OF SERVICE RESEARCH
AB  - This study establishes a social-cognitive model of consumer well-being to explain the psychological mechanism underlying the relationships between service organizations' marketing strategies and consumer well-being. Using a two-wave longitudinal design, we surveyed 168 clients from a major credit counseling organization. Results show that organizational strategies influence consumers' domain-specific well-being via social-cognitive variables (including self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and process expectations) and goal-pursuit processes (both goal setting and goal striving). Specifically, organizational strategies, including organizational support and organizational socialization, contribute to consumers' goal intentions both directly and indirectly via outcome and process expectations at the goal-setting stage. In the goal-striving stage, goal intention leads to goal achievement, a path strengthened by organizational support. Goal achievement contributes to increases in consumers' domain-specific well-being. Customers who are in the early or late stages of a service program are more likely to fail in achieving their goals than those who are in the middle of the program. This study sheds new light on transformative service research by demonstrating the role of the service organization in enhancing consumer well-being and suggests that service strategies should focus on shaping consumers' social cognitions and facilitating their pursuit of valued personal goals.

TI  - Young Adults' Life Outcomes and Well-Being: Perceived Financial Socialization from Parents, the Romantic Partner, and Young Adults' Own Financial Behaviors
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - We examined how perceived financial socialization-from parents, the romantic partner, and young adults' own behavior-was associated with young adults' life outcomes and well-being (i.e., physical and mental health, finances, romantic relationship). Using data (N = 504) from young adults specific to their finances, results from hierarchical regression analyses showed that young adults' own financial behaviors were the most patterned, followed by financial socialization from the romantic partner, and then from financial socialization from parents (only objective financial knowledge). We discuss how young adults' financial behavior, financial socialization from the romantic partner and, to a lesser extent, parental socialization are associated with young adults' life domains, underscoring the developmental salience of increased financial capability and relationship formation and decreased dependence on parents during the transition to adulthood.

TI  - The effects of parental involvement in homework: two randomised controlled trials in financial education
T2  - EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper provides causal evidence on the effects of parental involvement on student outcomes in a financial education course based on two randomised controlled trials with a total of 2779 students from grade 8 and 9 in Flanders. Using an experimental design with three treatment groups, the impact of parental involvement in homework is distinguished from the standalone impact of the classroom intervention and homework itself. Intention-to-treat analysis reveals that access to the intervention effectively improves students' financial literacy in the two dimensions of knowledge and behaviour. The classroom intervention combined with a homework assigned to be completed with the parents increases financial literacy by 0.38 standard deviations. On average, the added value of prompting parental involvement in homework is not statistically significant. Yet, stimulating parental involvement has significant positive effects on behaviour for disadvantaged students.

TI  - Five steps to planning success: experimental evidence from US households
T2  - OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
AB  - While financial knowledge has been linked to improved financial behaviour, there is little consensus on the value of financial education, in part because rigorous evaluation of various programmes has yielded mixed results. However, given the heterogeneity of financial education programmes in the literature, focusing on 'generic' financial education can be inappropriate and even misleading. Lusardi (2009) and others argue that pedagogy and delivery matter significantly. In this paper, we design and field a low-cost, easily-replicable financial education programme called 'Five Steps', covering five basic financial planning concepts that relate to retirement. We conduct a field experiment to evaluate the overall impact of Five Steps on a probability sample of the American population. In different treatment arms, we quantify the relative impact of delivering the programme through video and narrative formats. Our results show that short videos and narratives (each takes about 3 minutes) have sizeable short-run effects on objective measures of respondent knowledge. Moreover, keeping informational content relatively constant, format has significant effects on other psychological levers of behavioural change: effects on self-efficacy are significantly higher when videos are used, which ultimately influences knowledge acquisition. Follow-up tests of respondents' knowledge approximately 8 months after the interventions suggest that between one-quarter and one-third of the knowledge gain and about one-fifth of the self-efficacy gain persist. Thus, this simple programme has effects both in the short run and medium run.

TI  - Effect of a Financial Education and Coaching Program for Low-Income, Single Mother Households on Child Health Outcomes
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - The financial difficulties of parents have a negative impact on the health of their children. This problem is more pronounced in single mother families. There is limited research on low-income, single mothers and how interventions to help them address financial difficulties may also benefit their children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a year-long financial education and coaching program on school absenteeism and health care utilization of children in employed, low-income, single mother households. This was a post hoc analysis of the Finances First study, a randomized controlled trial conducted in 2017-2020 examining the impact of a financial coaching and education program on economic stability and health outcomes in 345 low-income, single mothers. Either generalized estimating equations (GEEs) or generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to account for relationships between participants. For the continuous outcomes of child absenteeism, physician visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalization days, a linear mixed-effects model was used. The Finances First study demonstrated improvements in various financial strain measures. Compared to the control group, children of intervention group participants experienced 1 fewer day of school absence (p = 0.049) and 1 fewer physician visit (p = 0.032) per year, but no impact was seen on emergency room visits (p = 0.55) or hospitalizations (p = 0.92). Addressing social determinants of health in parents is necessary for improving child health outcomes.

TI  - Training services and repayment performance of micro-borrowers in Tunisia
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper aims to empirically assess the effectiveness of training services on borrowers' repayment performance in a leading microfinance institution in Tunisia. The two training services analysed are financial education and entrepreneurial coaching. Financial education as basic capital management training does not impact repayment performance. On the other hand, coaching programs to strengthen the technical, managerial, and marketing skills of microentrepreneurs significantly improve repayment performance. These results are obtained through an ordered probit model with endogenous treatment accounting for selection bias and endogeneity problems arising from unobservable factors that influence both the use of training services and repayment quality. These results remain significant after restructuring the sample into more homogeneous borrowers' groups and confirm the hypotheses of the human capital theory. The determinants of training services are also explored. The findings confirm the importance of integrated microfinance strategies, especially in remote rural areas. Combining microcredit with coaching will empower the poor to foster their entrepreneurial skills, productivity, and thus their repayment ability. This study sheds more light on how microfinance institutions can improve their programs in developing countries, which often suffer from a lack of technical and vocational training, the main handicap for transitioning young people to the labour market.

TI  - Analyzing the Effects of Financial Education on Financial Literacy and Financial Behaviour: A Randomized Field Experiment in Croatia
T2  - SOUTH EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - In this paper, we examined the financial attitude and financial behavior of students and determined their level of financial literacy through a survey. We found that female students report less interest in finance, have less confidence in their financial abilities, and have a lower financial literacy score than male students. On average, we can conclude that students have a low level of financial literacy. In this study we found factors that influence financial literacy which are age, student's GPA, whether they already took some form of personal finance course, a proxy for numeracy, and place of birth in terms of a capital city. Furthermore, based on controlled experimental field research, we conducted financial training, and investigated causal evidence of the effectiveness of financial education. A training intervention to increase financial literacy was effective and improved financial attitude but increasing financial literacy through means of education was insufficient for making better financial decisions since students did not report a lower frequency of impulsive buying or a higher hypothetical savings rate. We found no evidence that female students were affected by this training any differently than male students.

T2  - FINANZARCHIV
AB  - Using a multilevel analysis with data from PISA 2012, we find that the differences in financial literacy of 15-year-old students are explained by both individual and school characteristics. This paper finds that the financial education is positively related to students' financial literacy scores when it is taught as a cross-curricular subject and as part of business or economics courses, and to a lesser extent as part of mathematics and as an extracurricular activity. Also, math and reading abilities, and holding a bank account and a prepaid debit card, contribute positively to the development of financial literacy, while financial unfamiliarity contributes negatively.

TI  - SaveWise: The impact of a real-life financial education program for ninth grade students in the Netherlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - This experimental study with a pre-post and follow-up design evaluates the financial education program "SaveWise"for ninth grade students in the Netherlands (n = 713). SaveWise adopts a holistic approach, emphasizing action rather than mere cognition. Benefitting from explicit instruction embedded in real-life contexts, students in the program set a personal savings goal and are coached on how to achieve it. The short-term treatment results indicated that SaveWise expanded the students' level of financial knowledge; encouraged their intentions to save more, spend less and earn an income; and broadly improved their financial and savings behavior. The program demonstrated that it could serve as an effective and low-cost method to enhance the financial literacy of prevocational students, a financially vulnerable group. Although long-term effects were expressed only through financial socialization, this study offers evidence linking curricula to increased knowledge and improved behavior for a specific sample of students.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThis paper examines the relationships between bank switching and both customer vulnerability and consumer-oriented policies (financial education and disclosure practices).Design/methodology/approachThe analysis employs microdata from the Special Eurobarometer on Financial Products and Services, for 24 European nations. It carries out a probit estimation on the factors explaining propensity of bank switching, focusing on three characteristics associated with customer vulnerability: an advanced age, low educational attainment and residence in a rural or a relatively poor region.FindingsThe authors report that the probability of bank switching is significantly lower for three groups of vulnerable customers: the elderly, the less educated and those living in deprived regions. Further the authors identify that national financial education policies and disclosure practices have no significant effects on bank switching.Research limitations/implicationsBased on these results, the authors propose more targeted policies recognising customers' heterogeneity are required to increase bank switching behaviour.Originality/valueThis paper exploits a unique source of information on bank switching behaviour and customer characteristics across European nations. These data are complemented with information about consumer financial education policies and disclosure practices from the World Bank and geographical, market and regulatory factors at the regional and national levels. The paper contributes to two academic areas. First, it presents further evidence on heterogeneity of bank customer switching behaviour, addressed at improving the understanding of customer vulnerability in banking services. Second, it examines the efficacy of consumer-oriented policies (financial literacy and disclosure practices) in encouraging bank switching.

TI  - Construction and Push of Financial Instructional Resource Bank Based on Rough Set Theory
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB  - A perfect resource bank for financial education that can foster resource exchange and charitable work must be established. The traditional recommendation algorithm is improved in this paper based on the rough set theory, avoiding the issue where the traditional similarity calculation does not match the actual similarity judgement. When used in the field of resource clustering for financial education, the improved algorithm has the concept of an approximate set for boundary problems. It can more accurately describe the boundary groups of resource classification. When the model is offline, a rough K-means user clustering algorithm is used; users are assigned to the upper and lower approximations of K classes based on how similar they are to cluster centers, creating the initial neighbor set of users. Find the target user's nearest neighbor from the initial nearest neighbor set online, predict the item's score, and offer suggestions to it. The evaluation's findings indicate that this system can achieve a precision rate of 94.35 percent. Additionally, compared to the conventional method, the recommended recall rate is higher at 95.94 percent. This algorithm can effectively provide high-quality resources for financial teaching while overcoming the drawbacks of traditional recommendation algorithms, increasing recommendation accuracy.

TI  - The effects of ethnicity, gender and parental financial socialisation on financial knowledge among Gen Z: the case of Sarawak, Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial socialisation experiences, socio-economic factors, demographic characteristics and the financial knowledge of first year undergraduate students. Design/methodology/approach Using a questionnaire, data were collected from a sample of 450 first year university students from both private and public universities. A multivariate regression method was adopted to examine the influence of financial socialisation among respondents of different ethnic groups and their social backgrounds on the individual's financial knowledge. Findings The findings indicate that: firstly, financial knowledge is low among first-year university students in Sarawak. Secondly, male respondents outperform female counterparts in terms of financial knowledge. Thirdly, parental financial socialisation remains the main source of financial knowledge among the students. Fourthly, there are significant differences in financial knowledge across ethnic groups. Research limitations/implications It is paramount to implement financial education programmes to elevate the financial literacy for both youth and parents since parents remain the primary source of financial socialisation for young adults. Practical implications The study suggests that financial knowledge varies according to gender and ethnicity. Hence, financial education programmes should be designed to accommodate the differences between groups based on ethnicity and gender to achieve the best outcome. Originality/value This is the first study that draws a representative sample of university students in Sarawak that examines the effects of ethnicity, gender and parental financial socialisation on financial knowledge among first year university students.

TI  - Youth in individualistic countries have higher financial literacy: Evidence from PISA
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Financial literacy is an important life skill, but to date, it is mostly studied on the individual level. To investigate the role of national culture in financial literacy, we analyze data from 20 countries participating in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 financial literacy assessment with four approaches to measuring national culture: Hofstede, Schwartz, Inglehart-Welzel, and Minkov-Kaasa cultural dimension frameworks. This is the first study that links PISA financial literacy scores to these four culture models simultaneously, filling a gap in research on youth financial literacy. We find that culture explains an important part of within-country variance in financial literacy. The results indicate that individualism is positively associated with youth financial literacy scores, with the Schwartz embeddedness dimension remaining consistent after a set of control variables. Therefore, financial education initiatives need to consider in their design and implication the cultural context of the participants.

TI  - Gender Differences in Financial Knowledge among College Students: Evidence from a Recent Multi-institutional Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - Women's disadvantage in financial knowledge impedes their progress toward gender equality and produces negative consequences for both individuals and households. To better understand the gender gap in financial knowledge and shed light on possible intervention strategies, this study focused on gender differences in financial knowledge specifically among college students. Drawing on data from the most recent administration of the Study on Collegiate Financial Wellness (SCFW; N = 18,107) among current college students from 38 public four-year institutions, we investigated the gender financial knowledge gap and paid particular attention to the roles of family financial socialization, financial education, and financial behaviors. We identified a sizable gender gap in financial knowledge, even after controlling for other potential factors. OLS regression models and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analyses showed that financial education-indicated by majoring in Business and STEM fields and formal financial courses in high school-was most related to the gender gap in financial knowledge scores. Hands-on financial behaviors were positively associated with financial knowledge acquisition, particularly for female students. In addition, the family socialization process was largely not associated with students' financial knowledge scores or the gender knowledge gap. Based on these findings, we discussed potential intervention strategies for promoting financial knowledge and reducing the gender gap among and beyond college students.

TI  - Young people's perceptions of the responsibilities of organizations promoting financial capability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Today's changing market environment demands financial capability even from young consumers. This article concentrates on the perceptions of young people on the roles and responsibilities of school, public, private and non-profit sector actors in promoting financial capability among the young. The qualitative data were collected via focus group discussions among young people aged 15-26 in schools and education institutions across Finland. Educational institutions play an important role in the everyday lives of the young but tend to focus on macro-finance issues in financial education. Banks are seen as professional actors promoting financial capability to the young, but their activities are recognized as profit driven. Public sector and non-profit organizations are less familiar to young people as providers of financial information but are considered impartial and reliable. It is apparently difficult for young people to differentiate between the activities of the various parties offering financial advice. They would welcome finance-related information from several actors and from different perspectives. Financial education and financial matters are only interesting to the young when topical. In order to promote a financial capability among young people, the actors involved should become more proactive and cooperate with each other.

TI  - Financial Literacy Perception Scale for the Portuguese Population
T2  - SCIENTIFIC ANNALS OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This study aims to propose and validate a financial literacy perception scale for the Portuguese population. The utilized methodology was quantitative, based on a two-part questionnaire survey. The first part studies the sociodemographic profile and the second part evaluates the respondent's perception of financial literacy. The sample consisted of 830 Portuguese individuals, over 18 years old. The main results of this study demonstrate that the financial literacy perception scale presents a tri-factorial structure with satisfactory validity and reliability levels. The three obtained factors are 1-2 years financial planning and goals, long term savings and an affinity for numerical calculation. This study contributes to the increase of scientific knowledge in the field of financial literacy, to the assistance of financial education policymakers in the reformulation of their policies and to the creation of tools to help consumer financial behavior.

TI  - Family Communication, Privacy Orientation, & Financial Literacy: A Survey of U.S. College Students
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Increasing personal financial responsibility has increased the value of financial literacy in recent decades, leading to an emphasis on financial literacy and educational programs. However, these educational efforts have demonstrated mixed results, necessitating further research regarding the influences on personal financial knowledge and capabilities. The present study explores the effect of family socialization, specifically through an analysis of family communication patterns and privacy orientations, hypothesizing that open dialogue regarding financial matters will encourage transmission of knowledge and a willingness to seek information when needed. Reporting on the results of an online survey of college students, the results imply that individuals from more communicative families report stronger financial literacy. This finding suggests that financial literacy education programs might be more pedagogically useful if they incorporate and facilitate conversation around financial matters. The findings also reinforce the necessity of financial education.

TI  - Financial Illiteracy and Pension Contributions: A Field Experiment on Compound Interest in China
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - I conduct a field experiment to study the relationship between peoples' misunderstanding of compound interest and their pension contributions in rural China. I find that explaining the concept of compound interest to subjects increased pension contributions by roughly 40%. The treatment effect is larger for those who underestimate compound interest than for those who overestimate compound interest. Moreover, financial education enables households to partially correct their misunderstanding of compound interest. I structurally estimate the level of misunderstanding of compound interest and conduct a counterfactual welfare analysis: lifetime utility increases by about 10% if subjects' misunderstanding of compound interest is eliminated.

TI  - FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN THE CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL AREAS
T2  - MANAGEMENT THEORY AND STUDIES FOR RURAL BUSINESS AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Financial inclusion is a means to make full use of financial services, which stimulates the introduction of innovation, mobilization of savings and investment support, and thus contributes to the economic development of territories. The purpose of the study is to substantiate scientific and practical approaches to determining the role and place of financial inclusion in sustainable development of rural areas. The state of financial inclusion in rural areas has been assessed having applied the statistical-economic and calculation-constructive methods. The abstract-logical method made it possible to prove the positive impact of financial inclusion on the sustainable development of rural areas and to offer proposals for its further advancement. It has been argued that the key tasks of financial inclusion in the context of sustainable development of rural areas are financial education, access to financial services, and protection of the rights of consumers of financial services.

TI  - The Effect of Personal Finance Education on The Financial Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviour of University Students in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - There is much debate about the impact of personal finance education on financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, particularly based on studies in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (US). This paper makes a contribution to this debate, drawing on analysis of a survey of 521 undergraduate students at Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) in Indonesia in 2015. As part of that study, we measured the impact of a 14-week personal finance education course on financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. Our findings show that, when controlling for other factors, the personal finance course did, indeed, have a positive and statistically significant impact on financial knowledge. However, there was no statistically significant impact of the course on financial attitudes or behaviour. Our analysis also shows that family financial socialisation was an important driver of financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviour while other drivers of financial behaviour included income, work experience, year/field of study and discussing money with friends. We do not argue here that formal financial education is unimportant but that its role in changing attitudes and behaviour should be considered carefully if this is, indeed, its aim.

TI  - A comparative analysis of financial literacy levels and initiatives among students in five European countries
T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB  - Given the expected advantages for individuals and societies, financial literacy is high on the policy agenda in many countries. This paper reports the results from a unique survey conducted on a sample of 13-16-year-old students in five European countries, aimed at measuring and comparing their level of financial literacy skills. The results indicate significant differences in the level of financial literacy across countries that are interpreted in the light of the differences in the countries' educational policies and experiences with financial education. The findings suggest that supra-national coordinated action is needed to guarantee better financial knowledge and safeguard economic stability in future crises.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Economic Growth: How Eastern Europe is Doing?
T2  - ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL
AB  - In this study, we aim to analyse financial literacy as a driver of financial wellbeing and economic growth in three of the most recent EU Member States, namely Romania, Bulgaria, and Croatia. Our particular interest in studying more in-depth these three countries is generated by their difficult pathway in the transition to the Euro and economic convergence on one side and by the limited analysis carried out so far in relation to them on the other side. Various studies indicate that financial literacy is associated with wealth accumulation, and financial education can help achieve economic growth. To conduct the empirical analysis, in this study, we have used primary data provided by the OECD for our specific research purposes. The raw data were collected in a survey carried out in 2019 in seven South Eastern European countries reaching over 1,000 respondents for each country. We used two-stage least-squares regression to test our hypothesis and cluster analysis for comparisons among countries. Conclusions of our research reveal the main differences between countries in terms of financial literacy and reverse causality between financial literacy and economic growth for the analysed countries. Finally, the study gives some insights into the future design of public policies on financial education in these countries.

TI  - First-Year Impacts on Savings and Economic Well-Being from the Assets for Independence Program Randomized Evaluation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Individual development accounts (IDAs) help low-income families save by providing a savings account and a potential match toward personal savings for specific investments, such as a first home, business capitalization, or postsecondary education and training. The Assets for Independence (AFI) program uses AFI IDAs-commonly coupled with financial education-with the goal of helping low-income households achieve greater self-sufficiency. Using a randomized controlled trial, we evaluate the impact of AFI after one year and find that the median level of liquid assets was $657 higher for the treatment group than the control group (before matching funds). We also find that the treatment (vs control) group experienced less material hardship (by 34%) and was less likely to use nonbank check-cashing services (by 39%).

AB  - Representation on pension fund boards by state officialsoften determined by statute decades pastis negatively related to the performance of private equity investments made by the pension fund, despite state officials' relatively strong financial education and experience. Their underperformance appears to be partly driven by poor investment decisions consistent with political expediency, and is also positively related to political contributions from the finance industry. Boards dominated by elected rank-and-file plan participants also underperform, but to a smaller extent and due to these trustees' lesser financial experience.

AB  - The objective of this study is to determine the variables that explain the knowledge of financial literacy among college students in Tuxtepec, Oaxaca, and to identify whether the level of financial literacy that prevails in these students differs by gender, age and school grade. To do so, the study is based on a theoretical reference recently exposed by Goyal and Kumar (2021), who analyzed 502 articles between the years 2000 to 2019, in their findings they found that the gender gap and financial education, impacts on financial behavior. The participants of the study were 600 college students of a public sector Institution. The statistical procedure for data analysis was: first, the instrument was validated with Cronbach's alpha and normality through the values of skewness and kurtosis, then the correlation matrix, Brattle's test of Sphericity with Kaiser and the sample adequacy measure were calculated, and the extraction of components under the criterion of eigenvalues > to 1 and total variance. Finally, to verify if there is a difference in relation to the variables of financial education, gender, age and employment status, an ANOVA analysis is performed. Finally, the findings show that there is a difference between the variables: Gender and financial literacy (Saving and Investment); Age (Spending and Credit); Employment Status (Income, Money Management, Spending and Credit, Saving and Investment). This leads us to think that the higher level student presents a low level of financial knowledge, which could affect their personal growth, and that the gap of gender, age and employment status makes a difference in relation to the variables studied.

In the context of a weak financial knowledge in France, this article focuses on the particular situation of Generation Z (individuals born after 1995) and more particularly management students likely to be involved in financial decisions in the near future. Design/methodology/approach The analysis is based on a survey conducted in the Fall of 2019, through a questionnaire distributed to 300 students enrolled in a French business school. Findings The results indicate that financial knowledge is poor for students who do not follow a specialized course in finance. This research also demonstrates the importance of risk behavior, showing that risk adverse students are also those with the lowest level of financial literacy. Originality/value This article contributes to the academic literature by focusing on students in France. It is the first study to examine Gen Z financial literacy and its implications. It raises awareness on the importance of financial education in the education curriculum.

TI  - Supporting SMEs Financial Resilience during Crises: A Framework to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Financial Literacy Programs Targeting SMEs
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - Financing capital investments and working capital have been the key challenges for small businesses during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. Excessive indebtedness can increase the fragility of firms, particularly during times of uncertainty. While there are several programs globally that target entrepreneurs' financial literacy, most of them do not take into consideration entrepreneurs' financial resilience during and after crisis times such as pandemics. The objective of this paper is to discuss the status of financial literacy programs targeting entrepreneurs. This paper conducts a review of the relevant literature to establish the initial understanding and then generates a framework consisting of entrepreneurs' financial literacy along with its components. This is done by carrying out qualitative content analysis of the various financial literacy initiatives targeting entrepreneurs in twenty countries globally to understand their target segments, scope, initiating organisations and limitations. The paper then suggests a framework for entrepreneurs' financial education that takes into consideration financial resilience during and after crisis situations in general and pandemics in particular.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - This research uses data from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study to investigate the attributes of households that engage in higher levels of family financial planning. Greater levels of financial planning are evidenced when households report more positive responses in planning for retirement, saving for emergencies, and establishing a will. Based on an ordinal logistic regression, various demographic attributes, objective and subjective financial knowledge scores, frequency of participation in financial education, and the frequent use of financial websites or apps to help with financial tasks are positively related to higher levels of family financial planning. The results have implications for financial literacy education and the development and marketing of websites and apps for personal finance.

Distinctly, fixed-effects panel regression method is employed to examine the said nexus of nonfinancial firms listed at the Pakistan Stock Exchange. It is empirically unearthed that CEO attributes, namely, age, tenure, ownership, financial education, and career experience, are positively related to firm performance in general and capital investment decisions in particular. Second, capital investment decisions partially and significantly mediate the nexus between CEO attributes and firm performance with few exceptions that confirm the theoretical implications of upper echelons theory in an emerging economy context.

TI  - Debiasing the availability heuristic in student loan decision-making
T2  - EMPIRICA
AB  - The availability heuristic is a cognitive bias that affects various aspects of decision-making, including financial decisions. Based on a randomized controlled experiment, this study assesses the effectiveness of a debiasing treatment designed to prevent the effect of the availability heuristic in student loan decision-making. Experimental subjects were explained that there is a bias that may affect the decision of whether or not to pursue a master's degree and take out a graduate loan to finance it, and they were recommended to base their decision on reliable and verified sources of information as well as expert advice. This specific debiasing strategy is tested empirically. Specifically, this study shows positive causal effects of the debiasing intervention on two indices of student loan decision-making, which were constructed as summary indicators of student loan debt attitude, the perception that significant referents approve the student loan indebtedness, financial self-efficacy in student loan decision-making, and graduate loan borrowing intention. The article highlights the need for higher education institutions seeking to make financial education effective to be concerned with reporting on (and raising awareness of) psychological factors that are present in making financial decisions as well.

TI  - Game over or continue? How gamification can improve completion rate in adaptive learning
T2  - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Despite the potential for personalized learning, e-learning courses often suffer from low completion rates. In order to address this issue, we propose and empirically test a theoretical mechanism that examines how gamification can enhance the completion rate in adaptive learning courses by promoting a more positive behavioral response and attitude among students. To identify causal effects, we employ a quasi-experimental design with a time-discontinuity in treatment attribution. Our study involves a sample of 6592 adults who participated in a Belgian financial education platform. The effect sizes were estimated using non-parametric survival analysis. Our findings indicate that gamification led to a 5.7% increase in the number of questions answered and a 1.6 percentage point rise in the completion rate. These effects were particularly pronounced among younger individuals, single adults, and in relation to socioeconomic status questions used in the personalization survey. However, gamification did not significantly impact the completion rate for decision-making questions. By demonstrating that gamification serves as a causal mechanism for enhancing completion rates in adaptive learning courses, our study contributes to the underlying e-learning theory. Specifically, we highlight the role of psychological factors, such as improved behavior and attitude, which are particularly relevant during personalization surveys.

TI  - Can financial capability improve entrepreneurial performance? Evidence from rural China
T2  - ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB  - The capability of individuals to manage their finances is essential to the outcomes of their entrepreneurial activities. Using panel data from the China Household Finance Survey (C.H.F.S.) in 2013, 2015 and 2017, this article examines how financial capability affects entrepreneurial performance in rural China. The results demonstrate that financial capability is positively correlated with the scale, profitability and sustainability of entrepreneurship, which is robust in consideration of endogeneity. The effects of financial capability are heterogeneous for different entrepreneurs. Furthermore, technology, labour and land act as the mediating variables through which financial capability improves entrepreneurial performance. Therefore, to facilitate entrepreneurial success, it is important to provide entrepreneurs with financial education. Meanwhile, improvements to the financial environment should also be considered. Additionally, financial institutions should combine financial services with factors, such as technology, land and labour, to improve entrepreneurial performance.

TI  - Financial literacy of high school students in the Netherlands: knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION
AB  - We examined levels of financial literacy (knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and self-reported behavior) among 15-year-old high school students in the Netherlands (N= 2025), and investigated which factors are associated with the different financial literacy components. Our findings show lower levels of financial literacy among students in the lowest track in high school, students with low mathematical ability, immigrant students, students with low SES, students with mothers without a university degree, and students who do not discuss financial matters with family and peers. Notably, our findings show a large gap in financial knowledge levels between the lowest and highest high-school tracks in the Netherlands. These findings are useful for designing effective financial education and intervention programs, and for identifying groups that may benefit the most from financial education programs.

TI  - Impact of personality traits on financial planning: an empirical evidence from Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose This study examines the role of the big five personality traits: conscientiousness, openness, extroversion, neuroticism and agreeableness in financial planning. Design/methodology/approach The research design is a quantitative approach. The study has used structured questionnaires to collect data from 403 business students. The hypotheses were tested through structural equation modeling using AMOS. Findings The findings revealed that extroversion of personality traits have a significant negative influence on financial planning, neuroticism and conscious personalities have a significant positive effect on financial planning. However, two personality traits, namely openness and agreeableness, have no significant influence on financial planning. The study confirmed that out of five, three personality traits have significant impact on financial planning. Research limitations/implications The results suggest that all personality traits do not influence financial planning among students. Financial planning is deemed an essential decision in life. Although some people are very conscious about their future expenditures, others are not much concerned. Based on the findings, this study recommends that policymakers may conduct workshops and arrange seminars and conferences for the promotion of financial planning and individual's financial well-being. The government needs to promote financial education that can directly and indirectly enhance the saving planning capabilities of the people. Practical implications The results suggest that not all personality traits facilitate financial planning. Financial planning is deemed as a crucial decision in life. Some students are very conscious about their future expenditures, while others are not much concerned. This study recommends that policymakers conduct workshops and arrange seminars and conferences to promote financial planning and individuals' financial well-being. The government of Pakistan needs to promote financial education that can, directly and indirectly, enhance the savings and planning capabilities of the students. Originality/value This research contributes to the personality literature, the theory of planned behavior and the life cycle theory by testing the model based on empirical evidence. The current study is the first to focus on the role of the big five personality traits in financial planning among students in Pakistan, an emerging economy.

TI  - Impact of inflated perceptions of financial literacy on financial decision making
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - We examine whether inflated perceptions of financial literacy affect financial decision making. Gaps between objective financial literacy and self-reported (perceived) financial literacy (blind spots) predict 19 financial behaviors better than age, gender, income, ethnicity, marital status, self-employment status, and general education levels. Only two predictors, perceived financial literacy and financial education, carried similar levels of predictive power on financial behaviors. Those with inflated perceptions of financial literacy are more likely to miss mortgage payments, receive a collection call, use informal debt, and have poor banking behavior. Those without blind spots make better financial decisions. The differences between those with and without blind spots are more pronounced among individuals with higher education and income.

TI  - Individual capital and social entrepreneurship: Role of formal institutions
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Drawing on capital theory and institutional theory, we hypothesize the contingent role of a country's formal institutions (financial, educational, and political) on the relationship between individual capital (financial, human and social capital) and social entrepreneurship entry. Using the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data, we find that all three forms of individual capital are important for social entrepreneurship entry. Moreover, we find that this relationship is contingent on the formal institutional context such that (i) philanthropy-oriented financial systems have a positive moderating effect on investment of financial capital; (ii) educational systems have a positive moderating effect on investment of human capital; and (iii) political systems have a positive moderating effect on investment of both human and financial capital. We make substantial contributions to the literature on social entrepreneurship by ascertaining the nature of contingent effects of formal institutions on the relationship between individual capital and the emergence of social enterprises.

TI  - DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS AND THE CHALLENGE OF FINANCIAL ILLITERACY
T2  - CORNELL LAW REVIEW
AB  - Retirement investing in the United States has changed dramatically. The classic defined benefit (DB) plan has largely been replaced by the defined contribution (DC) plan. With the latter, individual employees' decisions about how much to save for retirement and how to invest those savings determine the benefits available upon retirement.
   We analyze data from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study to show that people whose only exposure to investment decisions is by virtue of their participation in an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan are poorly equipped to make sound investment decisions. Specifically, they suffer from higher levels of financial illiteracy than other investors. This lack of financial literacy is critical because of both the financial consequences of poor financial decisions and a legal structure that relies on participant choice to limit the fiduciary obligations of the employer with respect to the structure and options provided by the retirement plan.
   In response to this concern, we propose mandated employer-provided financial education to address limited employee financial literacy. We identify and discuss three requirements that a financial education program should incorporate-a self-assessment, minimum substantive components, and timing. Formalizing the employer role in evaluating and increasing financial literacy among plan participants is a key step in providing retirement plan participants with the resources necessary to manage important decisions regarding retirement planning and, ultimately, for enhancing the financial security of American workers.

T2  - FUTURE BUSINESS JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose The main purpose of this study was to find out the relationship between financial literacy and financial behavior and to discover the mediating influence of family financial socialization on this relationship. The study also particularizes that how personal knowledge of finance of an employee and whatever they have learned through family socialization will help them to make sound decisions having a financial impact on them and their family. Design/methodology/approach Employees of financial institutions employed and residing in Lahore, Pakistan, were the target population of this report. It was a cross-sectional quantitative research study. By using a detailed questionnaire, primary data were obtained. The sample size was 330; through convenience sampling, employees employed in banks were chosen. Descriptive analysis, parametric test, reliability test, and correlational examination with the aid of SPSS 23 and the use of SmartPLS 3.0. are knowledge investigation techniques used in this examination study to infer outcomes. Results/findings The outcomes which are created from this exploration include: (1) there was no distinction in the financial conduct of representatives from various socioeconomics gatherings. Financial education has a critical positive relationship with financial behavior. (2) Family financial socialization additionally shows a huge positive relationship with financial education and financial behavior. (3) Financial education demonstrated a remarkable abnormal impact on financial behavior through family financial socialization. (4) Family financial socialization shows partial mediation between financial literacy and financial behavior. We can accomplish that formal, as well as informal, training of finance decides the financial behavior of people. Originality/value This study is the first of this kind to examine the association between financial literacy, and financial behavior using family financial socialization as a mediator and employees of financial institutions as the target population.

TI  - KNOWLEDGE CHANGES FATE: CAN FINANCIAL LITERACY ADVANCE POVERTY REDUCTION IN RURAL HOUSEHOLDS?
T2  - SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Poverty reduction and inclusive growth in poor rural areas attracted the increasing attention of governments and scholars around the world. We investigate financial literacy by conceptualizing its impacts on rural households' poverty reduction, considering current and long-term economic income dynamics. Using a database from 2015 to 2017 China Household Finance Survey, we find that financial literacy has current and long-term effects on promoting rural households' status by eliminating and effectively improving poverty (dynamic effects). Second, this study reveals that financial literacy and education have a significant complementary effect on rural households' poverty reduction. The study distinguishes financial literacy from knowledge obtained through general education. Third, financial education is shown to significantly improve rural households' financial literacy on and enhance poverty reduction. The policy implications of our findings include that the governments and financial institutions are also required to rigorously measure, understand and improve financial literacy. Reform of financial regulatory systems must include a national strategy for education projects and improvement in the quality and supervision of financial products and services.

TI  - The Effects of Financial Literacy on Sustainable Entrepreneurship
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Entrepreneurship contributes to the economic well-being of every country. Specifically, the level of individual entrepreneurship is crucial in the process of developing and building economic potential, especially in Central European countries. Among the several factors impacting entrepreneurship, the ability to access the necessary external sources of financing need to be considered crucial. The financial literacy of the entrepreneur plays a crucial role in the relationship between the lender and the borrower. In this paper, we investigate the effects of financial literacy on sustainable entrepreneurship. We based our analysis on the framework proposed by the World Economic Forum. We present an OLS model that adopts entrepreneurship, financial literacy and macroeconomic variables. The analysis is carried out on individual and national data from different sources of information (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, World Bank, and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development). The results show a positive and statistically significant relationship between financial literacy and sustainable entrepreneurial activity. This evidence supports the increasing number of financial education initiatives and the inclusion of topics related to economic and financial culture in school education systems. We identify internationally valid policy implications. In the context of the growth strategies of Central European countries, financial literacy takes on even greater importance. The introduction of financial education in the national curricula could strengthen entrepreneurial skills and accelerate the inclusive growth process across Europe.

TI  - EMPLOYMENT TYPE, RESIDENTIAL STATUS AND CONSUMER FINANCIAL CAPABILITY: EVIDENCE FROM CHINA HOUSEHOLD FINANCE SURVEY
T2  - SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Research on consumer financial capability is important for consumer financial wellbeing and emerging in the literature. However, studies on consumer financial capability in the Chinese context remain limited. To fill up the research gap, we used data from the 2011 China Household Finance Survey to investigate whether employment type and residential status were associated with consumer financial capability in China. Consumer financial capability was measured by the range of financial assets. Results from OLS and Poisson regressions showed that people employed in the government-managed system, with urban residence registration and with non-local rural residence registration had a better financial capability than their respective counterparts. The results have policy implications for improving consumer financial education and supporting vulnerable consumers.

TI  - Consumer Financial Capability and Financial Satisfaction
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine associations between consumer financial capability and financial satisfaction. Consumer financial capability was measured by three sets of variables, perceived financial capability, financial literacy, and financial behavior. Using data from the 2009 US State-by-State Survey of Financial Capability, the results indicated the positive association between perceived financial capability and financial satisfaction. The findings suggested that desirable financial behavior increases while risky financial behavior decreases financial satisfaction. Subjective financial literacy was also found to contribute positively to financial satisfaction. The positive association between objective financial literacy and financial satisfaction was found in bivariate analyses but not in multivariate analyses. The results imply that to enhance consumer financial well-being, consumer financial education programs should emphasize action taking and encourage consumers to avoid risky financial behavior, engage in desirable financial behavior, and improve financial self-efficacy.

TI  - The medium is the message: Learning channels, financial literacy, and stock market participation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - This paper investigates the effects of learning channels on stock market participation. More specifically, we investigate the direct effects of learning about financial matters from one's private network, financial advisors, and the media, as well as the moderating effects of financial literacy on the relationship between learning from these channels and stock market participation. Analyzing a unique cross-section data that combine survey data and bank register data on individual retail investors, we find that media is the only learning channel that increases the likelihood of owning stocks and the portfolio share invested in stocks. We also find that financial literacy has a significant moderating effect: Interactions point to the joint importance of learning from media and financial literacy for individuals' stock market participation. Our findings suggest implications to policymakers when designing financial education programs.

TI  - Financial literacy, value creation and firm performance: an investigation of Italian small and medium enterprises
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP & SMALL BUSINESS
AB  - This article aims to determine the influence of entrepreneurs' financial literacy for the growth of SMEs' value. The paper verifies the hypothesis that there is a significant relationship between financial literacy and value creation, as indicated by economic value added (EVA (R)). The study analyses 162 Italian SMEs operating in the textile and clothing sector. The analysis period is between 2011 and 2013. Regression analysis and correlation analysis have been applied to test the hypotheses. The results suggest a positive and significant relationship between financial literacy and the variables that drive the value creation. Greater financial literacy allows SMEs to optimise their capital structure and select the most profitable projects. This work is useful to stimulate debate on the role of financial education in mitigating the difficulties of small and medium entrepreneurs in achieving value creation goals and in enabling policy makers to identify gaps and design appropriate responses.

T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - The purpose of this research is to analyze the influence of financial literacy and materialism on the savings decision of Indonesia's generation Z. This study was motivated by the country's agenda to achieve financial inclusion and develop human resources throughout the nation. We distributed questionnaires to 430 university students to measure their financial literacy score and materialism level, as well as the savings rate of every respondent. Through a series of regression analyses, we find that (i) age, gender, and major of study significantly influence financial literacy score; (ii) financial literacy positively influences savings decision; and (iii) materialism negatively influences savings decision. Our findings generally foretell favourable financial conditions for future generations of Indonesians. Finally, we also strongly recommend policymakers to start integrating financial education as a compulsory part of every school's curriculum, regardless of level.

TI  - How a training institute acquires learner satisfaction and loyalty under economic recession
T2  - TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS EXCELLENCE
AB  - For training institutes to be competitive in a customer-driven market, they must learn to satisfy their learners by knowing how to foster positive learning experiences. The present study proposes an adult learning model that views (1) motivation, (2) learning barriers and (3) perceived classroom climate as critical factors that (4) promote learner satisfaction and (5) stimulate learner loyalty towards a training institute. Sample data, collected from adult learners (n=629) who participated in finance courses offered in a financial education context, were analysed using structural equation modelling. Results show that motivation, barrier and classroom climate are critical elements for a positive learning experience. Specifically, classroom climate has a direct impact on both learner satisfaction and loyalty. In addition, motivation and barriers influence learner loyalty indirectly through perceived satisfaction, indicating that it is crucial for training institutes to attempt various methods to enhance or retain learners' satisfaction towards an institute in conjunction with fostering learning motivation, resolving learning conflicts, and maintaining a positive learning environment.

TI  - Does Banking Accessibility Matter in Assuring the Economic Growth in the Digitization Context? Evidence from Central and Eastern European Countries
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the nexus between financial (banking) accessibility and economic growth in the context of the digitization process. Thus, we built a panel model to evaluate the correlations between the banking accessibility and economic growth during 2010-2021 period for the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC). Furthermore, we applied the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) method with eight independent variables measuring the degree of banking accessibility and the dependent variable for economic growth. The results show that improving financial accessibility positively influences economic growth and greater access to banking services does not necessarily stimulate economic growth. In the digitization context, the results are relevant for the policymakers outlining that investing more in digitization is important, but this does not necessarily help people to have more access to banking services because there is also a lack of will and financial education that restrain them from embracing the digital changes.

TI  - Investigating the financial overconfidence of student-athletes
T2  - SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose There is a paucity of empirical research that explores the financial well-being of collegiate student-athletes. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the key aspects of financial well-being (e.g. financial knowledge, financial self-efficacy and finance-related stress levels) of varsity athletes at US colleges and universities. Design/methodology/approach The authors used data from the National Student Financial Wellness Study. The data were analyzed using general linear regression models. Findings The findings suggest student-athletes have lower financial knowledge than students who are non-athletes. Despite their lower levels of financial knowledge, these student-athletes report higher levels of financial self-efficacy. Furthermore, even when controlling for scholarship funding, student-athletes reported lower levels of financial stress than their counterparts. One could interpret this as student-athletes having a false sense of confidence in their money management behaviors. This overconfidence can impact many areas of their overall financial well-being. Alternatively, non-athletes may not be as financially confident as they should be. Research limitations/implications This study could be replicated with stronger measures (e.g. Financial Self-Efficacy Scale), with the inclusion of subjective financial knowledge measures, comparing the impact of demographic variables. As, most financial constructs have gender differences (Farrellet al., 2016) and race differences (Amatucci and Crawley, 2011) and depend upon college major (Fosnacht and Calderone, 2017). Another limitation of this study is the small percentage of student-athletes, a common problem with research in this area. Further research is also needed to unpack the finding that self-efficacy decreases at higher levels of financial knowledge. Practical implications It is evident that college students (athletes/non-athletes) need financial education. For universities and college coaches, this study could be used as a rationale for providing financial education for their athletes. The addition of financial courses could be used as a recruiting tool for collegiate coaches and benefit the university. Requiring financial education could also benefit universities long term as it may potentially increase the donor possibilities by alumni. As a final note, it is important that financial courses figure out ways to improve financial self-efficacy alongside financial knowledge, as findings suggest both are integral to decreasing financial stress. Social implications Less than 4 percent of universities in the USA require students to take a personal finance course (Bledsoeet al., 2016). If more universities included personal finance as a graduation requirement and did more to engage student-athletes (and non-athletes) in financial planning, then the average level of financial knowledge would likely improve on campuses across the USA. In addition, increasing young adults financial self-efficacy could improve financial stress which is linked to mental health and physical health. Originality/value This study provides the first empirical look into the financial well-being of collegiate student-athletes across the USA. Although there are many benefits to participation in college sports, student-athletes face additional time pressures and a predisposition to clustering around certain majors. Findings suggest that collegiate athletes need additional support around their financial literacy and non-athletes may need support developing financial self-efficacy.
   These two findings should be used by academic institutions and athletic departments to determine how to encourage financial health in their student-athletes and general student body.

TI  - PERCEIVED FINANCIAL WELL-BEING AS ANTECEDENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING: EVIDENCE FROM BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE MARKETING
AB  - Purpose: This study investigates how the relationship between perceived financial well-being and psychological well-being is influenced by income loss in the context of the adverse economic and social conditions resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.
   Method: A survey conducted with 959 Brazilian respondents allowed the research hypotheses to be tested by means of multigroup structural equation models.
   Originality / Relevance: Individuals who reported having experienced larger income losses also reported lower levels of financial and psychological well-being. Among the predictors of psychological well-being we tested, expected future financial security is the most important.
   Results: Our findings show that after controlling for gender, age, and income, current money management stress and expected future financial security (the present and future dimensions of perceived financial well-being, respectively), but not financial knowledge, are statistically significant to explain psychological well-being.
   Theoretical / Methodological contributions: The role of financial knowledge to predict financial well-being is weakened in the presence of the psychological variables investigated, which has important implications for financial education efforts. Banks and other financial institutions can create tools to enhance personal awareness and responsibility over one's financial future.
   Social / Managerial contributions: Managerial and societal implications include the provision of knowledge that may allow financial education programmes, economic empowerment interventions, and public policies aimed at reducing the negative impact of the perceived financial strain on well-being to be better targeted.

TI  - Effect of household's financial literacy on pension decision making: evidence from China's new rural pension program
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose China's New Rural Pension Program (NRPP) has been implemented for a decade, but the factors that facilitate rural residents' participation have received little attention. This study aims to investigate whether financial literacy has an influence on rural residents' behavior of participation in the NRPP. In particular, this study further verifies if high financial literacy is important and whether financial education can enhance the impact of financial literacy on current, long-term and dynamic pension decisions of rural households. Design/methodology/approach This study investigates the impact of financial literacy on rural residents' participation in China's NRPP using the China Household Financial Survey (CHFS) Data of 2015 and 2017. This study constructs an analytical framework for current, long-term and dynamic impacts and comprehensively analyzes the value of financial literacy in the decision making of the NRPP. This study uses the instrumental variable method to solve the possible endogeneity problem. In addition, the authors also demonstrate the positive role of high financial literacy in household pension decisions. Further analysis reveals gender and regional heterogeneity in the impact of financial literacy on pension decisions. The moderating effect model explores whether financial education has a significant moderating effect on financial literacy and pension decision making of the NRPP. Findings Financial literacy can improve the participation behavior of households in rural areas (dynamic effect) and promote their current and long-term participation in the NRPP, choosing a higher pension contribution level in the NRPP. However, financial literacy has no significant effect on the change in the contribution amount of the NRPP. Further research finds that high financial literacy has comparative advantages in household pension decision making in rural areas. There are gender and regional differences in the impact of financial literacy on pension decisions. In addition, effective financial literacy education enhances the current, long-term and dynamic impacts of residents' financial literacy on NRPP participation and pension contributions. Practical implications This study comprehensively considers the impact of financial literacy on pension decision making behavior from three aspects: current, long-term and dynamic, making up for the dearth in the existing literature that only focuses on the impact of financial literacy on current financial behaviors and bridging the gap between the theoretical framework and experimental results. Our study proposes new policy implications: (1) Governments and financial institutions should pay attention to financial literacy and education levels in rural areas and carry out financial education and training programs to increase social welfare levels by increasing rural residents' participation and pension contribution. (2) The community can strengthen the policy advocacy of the NRPP and make people develop a stronger sense of trust toward it. The government can also subsidize individual accounts through financial support.

TI  - Learning by doing: the role of financial experience in financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - In this paper, we examine the impact of financial experience on financial literacy. Exploiting a unique feature of New Zealand, whereby domestic students can obtain interest-free student loans and can fully participate in the national retirement scheme while international students cannot, we employ an instrumental variables approach to identify the causal effect of financial experience on financial literacy. We conduct surveys on a sample of 338 business students and find that there is a positive and causal effect of financial experience on financial literacy. Our results have important implications for financial education programmes and may explain why many of these programmes to date have had limited success.

TI  - Understanding sources of financial well-being in Romania: A prerequisite for transformative financial services
T2  - JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which financial behavior and financial well-being are affected by cognitive and non-cognitive factors in a specific Romanian post-communist context. This study shows that financial well-being is significantly linked to both financial education and to a set of non-cognitive factors. This paper offers strategic insights on what financial services should communicate to consumers and how they should be communicated, achieve the mutual benefits of the transformative paradigm.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study uses an online sample of 1,602 participants, representative of the general population in Romania concerning income and education, to collect data on financial anxiety, financial security and financial saving behavior (dependent variables), self-control, optimism, future orientation, deliberative thinking and financial literacy (independent variables). This paper measures the latent constructs - as composite indices, using partial least squares - path modeling. Working with WarpPLS software version 6.0 allows exploration of both linear and non-linear relationships involved in the model, along with their practical and managerial implications.
   Findings
   The results indicate that the key component to address in the development of financial services (in the post-soviet context) is financial anxiety. This study finds that, in contrast to Western countries, in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE), financial education is not always a panacea. Additionally, financial security is not always the most important goal for consumers.
   Practical implications
   This paper suggests managerial recommendations for redefining the relationship between banks and the Romanian population, focused mainly on diminishing financial anxiety and increasing financial security, as key elements of transformative financial services.
   Originality/value
   The study highlights the significant role played by behavioral variables in shaping financial well-being in Romania, being among the very few investigations illustrating the relevance of the topic in post-communist countries. This research shows unique challenges for the design of transformative financial services in a specific (post-communist) setting and provides insights on how financial services marketing can become more effective in the CESEE region.

TI  - Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour to Explore Predictors of Financial Behaviour Among Working Adults in Malaysia
T2  - FIIB BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - The current study sought to explore the predictors of financial behaviour among working adults based on the theory of planned behaviour. This study employed the correlational cross-sectional questionnaire-based research design. In total, 558 samples were obtained through a purposive sampling technique. The measurement model and proposed research model were evaluated using partial least squares structure equation modelling. The findings revealed that financial knowledge is positively associated with the attitudes towards retirement, perceived behavioural control, subjective norms, and financial behaviour of working adults. In addition, the findings demonstrated that retirement attitude, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms each had a positive relationship with behavioural intention towards planning for retirement. Furthermore, the results showed that behavioural intention and perceived behavioural control are positively associated with the financial behaviour of working adults. The findings could aid financial educators and advisors in delivering the correct blend of financial knowledge to assist working adults in making better financial decisions and practising proper financial behaviour.

TI  - Developing financial competence about mortgage loans by informal learning using banks' online calculators
T2  - EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AB  - Background and aim: Financial literacy (or financial competence) has become an internationally relevant and highly regarded topic. Since people often lack sufficient financial competence, in many countries efforts have been made to foster formal financial education. Less attention, however, has been paid to whether informal learning using information available on the Internet can also support the development of financial competence. However, this seems to be an important question because the Internet has expanded the opportunities for informal learning. In addition, people need to acquire financial competence on their own because not every financial topic relevant in one's lifetime is covered in formal education syllabi. Against this background, in this study we tested whether people are able to develop financial competence by learning informally using information available on the Internet. We focused on mortgage loans, as they are comparatively complex financial products. Mortgage loans have the potential to significantly influence an individual's financial situation. In addition, society might carry the burdens of risky and uninformed decisions about mortgage loans-as the financial and real estate crisis has shown.
   Method: 45 students of economics and business studies in their final undergraduate year participated. They were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental group explored information about mortgage loans using the loan calculator of a German bank. The control group did not explore webpages. Before the intervention, students from both groups completed knowledge tests and self-assessed their financial knowledge and behaviour. After the intervention, students had to work on a case and to decide whether a small family should take out a mortgage loan for financing a house. The decision had to be justified. In addition, students were administered an immediate and delayed knowledge test.
   Results and conclusions: Students of both groups did not differ in knowledge acquisition, decision making about taking a mortgage loan and argumentation quality. However, prior knowledge can be referred to in order to explain the results. Therefore, informal learning using the Internet did not seem to be effective if people did not have sufficient prior knowledge. This result underlines, on the one hand, the necessity of financial education-be it prior to informal learning or in the course of informal learning. On the other hand, the results can be interpreted as a hint to consider how to improve informal learning activities, e.g. by supporting self-regulation or by improving information material.

TI  - Money Attitude and Spiritual Well-Being
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study seeks to explore the relationship between money attitude and spiritual well-being amongst Chinese youths in Hong Kong. Cross-sectional data (N = 501) were obtained from 249 Chinese university students in 2021 and 252 Chinese university students in 2022, aged between 19-23 years old. The participants were instructed to answer the Spiritual Well-being Questionnaire (SWBQ) to measure their spiritual well-being in the personal-communal, environmental and transcendental domains. The respondents were then asked to complete the Money Attitude Scale (MAS) to assess their attitudes and beliefs regarding money in three dimensions: power-prestige, anxiety and distrust. Results show that a negative correlation exists between the three dimensions of money attitude and the three domains of spiritual well-being. In addition, the power-prestige dimension of money attitude was the most accurate predictor of spiritual well-being. A stepwise regression analysis unveiled that the power-prestige dimension of students' money attitudes explained 6.2%, 15.4% and 27.6% of the variance in their sense of spiritual well-being across the personal-communal, environmental and transcendental domains, respectively. Adopting healthy perspectives and attitudes towards money are vital for the development of the youths' (spiritual) well-being. Thus, financial education and knowledge are crucial for adolescents.

TI  - Unequally Indebted: Debt by Education, Race, and Ethnicity and the, Accumulation of Inequality in Emerging Adulthood
T2  - EMERGING ADULTHOOD
AB  - Emerging adults in the U.S. face significant economic uncertainty during the early life course. Economic uncertainties grew in the 2000s, especially for the Millennial cohort. Access to credit can be a resource to manage the instability that characterizes emerging adulthood. However, debt can also become a burden, making credit like a "double-edged sword." We study inequality in debt holding for five debt types that provide distinct resources and burdens, including mortgages, car loans, student loans, credit cards, and other debts to businesses. We analyze the extent to which the Millennial cohort accumulated unequal debts by the end of emerging adulthood using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 Cohort. We find strikingly unequal debt holding by education, race/ethnicity, and education-by-race/ethnicity for Millennial emerging adults. We conclude that policies and programs that support emerging adult financial wellbeing will be crucial for healthy development and reduced inequalities during this life course stage.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY IN ROMANIA: A TEST OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS STUDENTS
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Romania is in a rather dishonorable position from the financial literacy perspective in the European Union, ranking last among countries. To increase the level of financial education of the Romanian population, public and private institutions, organizations, and companies have recently taken the initiative in this field, mostly after 2015. Our contribution builds on these recent developments and aims at testing the level of basic financial literacy of Romanian university students, enrolled in business and economics studies, using the OECD Financial literacy test. Data was collected through an online survey on a voluntary basis, and the responses were analyzed using statistical indicators. Results indicate a rather high level of financial literacy among students, but also significant differences among respondents that may be explained by several demographic characteristics and specific attributes. The most important characteristics that influence the degree of financial literacy of students are age, students' cycle of studies, the way the students live, property ownership and students' involvement in financial market transactions and contracts. We stress towards the need to act through concrete measures to improve young people financial literacy, as a necessary condition to navigate in an increasingly complex environment, where finance plays an essential role.

TI  - Financial Literacy on High School Students. How is Their Performance if Study and Work?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The aim of the study is to analyze the financial knowledge of high school students in Mexico; its relationship with the student's age, gender, and condition of studying and working. The study is a non-experimental quantitative, descriptive, exploratory, and correlational cross-sectional study. Through a non-probabilistic sampling by self-determination, the total participants were 423 students enrolled in three institutions of Higher Education, all belonging to the state of Oaxaca. For the application of the instrument, we had the support of some teachers to share a link to Google forms. In order to determine the relationship between financial literacy (FL) and other sociodemographic variables (gender, age, and employment status), a dichotomous Probit model is used. The results show low financial literacy of the students, who only a fifth understand the concepts of compound interest, inflation, and diversification; no gender difference was identified in this age group. The significant effect of the interaction variable (gender and condition of studying and working) on the probability of understanding the effect of inflation on purchasing power is evident. Therefore, the results obtained can contribute to the design of financial education (FE) programs for young people at an early age that allows them to make informed financial decisions in any aspect of their personal and work life.

TI  - Orthopaedic Surgery Resident Financial Literacy: An Assessment of Knowledge in Debt, Investment, and Retirement Savings
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
CP  - Meeting of the American-Orthopaedic-Association
AB  - Most orthopedic residents carry significant debt and may enter their practice with little knowledge of business management, minimal retirement savings, and overall poor financial literacy. This study aimed to gauge financial literacy, debt, and retirement planning in United States orthopedic surgery residents. Willingness to participate in formalized financial education was also assessed. Eighty-five allopathic orthopedic surgery residents in the United States completed a 14-question anonymous online survey in 2016. The survey assessed demographic data, self-assessed financial knowledge, amount of credit card debt and loans, preparation for retirement, and willingness to participate in formal didactic education on these topics. Most respondents derive their financial knowledge from personal research (51%), whereas only 4 per cent have a formal curriculum. Despite most respondents reporting more than $200,000 in outstanding loans, only 31 per cent create and stick to a budget. Few programs offer retirement advice, and 48 per cent of respondents save $0 toward retirement. Eighty-five per cent of residents expressed interest in learning about personal investment, savings, and retirement planning. Orthopedic surgery residents carry significant debt and do not achieve their high-income potential until disproportionately later in life. Only 4 per cent of residents have formal training in investing, personal finance, or retirement despite a majority who desire such a curriculum. In fact, almost 75 per cent of those surveyed felt less prepared for retirement than their peers outside of medical training. This study suggests a role for formal financial education in the orthopedic curriculum to prepare residents for retirement, improve financial literacy, and enhance debt management.

TI  - Talking money at home: the value of family financial socialization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The objective of this study was to empirically examine how family financial socialization affects individuals' financial outcomes, including financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being, based on the family financial socialization theory (FFST). Design/methodology/approach Using a national representative sample of 6,311 US respondents from the 2016 National Financial Well-Being Survey, structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test the hypotheses in this study. Sampling weights were incorporated into the structural model using the maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors and a Satorra-Bentler scaled test statistic (MLM estimation). Findings This study concludes the effectiveness of family financial socialization by showing that parental financial socialization has significant positive impacts on financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being. In addition, parents' education can significantly influence the quality of parental financial socialization. Practical implications The result underscores the importance of financial socialization in the family context and encourages parents to discuss financial matters with their children at home. Detailed implications have been provided to financial educators, practitioners and policymakers to incorporate parental involvement in the design of financial education programs, as well as financial services providers to improve marketing strategies for their banking services. Originality/value This research is amongst the first to empirically explore the relationships among parental financial socialization, financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being based on the FFST. The study also contributes to the literature by confirming the effects of parental socialization received in childhood on adults' later financial outcomes.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY AND FINANCIAL RISK TOLERANCE OF LOTTERY GAMBLERS IN THAILAND
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - This paper investigates the impacts of financial literacy level, financial risk tolerance and demographic characteristics on gambling behavior of informal laborers. The data were analyzed by Multivariate Analysis of Variance and Multinomial Logistic Regression. The total of 995 participants used in this research were collected by Multi-Stage Randomization from the informal laborers in Southern Thailand. The empirical analysis revealed that the financial literacy confidence, the risk tolerance, and the demographic characteristics were significant determinants of the gambler's behavior. The older the gamblers were, the more they got addicted to gambling. Also, the more the people perceived that they have a high level of financial literacy, the more they would gamble. However, it was found that the female laborers were more frequent gamblers than the males. Thus, agencies responsible for supervising the financial education should be aware of the expected outcomes, not only focusing on actual financial literacy, but also supporting the individuals to achieve a healthy level of financial literacy confidence.

TI  - Don't Let Them Fool You: Adolescents' Present-orientation and Inferior Financial Understanding
T2  - YOUNG
AB  - In the last 20 years, adolescents have gradually become very important clients for the banking industry. The current study investigates, using data collected in a survey, whether adolescents offered two options for investing in a saving certificate choose the financially preferable one and whether this choice is related to their time preference, after controlling for gender and bank account ownership. The participants were 270 adolescents from public high schools in Israel. The findings indicate that approximately 40 per cent made the inferior financial decision. However, those with a bank account were less likely to decide poorly, possibly indicating that having an account reduces financial illiteracy. Moreover, selecting the financially inferior choice correlates with a higher subjective discount rate (higher present-orientation). A gender effect is also found; girls have higher subjective discount rates, and this effect is stronger for girls with a bank account. Policy implications regarding financial education programmes are discussed.

TI  - Unraveling the impact of financial literacy on investment decisions in an emerging market
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We examined the impact of financial literacy on investment decisions, taking a sample of 384 investors from India. A multi-dimensional construct to measure financial literacy was developed basis the theory of planned behavior. Investment decisions were measured by taking six proxies on a five-point Likert-type scale. The causal link between financial literacy and investment decisions was examined using simple linear and binary logistic regression. The results exhibited moderate to high levels of financial literacy among investors. Results further confirm that investors' investment decisions are positively influenced by their financial literacy levels. It is concluded that financial literates have a greater likelihood of making informed investment decisions. These outcomes have practical implications for policymakers, managers, employers, and investors, especially in an emerging market context, making a case for relevant financial education programs to empower investors. The study adds to the theory of financial literacy developing a multi-dimensional construct and introducing Macroeconomic Factors as a proxy for investment decisions.

TI  - From finance to management: Rui Ennes Ulrich, a Portuguese scholar of the early twentieth century
T2  - BUSINESS HISTORY
AB  - Finance is usually considered to be a complex science, made up of unsatisfactory explanations interpreting the mystery and volatility of financial markets. Expectations, the mood of the market, as well as investment strategies to manage diversified portfolios, are intimidating issues for most people even today. This paper describes how early twentieth-century globalisation framed a network of stock exchanges, from local to regional and national scale, stimulating scientific knowledge on equities, shares, securities, bonds, debentures, transactions, and risk premiums. Both individuals and institutional investors needed financial education. In Portugal Ruy Ennes Ullrich wrote his doctoral dissertation on stock exchanges and financial markets. His book was published in Coimbra in 1906, by the University Press. This paper analyses his contributions in the context of the available literature, and his management performance.

TI  - Improving financial wellbeing in Indonesia: the role of social media as a mediating factor in financial behavior
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - This research examines the impact of an external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, an internal locus of control, and social media on financial well-being, focusing on the mediating role of financial behavior. Financial wellbeing can be improved by reducing the external locus of control, increasing individual financial self-efficacy and financial literacy, and using social media appropriately. Furthermore, the importance of financial behavior is emphasized by the indirect effects of external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, and social media on financial wellbeing. The study features an online survey questionnaire with 438 respondents. The relationships were investigated using PLS-SEM. According to the study's findings, financial influencers are social media data variables that significantly affect financial behavior. These findings can assist policymakers, and business leaders in understanding the most influential factors affecting Indonesia's financial wellbeing. Furthermore, the Indonesian government encourages the younger generation to improve its literacy index through public financial education. Research into financial wellbeing is critical because it aligns with the government's goal of improving the stability and health of the population's finances. Individuals can maintain financial control, allowing them to meet financial goals, manage unexpected expenses during emergencies, deal with financial problems, and enjoy life.

TI  - Responsible access to credit for sole-traders and micro-organizations under unstable market conditions with psychometrics
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - In a context of market volatility, the growing complexity of financial products, and a shift towards self-employment, there is an increasing demand for inclusive financial services for sole traders and micro-organizations. To address this need, we conducted a study using real-time data from a Fintech lender in the Czech Republic to assess the effectiveness of a new financial literacy based psychometric credit scoring model (PSM) in improving access to finance for micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSME) sector, particularly sole traders, and micro-organizations, during volatile market conditions. This study affirms that PSMs play a significant role in responsibly including this underserved sector. Specifically, we observed a 30% higher approval rate and a 23% lower default rate when utilizing the PSM versus the traditional credit scoring model (TCSM). Moreover, during the period of substantial market volatility and instability, such as the state-of-emergency during the COVID-19 pandemic, the PSM exhibited a 13% higher approval rate at a 20% lower default rate than the TCSM. This evidence supports the proposition that PSMs offer a viable option for promoting financial inclusion and targeted financial education among MSMEs in the face of instable financial markets.

TI  - On Financial Bubbles and Earthworms: Lessons from Hungary's Rural Pyramid during its Economic Transition
T2  - EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRYSIDE
AB  - In the early 1990s, Former Eastern Bloc countries, including Hungary, experienced a broad transition from centrally-planned economies, managed by party-state bureaucracies, to privatised economies. Throughout the market liberalisation process, the Hungarian market embraced entrepreneurship as a mechanism for generating both private wealth and economic growth, despite a lack of experience and know-how in business management and financial education, made largely unavailable by the communist regime for more than 40 years. On these grounds, several Eastern European countries experienced the rise of Ponzi schemes. The Hungarian earthworm pyramid can serve as an interesting example of the financial pyramids that evolved during the transition of economies. However, some of the characteristics of the Hungarian earthworm pyramid suggest that it was a rather unique case when compared to other Eastern European pyramids during the economic transition period of post-communist nations. Our study concludes that, under different political and economic circumstances, the Hungarian bio-humus production by earthworms could potentially become a profitable venture, rather than a source for financial and societal damages.

TI  - Helping Those That Hide: Anticipated Stigmatization Drives Concealment and a Destructive Cycle of Debt
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB  - Debt accumulation has been linked to materialism, impulsivity, shortsightedness, self-control, and lifestyle preferences. However, applying stigma theory allows novel insights into debt accumulation for middle-class individuals who access a variety of credit-related products. The authors define anticipated stigmatization of debt as the negative judgment and discrimination an individual expects to experience because of their consumer indebtedness. Results from a series of studies demonstrate that although financial stress motivates behaviors designed to reduce debt, debtors who anticipate stigmatization perform a variety of concealment behaviors (secrecy, social spending, and help avoidance) that hinder debt reduction and have negative effects on well-being. To understand how to help these individuals, the authors collaborated with a financial education company, designing a field experiment to examine the efficacy of a behavior change course. Individuals who anticipated stigmatization and formed new social connections in a community-based condition reduced their consumer debt. Although the emotional effect of community-based support has been examined in other stigma contexts, this study is the first to investigate the effect on well-being in a debt context and link social benefits to actual behavior change in terms of debt reduction behaviors and debt repayment.

TI  - Impact of school management on legally adequate content of a budget plan: The evidence from Slovenia
T2  - ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB  - Management of a primary school in Slovenia is binded to preparing content of budget plan by law and by legal requirements of a local community. Budget plan is a result of financial planning. By Slovenian law management of a primary school is responsible for preparing for budget plan. Management of a primary school in Slovenia is actually a headmaster, usually elected by teachers and thus having no preliminary financial education. The only employee in school, assisting management in budget plan preparation, is an accountant. In our study, we tested if attitude of management to planning together with communication between management and accountant, impacts legally adequate content of schools' budget plans. This was tested on a sample of public primary schools in Slovenia with the t-test for independent samples and the principal components analysis. We found that only communication between the management and accountant impacts legally adequate content of these plans. These findings suggest more financial trainings for schools' management and increased role of local communities, as well as state's institutions, in controlling if plans are law-compliant. Since schools are major consumers of public money, inadequate schools' plans impact negatively local community's and state's budgets.

TI  - Determinants of individual savings among Tanzanians
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose Savings help to provide for future personal and households needs. The purpose of this paper examined Tanzanians' determinants of saving. It studied the relationship between individual characteristics (gender, marital status, age, education level and financial education) and saving behaviour. Design/methodology/approach The paper used 2017 national baseline survey data with 8,959 observations from all over Tanzania. Descriptive analysis and econometric models were used to test the developed hypotheses. Findings Descriptive results show that Tanzanians mainly associate saving with setting money aside to keep it safe for future use. The results also show that most Tanzanians keep their money at home - a very informal way of saving. The results indicate that age and education level are key characteristics that determine positive saving by Tanzanians.
   Originality/value This study contributes to the life-cycle theory by showing how families, societies and exposures influence individuals to save. Gender and marital status seem to play a lesser role than social- and exposure-related aspects of age and education. Exposure and social interactions are key determinants in the attitude to saving.

TI  - Financial Distress and Psychological Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Objective: We examine the impact of financial distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and psychological well-being.
   Methods: We analyze cross-sectional survey data (n = 2,545) from the Life during Pandemic study in Chile. We estimate linear probability models to analyze the relationship between economic fragility, financial distress, and psychological well-being.
   Results: Our findings show unemployment and income loss are highly predictive of experiencing a range of financial problems, such as a lack of savings, as well as difficulties paying bills, consumer debt, and mortgage loans. In turn, financial distress leads to a higher prevalence of poor well-being and mental health deterioration, and sleep problems.
   Conclusion: Expansion of mental health assistance services are needed, as new diagnosis of mental health conditions has increased, but treatment has not, pointing to a barrier in the access to some mental health care services during the pandemic. Policies designed with the objective of improving financial education are necessary to increase precautionary savings and financial resilience, and alleviate the psychological burden of debt in the future.

TI  - Challenging Factors Affecting Access to Finance by Female Micro Entrepreneurs in Anambra State, Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN BUSINESS
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine challenging factors in accessing finance by female microentrepreneurs in Anambra state, Nigeria. This study employed both qualitative and quantitative methods in data collection. Multi-stage sampling technique was adopted in selecting the sample, and the data analyzed using logit regression model based on the binary choice that describes the probability of women micro entrepreneur's choice between two mutually exclusive alternatives (accessing or not accessing micro-credit). The study identifies fear of default, lack of collaterals, inability to get guarantors and information asymmetry as main factors challenging women's access to finance. The study recommends, among others, the need for financial education for female micro entrepreneurs.

TI  - Differences between NZ and US individual investor sentiment: more noise or more information?
T2  - NEW ZEALAND ECONOMIC PAPERS
AB  - In this study, we introduce a newly created sentiment index of individual investors in NZ constructed similar to the well-known sentiment index provided by the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) in the U.S. This unique setup allows us to compare different aspects of investors' behaviour in both countries. We show that NZ market participants are less confident about the directional movement of the stock market, their expectations are more volatile and their distributions have fatter tails. By contrast, both bullish and bearish sentiment is more persistent among U.S. investors. Furthermore, our analysis of return predictability reveals that both groups of investors behave as noise traders. However, the results for NZ investors are stronger. Overall, our findings call for better financial education, particularly in the area of equity investing.

TI  - Mind the Gap in Financial Inclusion! Microcredit Institutions fieldwork in Peru
T2  - REVISTA DE CONTABILIDAD-SPANISH ACCOUNTING REVIEW
AB  - Financial inclusion remains a key political issue. Since microcredit first captured public attention, Microfin-ance Institutions (MFIs) have expanded rapidly all around the world. Although much economic and fin-ancial literature has highlighted the importance of microfinance as a factor of development, there is also an intense debate about its effectiveness as a development tool. This paper is a descriptive analysis of the microcredit state of the art contrasted with the fieldwork done in Peru. A qualitative research methodo-logy was used; 29 in-depth face-to-face interviews were done with different microfinance agents: MFIs, NPOs, microfinance associations, and microfinance customers in Peru. Peru has been chosen because it has a dynamic and well-regulated microfinance sector with more than 70 entities specialized in microfin-ance. Though statistical generalization is not possible, interview data provided rich and contextual evidence, which is often missing from a quantitative research approach. This paper highlights the importance of fin-ancial and accounting education in microcredit beneficiaries and how can it be enhanced in the digital age. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced vulnerable population to embrace new digital technologies and has highlighted the digital gap that still exists in Latin America although this situation presents opportunities and challenges. This present study contributes to the debate over how to improve microcredit interventions ' impact on the more vulnerable and identifies some unique insights into the interrelationships of financial education and financial inclusion. The results of the present study confirm that financial and accounting education are key elements in financial inclusion. (c) 2023 ASEPUC. Published by EDITUM -Universidad de Murcia.

TI  - Irrational or Rational? Time to Rethink Our Understanding of Financially Responsible Behavior
T2  - ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Models of finance rationality expect individuals to actively prepare for retirement by consistently investing and building a diversified asset portfolio, with any behavior deviating from these expectations being identified as irresponsible. This framework of (ir)rationality and (ir)responsibility ignores the role of constraints in shaping financial behavior. Extending economic geographic insights on everyday financial practices as complex processes of meaning-making, we reveal how varied approaches to retirement savings are shaped by the experience of constraints inherent in a capitalist welfare state. Using the accounts of forty-two interviewed women and people with a minority ethnic background in the UK, we show how the interplay between everyday rationalities and structural constraints construct variegated financial subjectivities and practices that reflect the context that individuals face. Our findings contribute to the theorization of variegated financial subjects and disrupt the application of corrective policy measures, such as financial education, which put more pressure on individuals rather than tackling the inequalities inherent in the capitalist welfare state broadly and in the pension system specifically.

TI  - Understanding the functional form of the relationship between childhood cognitive ability and adult financial well-being
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The increasing complexity of the modern financial landscape presents significant challenges for individuals' financial well-being. In this study, we aim to investigate the relationship between cognitive ability and financial well-being by utilizing data from the British Cohort Study, which follows a sample of 13,000 individuals from birth in 1970 to the present day. Our objective is to examine the functional form of this relationship while controlling for factors such as childhood socio-economic status and adult income. Previous research has established a correlation between cognitive ability and financial well-being, but has implicitly assumed a linear relationship. Our analyses indicate that the majority of the relationships between cognitive ability and financial variables are monotonic. However, we also observe non-monotonic relationships, particularly for credit usage, suggesting a curvilinear relationship where both lower and higher levels of cognitive ability are associated with lower levels of debt. These findings have important implications for understanding the role of cognitive ability in financial well-being and for financial education and policy, as the complexity of the modern financial landscape poses significant challenges for individuals' financial well-being. As financial complexity is increasing and cognitive ability is a key predictor of knowledge acquisition, misspecifying the true relationship between cognitive ability and financial outcomes leads to an undervaluation of the role of cognitive ability for financial well-being.

TI  - Radiology trainee retirement programs: Options and participation
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Financial security and retirement planning are essential for all medical professionals including radiology residents. Given the available discretionary income during residency it is crucial to have insights into investment. We aimed to assess the prevalence of retirement plans offered to radiology residents, the available choices, and their degree of participation. Methods: Two surveys were created using Qualtrics platform, one targeting program directors and another one oriented to radiology residents with items focused on demographic, financial status, offered plans, and participation. Analysis was performed using chi square whenever appropriate using Qualtrics platform. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: 199 radiology residents (72.6% attending university -based programs) responded to the survey. 83.7% participated in retirement plans; university -based programs had the highest rate of offering plans; 82.8% vs 70% and 53.8% for university, community and hybrid programs respectively. The most frequently offered retirement plan was a 403(b). Most of the residents (94.3%) started investment in the retirement program as early as PGY1 and PGY2. A considerable proportion of programs lacked formal training on retirement plans; however, residents emphasized the significance of financial education during their residency. Conclusion: Radiology residents are more likely to participate in a retirement plan if it is offered by their program. Providing proper guidance by incorporating financial education into radiology residency curricula can optimize residents' decision making and economical planning, leading to a more secure financial future.

TI  - The environmental influence of national savings in D-8 countries: Empirical evidence using an ARDL model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Extensive theoretical and empirical evidence supports the crucial role of savings in driving a nation's economic growth and development. However, previous studies have not considered their potential environmental implications. This study aims to explore the influence of savings and remittances on the Developing-8 countries (D-8) from 1989 to 2019, using the panel autoregressive distributed (ARDL) model. The findings reveal that national savings and remittances, in the long run, help mitigate environmental degradation in the D-8 countries but energy use and population growth stimulate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In contrast, economic growth does not significantly affect these countries' environmental quality in the long run. However, none of the explanatory variables have any significant relationship with CO2 emissions in the short run. Therefore, policymakers in the D-8 countries are strongly encouraged to prioritize the enhancement of national savings across the three economic agents to maximize the positive effects of savings on environmental quality. Government savings can be increased by reducing deficits and borrowings, while corporate savings can be encouraged by implementing investment tax credits and promoting research and development. Additionally, governments can embark on public enlightenment campaigns on financial education and provide incentives to encourage household savings.

TI  - Subjective financial knowledge, prudent behaviour and income The predictors of financial well-being in Estonia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study how subjective and objective knowledge of finance, behaviour in managing personal finances and socio-economic status affect financial well-being.
   Design/methodology/approach - The financial well-being score is constructed in quantitative financial literacy survey data from Estonia as the arithmetic mean of four statements on a five-point scale. Four hypotheses are tested in multiple regression analysis.
   Findings - Subjective knowledge has a stronger relation with financial well-being than objective knowledge. Financial behaviour score and income level correlate with financial well-being.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper contributes to literature on financial literacy, subjective financial knowledge and financial well-being. In future research, psychological factors and future orientated financial well-being should be included, and their relationship to subjective well-being could be analysed further.
   Practical implications - The results highlight the importance of subjective knowledge and sound behaviour for improving financial well-being. Providers of financial services should address these more in the design of their services and communication.
   Social implications - Policymakers developing national strategies for financial education need to address subjective financial knowledge for increasing financial well-being in society.
   Originality/value - Knowledge, behaviour and subjective knowledge have not been used simultaneously in the analysis of financial well-being in Europe before.

TI  - Financial inclusion drivers, motivations, and barriers: Evidence from Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Financial inclusion is a cornerstone for economic growth. However, the area is not well explored in the developing world. Therefore, this paper is motivated to examine the drivers, barriers and motivations associated with financial inclusion in Ethiopia. We used formal accounts, formal savings, and formal credits as financial inclusion indicators and applied a probit regression model using data from the World Bank's 2017 Findex database. The result of the study showed that the determinants, barriers, saving and credit motivations are different across individual characteristics. Involuntary exclusion (such as distance to financial services and lack of documentation) and voluntary exclusion (lack of funds, a family member has an account,) are significant barriers to formal account ownership. The study also found that the motives for using financial accounts for saving and lending differ among people with different sociodemographic characteristics. To promote financial inclusion, the author suggests that the concerned body take actions toward social inclusion (the poor, women and the youngst) and improve financial education . To enhance further adoption and expansion of financial technologies such as mobile banking and mobile money, there should be mechanisms to ensure the accessibility and usage of financial services.

AB  - We evaluate whether a scalable online teacher professional development (OTPD) module that requires little time investment enhances students' financial literacy. Two randomised controlled trials were performed, with 1827 students, 53 teachers and 47 schools participating. The financial education programme on its own increased students' financial knowledge, but did not improve financial behaviour. Regarding the OTPD effects, we observed that students' knowledge scores did not significantly improve, but that behaviour scores were enhanced relative to students whose teachers did not receive access to the OTPD module. In comparison with students in the control condition, behaviour scores improved with 0.39 SD.

TI  - Determinents of Financial Behaviour of Individual Investors: In Context with Financial Literacy, Overconfidence and Herding
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Purpose: Financial decisions largely depend upon Financial Literacy and psychological biases of an individual investor. Drawing upon the behavioural finance theory, this paper articulates the association of Financial Literacy, overconfidence and herding bias of individual investors with their financial behaviour.
   Methodology: The survey method was employed to collect data from 171 salaried individuals, who are living in Delhi, India and investing through Angle Broking Co. (Securities co.). Online structured questionnaires were circulated by using a purposive sampling method to collect the responses. To examine the strength of the relationship between variables, partial correlation and hierarchical regression tests were applied using SPSS software.
   Findings: The findings revealed that only investor's Financial Literacy have a strong positive association with their financial behavior whereas overconfidence and herding bias have negative impact.
   Practical Implications: The findings of this study may serve as a guide to policymakers and the management of financial institutions in developing investment policies as per the financial behavior of individuals.
   Originality/Value: This article in useful for the policy makers, insurance companies and Government agencies should focus on conducting financial education programs for the purpose of increasing financial awareness among individuals.

TI  - Tunisian corporate bond market liquidity: a qualitative approach
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to explore the failures of Tunisian secondary corporate bond market liquidity to understand the determinants of corporate bond market liquidity at large. Design/methodology/approachWe adopted a qualitative approach to studying the Tunisian Stock Exchange. Dealers' perceptions were collected through semi-structured face-to-face interviews; the data was recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. FindingsSecondary corporate bond market failures are due, in part, to microstructural choices - especially the use of an over-the-counter market as a trading venue. The absence of a corporate bond yield curve, a narrow investor base, market participants' lack of financial education and authorities' attitudes are equally responsible. Research limitations/implicationsThis study is useful to researchers, policymakers and practitioners, as it identifies microstructural and other factors affecting the Tunisian secondary corporate bond market. We interviewed only Tunisian dealers while ignoring other categories of market participants. Furthermore, a focus group discussion could have improved our understanding of the determinants of the Tunisian secondary corporate bond market. Originality/valueThis paper aimed to qualitatively discuss several issues related to the Tunisian secondary corporate bond market. To date, little academic research has addressed this topic in the illiquid and non-transparent corporate bond markets.

TI  - How consumer confidence affects price conscious behavior: The roles of financial vulnerability and locus of control
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Despite their ubiquity in academic and commercial research, evidence of the usefulness of consumer confidence indices is mixed. To contribute to this debate, we examine the psychological mechanisms through which consumer confidence does (and does not) affect consumer behavior. We develop a conceptual model, which we test via structural equation modelling and moderated mediation analysis, using data from a sample of US consumers (n = 1,090). Rather than conceptualize consumer confidence as a single construct, our study is the first to distinguish between national consumer confidence and personal consumer confidence. Consistent with cognitive appraisal theory, personal consumer confidence mediates the relationship between national consumer confidence and perceived financial vulnerability, which in turn leads to increased price conscious behavior. Drawing on attribution theory, we find that external locus of control enhances the effects of national consumer confidence. We provide practical advice to economic forecasters, business analysts, marketers, and financial educators.

TI  - RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND APPROACHES FOR COVID-19 BY INDIAN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
T2  - INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTION
AB  - The novel and ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic in India has had a phenomenal effect on India's financial, educational system and community development. It effects the overall education system in India but the Indian educational institutions have made substantial contributions and taking proper steps to minimize the effects of this virus. Its only made possible by the contributions have been made primarily by medical and emergency management, counselling for mental health, control on people's movement and innovation in Emergency remote teaching (ERT). In what manner to tackle these risks and emergency problems, this paper reviewed and presented all the situations, highlighted the risk management process and plan of Indian educational institutions from university to school level institutions and proposes some approaches for the solutions of community dissemination.

TI  - Drivers of financial inclusion in Ghana: Evidence from microentrepreneurs in the Wa Municipality of the Upper West Region
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Globally Financial inclusion provides an opportunity to promote equal access to resources for all. One of the crucial catalysts for microenterprises development is access to the financial market. However, the growth of many microenterprises has been truncated in Ghana due to limited access to financial opportunities. Despite this challenge, little is known about the drivers of financial inclusion in Wa Municipality of the Upper West Region of Ghana. This paper examines the drivers of financial inclusion of microentrepreneurs in the Wa Municipality of the Upper West Region of Ghana. Using a close ended questionnaire, this study employed an exploratory survey design to collect data from 200 engaged in trading, manufacturing, and services. The respondents were sampled using a simple random sampling technique. Given that the outcome variable is binary, the study used a binary probit regression model for the data analysis. The results predicted that religion, awareness of loan services, business registration, and preparation of financial statements drive financial inclusion in Wa Municipality. From the results, the study recommends that financial service providers should consider social networks, entrepreneurial practice, gender and religion as sensitive drivers of financial inclusion. In addition, financial education should be intensified as knowledge of the available financial products is a key driver of financial inclusion in the Municipality. While this study has contributed to the body of literature on financial inclusion in Ghana, further research is necessary to identify consumer financial needs to meet clients' expectations.

TI  - Learning by P2P bidding
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING & ECONOMICS
AB  - Most of peer-to-peer (P2P) online borrowers are small business managers. Learning behavior of them is under-analyzed in the literature of P2P online lending. Using a large sample from one of the China's largest online P2P lending marketplaces- renrendai.com, we examine whether a borrower in the P2P lending market has a learning behavior when he/she bids interest rates for a loan. We validate the existence of learning behavior in the interest rate bidding, in which they learn from the previous experience and adjust the interest rates downward, so that they can obtain finance at a lower cost. Further analysis shows the heterogeneity across gender and education. We find that female borrowers and highly educated borrowers are more effective in the learning process. Robustness check further supports our hypothesis. Our findings point to the importance of providing financial education for groups of low education level. Managerial implications are discussed.

TI  - The Purposes and Motivations of Savings Accumulation based on Generational Affiliation, Financial Education and Financial Literacy
T2  - ACTA POLYTECHNICA HUNGARICA
AB  - In today's fast-paced world, we have had to learn that uncertainty is constant, and that we have to face it in unexpected situations. It is not only our income that is affected by uncertainty in the future, but also our jobs and our livelihoods, which, in many cases, depend on other factors. Global conflict situations only add to this sense of insecurity. In uncertain situations, the fundamental goal of individuals and organisations is to seek security through the means at their disposal. This is no different for our finances. Savings are a key element in the lives of individuals, households and businesses in managing such uncertainties. Savings have always been crucial at the level of the national economy as well, as they have been the source of investment according to classical economics. Nations with a high savings rate have always been able to invest more and have thus enjoyed greater economic growth. Savings, by their role as a store of wealth, help to deal with sudden and unexpected situations. Today, however, savings no longer have only a security function, but must be seen as a collateral for future consumption, a source of future consumption needs, a guarantee of maintaining the standard of living to which we have become accustomed. The current paper sets out to observe and examine the rationale behind savings accumulation from the point of view of households in the light of the pandemic. It is also an objective to identify the impact of the pandemic on the security function of savings formation, providing a picture of the motivations of different generations to save and make savings for the future, based on the results of a questionnaire survey conducted in Hungary.

TI  - A proposition to implement inclusive Islamic financial planning in Indonesia through bibliometric analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose In Indonesia, the Islamic Economics and Finance Sector is growing rapidly, but the literature on Islamic financial literacy is still minimal. This study aims to show research opportunities with the theme of Islamic financial literacy, especially inclusive Islamic financial planning through bibliometric analysis of Scopus and connected papers. Design/methodology/approach A comma separated value (CSV) file containing more than 2,000 references meta data was used for analysis on Vos Viewer in the period of 1963-2020. The grouping of network visualization maps is done using six keywords, namely, "Financial Literacy," "Financial Inclusion," "Islamic Financial Literacy," "Financial Planning," "Personal Finance" and "Household Finance." Findings The findings complement the keywords that are generally used as references in the formation of theories regarding inclusive Islamic financial planning. After combining the "ris" file from the connected paper, the most used terms are financial knowledge, financial education, financial behavior, financial decision-making process, financial inclusion, risk sharing and financial discourse. Originality/value The proportion which planned to be applied in Indonesia will differentiate the inclusive Islamic financial planning framework from what has been done before. This study outlines the basis of the relevant literature review in the theme of Islamic financial literacy research, especially inclusive Islamic financial planning.

TI  - The drivers of adult financial literacy: Exploring the role of attitudes towards finance
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB  - This study investigates the factors driving the financial literacy of adult population in Spain using a regression count model (specifically the latent class Poisson model). The paper pays special attention to the effect of certain financial attitudes and financial personality traits (such as financial myopia, risk aversion, attitude to financial planning and self-perception of financial vulnerability) upon financial literacy. The results demonstrate a positive association between the financial skills, the sociodemographic characteristics and the attitudes and personality traits of individuals regarding finances. Furthermore, the analysis permits the conclusion that the effects of the financial attitudes analysed in the study vary among the different population groups, which suggests the need to adapt financial literacy promotional programs to the characteristics of the target group. Findings have implications for financial educators, practitioners and policymakers to help them recognize the proper financial program to be delivered on the basis of the FL levels and the sociodemographic composition of the individuals.

TI  - The importance of staying positive: The impact of emotions on attitude to risk
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS
AB  - In this article, we examine the impact of emotions towards financial investments and emotions towards life in general on attitudes to financial risk using questionnaire data from 970 UK-based retail investors. We show that risk tolerance monotonically increases with positive emotions towards investments and life, and decreases with negative emotions. We incorporate a broader range of relevant emotions than in comparable existing studies, and we show, perhaps surprisingly, that positive emotions have a more substantial impact on risk tolerance than negative emotions. We find that emotions towards investments have a considerably greater explanatory power for the cross-section of risk aversion than gender, age, income, investment experience and investment knowledge. Our research sheds light on the different impacts that integral and background emotions have on retail investor financial decision-making. We suggest several implications for regulators and financial advisors, and we emphasize the importance for financial educators to support investors in developing emotional resilience.

TI  - A Comprehensive Approach to Measuring Financial Vulnerability and Literacy: Unveiling Connections
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - In the aftermath of the 2007-08 financial crisis, the worsening financial conditions of households increased concerns about their financial vulnerability (FV). In this context, policymakers embraced the notion of financial knowledge to foster sound financial behaviors among individuals and households, aiming to mitigate the detrimental effects of FV on households' financial wellbeing and the overall economy. However, the relationship between FV and financial literacy remains inconclusive. This lack of definitive findings may stem from limitations in measuring FV and narrow focus on specific dimensions of financial literacy. This paper analyzes the relationship between financial literacy and FV by creating a comprehensive measure of (the level of) FV and considering different dimensions of financial literacy. Using a sample of 8,554 individuals in Spain obtained from the 2016-17 Survey of Financial Competences, we construct a continuous measure of FV by using Nonlinear Principal Components Analysis (NLPCA). Then, we employ OLS and ordered probit regressions to examine the potential association between different dimensions of financial literacy and FV. The findings indicate that the level of FV is negatively related to self-perceived financial knowledge, while no statistically significant relationship is found regarding objective financial knowledge. Evidence also reveals that "highly financially included" individuals are more likely to exhibit financial resilience. These findings highlight the need for the development of financial education initiatives that are action-oriented.

TI  - Does board diversity mitigate risk? The effect of homophily and social ties on risk-taking in financial institutions
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Research Question/Issue: This study investigates whether greater board diversity and looser social network ties have an impact on board independence and risk -taking in US financial institutions from 2010 to 2022.The econometric strategy involved structural equation models, where risk as a dependent variable was measured by two latent variables and a total of five measures of risk. Several aspects of board diversity were utilized including gender, social, experience and educational backgrounds. Research Findings/Insights: The findings suggested that diversity in nationality had a significant positive effect, while age and gender diversity had a minor effect on mitigating risk. Two measures of educational diversity had mixed results while suggesting that financial education is associated with greater risk. Also, social networks had a significant effect on risk -taking, especially on market risk. Theoretical/Academic Implications: The study highlights the importance of maintaining a sensible level of board diversity across all aspects to avoid issues of cohesion and poor communication. This implication arises from the conclusion that too diverse a board might suffer from the lack of cohesion and communication, while a board with very low diversity will not be able to benefit from diverse backgrounds and expertise. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Results from this study recommend incorporating social networking requirements in defining the independence of directors.

TI  - Financial literacy in Hungarian libraries: Survey-based steps for implementation
T2  - JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB  - In Hungarian libraries, the development of financial literacy (FL) is either not present at all or is very low in intensity. The Hungarian government strategy does not involve libraries in FL development. Based on the dissemination of information and digital literacy, there are numerous good examples worldwide proving that libraries, reaching all of their users, can effectively take part in financial education and, built thereon, business development and business information services. This can increase their social recognition and even supplement their funding. In 2022, for the first time in the country, the authors conducted a survey among Hungarian librarians to assess the current situation, to identify what hinders the expansion of services related to FL, and what tasks should be performed and what innovations should be introduced in libraries. The survey also seeks to define which fields of competence are to be acquired by librarians. It also reveals the forms of external professional cooperation that are necessary to organise library programmes strengthening financial awareness. The results provide valuable information not only for Hungary, but also internationally, since they showcase the challenges that the library system of a former socialist country in Europe faces after three decades of market economy in this current, market- and profit-oriented world.

TI  - Credit record overconfidence and alternative financial service use
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of credit record overconfidence on the use of alternative financial services (AFSs). Design/methodology/approach Using data from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), the authors estimate logistic regressions on the use of at least one AFS by adding a credit record confidence variable that captures deviations between self-assessments of credit record management and the number of reported behaviors that would negatively affect aspects of a Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Findings The authors find that respondents with credit record overconfidence have over two times higher odds (123.9%) of using AFS than the odds of respondents with financial knowledge overconfidence (46.8%), relative to their reference categories. When compared directly, those with only credit record overconfidence have 32.6% higher odds of using AFS than those with only financial knowledge overconfidence. Practical implications The results provide implications for education programs, not only for vulnerable groups at higher risk for AFS use but also for those with cognitive biases, such as credit record overconfidence. Potential solutions include personal financial education that includes debiasing and behavioral techniques for overconfidence. Originality/value This paper studies, for the first time, the effect of deviations between actual and perceived credit record management on AFS use.

TI  - Basic debt literacy and debt behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - Using unique survey data from 1001 individuals representative of the French population, we document that less than half of the sample (47%) can provide correct answers to two basic questions addressing the functioning of debt interests. This proportion is higher among credit users, but the improvement emerges mainly from mortgagors (55%) and much less from consumer credit users (51%). Furthermore, among consumer credit users, the portion of respondents giving at least one erroneous answer (i.e. neither correct nor "don't know") is above one third and significantly higher than in the rest of the population (35% vs. 30%). Next, with regressions, controlling for a wide array of socio-demographic variables and potential confounding factors like present-biased preferences or saving-oriented literacy, we show that incorrect answers to debt literacy questions predict a greater propensity to use consumer debt and to use it in a more expensive way (i.e. choosing lower settlements). Lastly, we find that respondents who answer debt literacy questions incorrectly are not more likely to report intention to take financial education training or to seek financial advice from a bank advisor, even when such respondents also present a high propensity to use debt or to use it in an expensive way.

TI  - Research on the Path of Financial Quotient Education in China's Application-oriented Undergraduate Colleges and Universities
T2  - EDUCATIONAL SCIENCES-THEORY & PRACTICE
AB  - Compared with the developed countries such as Britain and America, China's financial and business education started later without enough attention, especially in the economically backward central and western regions. With the further deepening of China's reform and opening-up and economic development, the backward finance and business education and the unbalanced regional development are not in line with China's economic and social development. Therefore, strengthening the financial and business education and further developing the human capital are the urgent tasks of China's education reform and development, and the universal financial education has been raised to the national strategic level. With the application-oriented colleges and universities in the central region as the object of research, this paper uses the method of questionnaire to explore ways to improve the financial literacy of college students.

TI  - Does audit committee characteristics a driver in risk disclosure?
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Risk disclosure is one of the practices of corporate governance. Disclosure of risk is an important aspect of a company's financial reporting since it provides information on how various risks can occur, the company's response to these risks, and the impact these risks have on the company's future. By sharing risk information, the corporation has attempted to be more transparent in delivering information to its stakeholders. Based on risk disclosure information, stakeholders are anticipated to make better judgments. This study aimed to examine the influence of audit committee characteristics on risk disclosure. This analysis includes 202 bank statements from 2017 to 2021, the observation period for banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Regression was used for data extracted from annual reports, corporate governance reports, and company websites. The results demonstrated that the audit committee's expertise positively impacted risk disclosure. Risk disclosure is unaffected by the size and frequency of the audit committee. The audit committee plays a crucial role in providing information regarding risks; therefore, the corporation must pay close attention to the audit committee's quality. The knowledge of audit committees with a background in accounting or financial education can promote risk disclosure.

TI  - Money Worries: Examining Demographic Difference in Financial Anxiety
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - We identify key demographic groups that suffer the most from financial anxiety. Identifying demographic groups that suffer the most from financial anxiety will aid in finding policy avenues to improve financial outcomes. With data from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study and Ordinary Least Square regressions, we find that females and those individuals with some college are the most financially anxious. In addition, the separated or divorced worry more than the married, those with children worry more than the childless, and White non-Hispanics worry more than other racial/ethnic groups. Analyses of gender subsamples show that black non-Hispanic males worry more than White non-Hispanic males, while the result of the female subsample is the opposite. The findings of this study have major policy implications, and more research is needed to determine how to best measure financial anxiety and solutions to reduce financial anxiety. Financial counseling and planning professionals can target groups that are most financially anxious. We recommend that financial education include a curriculum to educate and prepare individuals for financial anxiety and its implication on financial outcomes.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - In light of previous literature that has investigated the effects of MiFID and MiFID II regulation on stock market liquidity, we investigate whether the introduction of MiFID II in Romania has had any effect on the stock market liquidity. Through our empirical analysis, we were able to estimate a meaningful reduction of liquidity in the Romanian stock market liquidity, in response to MiFID II, in line with the previous empirical literature. We find that the liquidity of the BET index constituents has decreased in the period following MiFID II. We find contradictory results in what concerns the German stock market, which could be explained by the different level of development of the stock markets and of the financial education of investors.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY: THE IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF THE SMEs IN KUCHING
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - This study aims at investigating the financial knowledge, financial behaviour and the attitude towards finance amongst on small medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) in Kuching. More specifically on how these powerful factors affect the profitability on fast growing business enterprises in largest city in the Borneo Island over the last decade. The research takes a descriptive approach fitting its underlying pursue and draws interesting conclusions with over 75% response rate. Analysis of the data collected clearly reveals that the knowledge of finance in general relates significantly stronger to the bottom line of these business entities relative to the owners' financial attitude and their ensuing behaviour towards financial decision making. Therefore, small medium entrepreneurs are highly recommended to participate in financial education on a regular basis to keep them well informed and equipped with the latest ways of managing the finances of their businesses to ensure better financial planning, execution and monitoring of enterprises that inevitably will lead to increased and sustainable earnings.

AB  - The literature on the relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being is growing but yet to consider whether the social support emanating from cultural settings conditions this relationship. The main objective of this article was to assess the role cultural values (Protestantism and Catholicism) played in explaining the financial well-being of small- and medium-scale enterprise (SME) owners in a developing economy, Ghana. On the basis of 300 randomly selected SME owners, an ordinary least squares technique was employed to establish this relationship. The results highlight that the level of financial literacy of SME owners tends to influence their financial well-being. In addition, Protestant ideology weakens financial wealth acquisition process of SME-Owners. Lastly, the study found little support for the assertion that culture moderates the relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being. Consequently, the study recommended that policies aimed at promoting financial education for financial well-being should not neglect the cultural context of beneficiaries.

TI  - Reaching Sustainable Financial Health: Gender Differences in Risk-Taking Patterns of Financially Excluded People
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Providing sufficient financial accessibility to low-income individuals is considered a way to decrease income inequality and could be a key factor in sustainable economic growth. To make the financial accessibility policy more effective, analyses of individuals' understanding of financial risk within low-income groups need to be conducted. The current authors investigated individuals' attitudes towards loan financial risk in terms of gender difference. Using South Korean survey data, we examined the relationship between gender and attitude towards loan financial risk with a regression analysis. We found that within a low-income group, males were more willing to pay higher interest rates than females. In addition, males' willingness to pay high interest rates became stronger when their current financial costs were high. The results indicate that males are less careful with the risks that high interest rates can bring. Thus, the results imply that interventions, such as more substantial financial education, are required for males to make financial accessibility polices more effective.

TI  - Are business students more financially literate? Evidence of differences in financial literacy amongst Portuguese college students
T2  - YOUNG CONSUMERS
AB  - Purpose Considering the importance of financial literacy (FL) in people's lives the goal of this study aims to assess the level of FL of young Portuguese students, addressing the impact of the level of education on the FL of college students. Design/methodology/approach Data from a non-probabilistic sample of 185 students attending higher education bachelor's and master's degrees courses in Economics, Management and Marketing was collected between February 25 and March 23, 2019, using an online questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed using IBM SPSS 25 to analyze the data. Findings The findings show that the level of the degree (bachelor's or master's degree) and the academic background of the individual's parents have a positive impact on FL. Moreover, among individuals with a high level of FL, gender and professional situation are additional predictors. Furthermore, the authors observed that the level of FL of Portuguese students attending higher education is overall low, especially in terms of their knowledge of the main financial concepts, which may call for public policies to be implemented so that to reduce this vulnerability. Research limitations/implications Among limitations is the limited sample collected, restricted to a particular target, Portuguese students attending business-related courses such as Economics, Management and Marketing, either studying for a master's or bachelor's degree. This issue restricts the generalization of the overall findings to other students studying different fields. Future studies can collect a random and representative sample. Practical implications This study test can be replicated to generate a diagnosis in any region or country, identifying how financially literate the region under analysis is. Also, this can be done to verify the evolution of FL after educational interventions. Social implications FL is an important competence. In fact, youngsters in the whole world have been suffering from a lack of financial knowledge (FK), and some characteristics of them can push them into indebtedness, and, even bankruptcy, such as a higher level of status consumption, the tendency to have an attitude of self-appraisal, to be self-centered, to seek instant gratification. This study helps to lead to a better understanding of this phenomenon. Originality/value Addressing college students attending different levels is an add-on to the existing body of literature. This paper contributes to study differences in FL between college and master students, enlightening and evaluating the role of scholarship maturity on financial education. Furthermore, some of the findings challenge the extant knowledge regarding the influence of professional experience, gender and age on the level of FK that students have. Finally, the current approach is innovative as it addresses FK, FL and numeracy in the same study.

TI  - The formative role of contextual hardships in women's career calling
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOCATIONAL BEHAVIOR
AB  - The current study explores the relationship between contextual hardships and women's career calling. We examine how the formation of career calling drive is linked to how an individual perceives and affectively reacts to forms of oppression within and across institutional subsystems. In conceptualizing career calling formation, we attempt to broaden our understanding of this concept to include external and negative contextual factors. Our core argument holds that the perception and experience of contextual hardships play a key role in the formation of career calling. Based on 20 in-depth qualitative interviews with successful women in Lebanon whose work fits the scholarly definition of career calling, our findings show that these women's career narratives are constructed in close relation to perceptions of oppression (i.e., violence, marginalization, powerlessness, exploitation and cultural imperialism) experienced across the political, financial, education and labor, and culture subsystems. Taken together, our main findings demonstrate that experiences of negative and external contextual hardship elicit affective responses that foster a career calling drive. Our findings help bridge the neoclassical and modern approaches to career calling by showing the important role that external sources can play in driving the internal formation of career calling.

TI  - Designing for Inclusivity: Platforms of Protest and Participation
T2  - URBAN PLANNING
AB  - This article offers critical insights into new digital forms of citizen-led journalism. Many communities across western society are frequently excluded from participating in newsgathering and information dissemination that is directly relevant to them due to financial, educational and geographic constraints. News production is a risky business that requires professional levels of skill and considerable finances to sustain. Hence, 'hyper-localised news' are often absent from local and national debates. Local news reportage is habitually relegated to social media, which represents a privileged space where the diffusion of disinformation presents a threat to democratic processes. Deploying a place-based, person-centred approach towards investigating news production within communities in Cornwall, UK, this article reflects on a participatory action research project called the Citizen Journalism News Network (CJNN). The CJNN is an overt attempt to design disruptive systems for agenda setting through mass participation and engagement with social issues. The project was delivered within four communities via a twelve-week-long journalism course, and a bespoke online app. CJNN is a platform for citizen journalists to work collaboratively on investigating stories and raising awareness of social issues that directly affect the communities reporting on them.

TI  - CEO's education and investment-cash flow sensitivity: an empirical investigation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of financial and technical education of chief executive officer (CEO) on investment-cash flow sensitivity (ICFS) of Indian manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach The study uses the dynamic panel data model and more specifically, the system-generalized method of moments (GMM) technique to investigate the effect of CEOs' education on ICFS of Indian manufacturing firms during the period 1998-1999 to 2016-2017. Findings The study shows that financial (technical) education of CEOs does (not) affect ICFS. The results explain that the role of the CEO's education in ICFS is highly significant during the crisis period. The robustness test depicts that the influence of financial education on ICFS is less (more) for group-affiliated and large-sized firms (stand-alone and small-sized firms). Further, the CEO's education is significantly associated with corporate investment decisions. Research limitations/implications Due to the unavailability of the CEO's compensation data for the selected sample, future research could explore the impact of CEO's education with respect to CEO's compensation on ICFS. Practical implications First, the authors find that financially educated CEOs affect ICFS; therefore, firms should take care of CEO's education during recruitment of CEOs. Second, lending agencies should also consider the educational background of the CEO before approval of funding to make it safe. Third, investors should keep in mind the educational background of the CEO for the growth of their investment as it may be easier for financially educated CEOs to borrow from the market at the time of requirement. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence through analyzing the impact of a CEO's education on ICFS in the context of India. This study is very unique in itself as it uses the sample of manufacturing sectors of India, which are growing very fast and attracting global investors to create a global hub of manufacturing in India. This study also considers different types of education such as financial and technical education of CEOs in the context of a developing economy like India. This study made its findings robust across company characteristics and periods based on the financial crisis.

TI  - Peru's National Policy on Financial Inclusion and Its Alignment with Sustainable Development Goal I
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This article analyzes the implementation of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) and its alignment with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) I: Eradicate poverty. Despite the progress achieved, structural gaps persist and substantially limit the NFIS's contribution to poverty reduction, especially among rural, indigenous, extreme poverty, and other vulnerable groups. The article employs a mixed methods approach combining qualitative and quantitative techniques. On the qualitative side, a hermeneutic documentary analysis of the NFIS and related regulations was carried out, with a critical textual interpretation supported by specialized software. Quantitatively, descriptive statistical techniques were applied to analyze official financial inclusion indicators-methodological integration was achieved through analytical triangulation under a concurrent mixed methods approach. The progress of initiatives under the NFIS was evaluated, identifying limitations such as the digital divide in rural areas, limited financing for Micro and Small Enterprises, gaps in financial education, and growing exposure to digital fraud. Although the NFIS promotes greater access to financial services, it does not explicitly focus on the poorest and most excluded populations. Therefore, it is recommended that the objectives and indicators of the NFIS be reformulated to focus on universal access and effective use of financial services by the population in extreme poverty and chronic exclusion. In addition, a strategic articulation with social protection policies is necessary, as well as promoting culturally relevant microfinance and inclusive finance models, strengthening consumer protection, and consolidating public-private alliances in high-poverty areas. Finally, strong monitoring and accountability are also key.

TI  - Parents Influence Responsible Credit Use in Young Adults: Empirical Evidence from the United States, France, and Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - From the start of adulthood, consumers are frequently faced with complex financial decisions, and the consequences of these decisions may be reflected throughout the rest of their lives. As access to credit has expanded among college students around the world, it is critical that we understand both universal and culture-specific processes. Although some work has examined credit card use in two cultures simultaneously, there is, to our knowledge, no research examining such use in three cultures on three continents and across both genders. This study analyzes credit card use behavior among 1458 young adults living either in Brazil, the United States, or France. A structural equations model is used to incorporate relationships between the latent variables. The model, which was validated by the study, examines how financial well-being is affected by the way in which the individual uses credit cards, which in its turn is affected by social comparison and by financial self-confidence, the latter being also impacted by the financial education received from the parents. In the comparison between groups we found evidence that men are more dependent on parental education than women.

TI  - Dark financial profile leading to debt traps - A theoretical framework
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - This paper proposes a theoretical framework in an attempt to better explain the behaviours of some consumers of financial products during market crises. We review the established notions of irrationality and deception, and then add the construct of disconnection from financial needs, goals and preferences. We propone that these three concepts, respectively, cognitive, behavioural and emotional in nature, create a dark financial profile (DFP) by which these consumers unwittingly build debt. We use bibliometrics to highlight the current gap in the scholarly domains of interest and provide market examples of how the DFP likely deploys in the marketplace. This is the first article to use disconnection in such a context, and to improve the understanding of consumer behaviours in regard to disconnection, irrationality, deception and debt. Thus, we enrich the literature on debt, which has at times ignored the role of the combination of these constructs. We investigate avenues of research for developing further our emerging framework, especially on the notion of disconnection, and suggest that this effort may assist in preparing effective marketing of financial education programs and improving lending practices.

TI  - Validation of Scales to Research the Personal Financial Management
T2  - RBGN-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GESTAO DE NEGOCIOS
AB  - Purpose - The paper describes the test of preexistent scales to measure behaviors of personal financial management, buying impulsiveness and financial strain
   Design/methodology/approach - From the back translation of scales published in English, empirical research was carried out to certify the reliability and validity of these instruments. A survey through the internet was performed with 195 respondents (postgraduate students and teachers from five Brazilian states, related to business administration courses). Data were analyzed with exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, in addition to structural equation modeling, using the statistical software IBM SPSS and AMOS.
   Findings - The scales are reliable and showed construct validity. In the examination of scales' nomological validity, there is a negative association between buying impulsineness and financial management. Financial manegement this construct has a negative effect on financial strain, and partially mediates the positive relationship between impulsiveness and financial strain.
   Originality/value - Results motivate the use of a scales of the behavior of personal financial management in order to evaluate this trait of personal competence, supporting programs of financial education and the marketing planning of credit institutions.

TI  - Saving for a Rainy Day horizontal ellipsis or a Trip to the Bahamas? How the Framing of Investment Communication Impacts Retail Investors
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - Little is known to date regarding how the framing of investment communication impacts retail investor propensity to engage with financial products. To explore this lacuna, we apply insights from regulatory focus theory and construal level theory, and we vary investment communications in terms of the motivation (protect vs. achieve) and the time horizon (distant vs. near) presented in a 2 x 2 quasi-experimental design. We also include an analysis of investor characteristics and find that communication of 'short-term achieve' investments attracts particularly risk-tolerant and sensation-seeking individuals, posing questions of responsibility towards potentially vulnerable groups. We also find that negative attitudes towards finance may be troublesome, as they can stop individuals from engaging with 'long-term' investment products. Positive attitudes towards finance, in contrast, lead investors to engage with 'protect' products of both 'short-' and 'long-term' horizon, highlighting benefits for individuals and society from interventions aimed at financial education and exposure. The study concludes by discussing insights for the literature and practitioners from the application of new theory and new data to the management of investment communications.

TI  - Is Income Inequality Influenced by Financial Knowledge? A Macroeconomic and Longitudinal Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB  - Our objective is to analyze whether financial knowledge influences income inequality. For this purpose, we resort to a new index of financial knowledge that differs from the existing ones in that it is both longitudinal and macroeconomic. We use this index as one of the explanatory variables of the Net Gini Index in our panel data estimations. Based on a sample of 63 countries over the period 2008-2014, our results allow us to conclude that financial knowledge is related to income inequality and that, moreover, this relationship is non-linear. Thus, increases in financial knowledge could reduce income inequality when starting from relatively low levels of such knowledge. However, at a certain threshold, the income redistributive effect of financial knowledge could disappear or even reverse. Even so, national strategies for financial education could be useful to achieve economic equity in those countries where financial knowledge levels are low. In addition, we shed light on the effect that other variables (such as institutional quality or under-education) have on income inequality.

TI  - Financial Literacy in Ukraine and Hungary with special regard to the Performance of University Students
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - In 2002, the governments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) formally recognised the importance of financial literacy. It was then that the organisation launched a project to survey financial literacy, which has been called the International Network on Financial Education (OECD/INFE) since 2008. The organisation's 132 member countries take part in regular surveys, each using a uniform methodology. This method has become so popular with researchers that it is used by countries that are not members of the organisation/project. Ukraine is one of them. In this work, the authors compare the results of the Ukrainian study with the Hungarian data, taking advantage of the identity of the methodology. The choice fell on these two countries because the authors had an affiliation in Ukraine, but one of them lives in Hungary, so he has a personal relationship with both countries. The choice of topic was determined by the fact that one of their areas of scientific research is the study of the financial literacy of university students. The OECD published the results of its latest survey in 2020. The report also contains Hungarian data. The results show that the performance of both countries studied is close to, but not below, the OECD average; however, they are very close to each other. Nevertheless, the financial cultures of the two countries are significantly different. Ukrainians are more characterized by active management of finances, while Hungarians are attracted to finances above average. In addition to presenting the national results, the authors also compare the performance of Hungarian and Ukrainian university students in financial literacy.

TI  - Residential renewable energy adoption. Does financial literacy matter?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Clean energy production systems are the most effective and sustainable ways of protecting the natural environment from pollution. Sadly, fossil fuels remain a significant energy source in most emerging economies primarily due to financial challenges. Using Ghana's renewable energy policy initiatives as a case analysis, the study adopted a multiple-stage random sampling approach to sample household heads (N = 413) across two regions in Ghana to assess the adoption of renewable energies' impact of financial literacy among urban households by applying the two-stage residual inclusion technique. The study's findings depict that household income and RE cost are more significant variables impacting RE adoption, whereas the focal study variable, i.e., financial literacy, has some positive effect but at a lower level than these two variables (household income and RE cost). The heterogeneous analysis regarding household income level shows that financial literacy increases the ability to adopt renewable energy in high-income households than low-income households, confirming the significant impact of household income on RE adoption. The study results imply that policymakers in low-income countries should provide tax incentives for importers of renewable energy products/appliances and subsidize the prices for consumers to improve renewable energy technology use. Also, the provision of job opportunities and income diversification strategies education to improve household incomes should be a priority. Moreover, financial literacy through financial education programs in the formal education sector and the mass media to improve citizens' financial skills and knowledge should be prioritized. These recommendations have the potential to advance the financial and economic wellbeing of citizens in facilitating renewable energy transition.

TI  - DO WOMEN BEHAVE FINANCIALLY WORSE THAN MEN? EVIDENCE FROM MARRIED AND COHABITING COUPLES
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Extensive empirical evidence shows that women perform worse in financial literacy tests, which implies that their financial behaviour may also be worse compared to men. However, the literature on the gender gap in financial behaviour is scanty and highly inconclusive. Using data from a survey of married and cohabiting couples living in Poland (N=1,000) and a multi-dimensional scale validated in terms of its psychometric properties, this article compares the financial behaviour of women and men. The applied tests did not show any significant gender differences in the overall financial behaviour index or in any of the subdomains of the behaviour distinguished in the applied scale. Using the social identity theory as a framework, we discuss possible explanations of these puzzling findings, which may imply that women are unnecessarily considered a disadvantaged group in terms of preparedness to participate in financial life, including the business sphere.
   Implications for Central European audience: Assuming that the gender differences in financial literacy and behaviour can be explained on the grounds of the social identity theory, Central and Eastern Europe may differ from Western Europe in terms of the gender gap. Socially-imposed gender roles were presumably shaped differently behind the Iron Curtain, which resulted in that the distinction between masculine and feminine roles got blurred under the Soviet regime. As a result, the absence of gender differences in financial behaviour is more likely to occur in Central and Eastern European countries. Financial education initiatives should take this circumstance into account.

TI  - Financial Education in School of Business Students: Case Study from Veracruz, Mexico
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The purpose of the study is to evaluate the knowledge level and behavior that business school students from Veracruz, Mexico have in relation to interest rates, inflation, savings, credit and budgeting. For the empirical study, a non-experimental quantitative cross-sectioned and descriptive design was followed. The test used was that of Moreno-Garcia et al. (2017), which was answered by 309 undergraduate students from Veracruz, Mexico. Data measurement was performed using descriptive statistics, cross tables and the non-parametric test of proportions (Z). The main findings point to the fact that more students understand well the impact of inflation than the relationship between interest rates and bonds; that students do not consider that saving provides financial security; and that there is no gender difference in terms of saving behavior. Most of the business school students do not have a credit card, prefer debit cards and have acceptable practices in budget planning. In summary, the results of this study show a good level of financial knowledge in relation to interest rates, inflation, investment, credit, and show adequate behavior of savings and credit card, as well as the use of the budgets. However, it was expected that each item would have a greater number of correct answers, considering that the population under study has received training in mathematics, economics, and finance. It is noteworthy that, in relation to gender, there are more men who correctly answer the questions about inflation and it is women who have better practices in the use of their credit cards.

TI  - Personal finance behaviour: a reasoned action approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose This study sought to examine the impact of financial knowledge, financial attitude, locus of control and income on financial behaviour. Design/methodology/approach The study employed the reasoned action approach framework by Fishbein and Ajzen (2010), with formal sector workers in three districts of Ghana as the population. Questionnaires were used to collect data and analysed using partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). Findings The results of the study revealed that perceived financial knowledge, financial attitude and locus of control had a significant positive relationship with financial behaviour intention. The assertion that actual financial knowledge and income influence actual financial behaviour was not supported by the findings. However, income moderated significantly the intention-actual financial behaviour relationship. Practical implications The findings imply that having financial knowledge or earning a higher income in itself does not guarantee the good financial behaviour of people. It is recommended that financial education must focus on developing good financial attitudes and beliefs to enhance the needed behavioural change. Originality/value To the best of the researcher's knowledge, there is no study of financial behaviour that adopts the methodology and variables used in this research in Ghana.

TI  - Financial Literacy Level: An Empirical Study on Savings, Credit and Budget Management Habits in High School Students
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - In the majority of the countries, have exposed the need for people to have a higher level of financial education, which translates into better habits for saving and investing, in addition, they will have better decisions for the management of their personal finances which is translates into financial well-being, therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the financial literacy of high school students about saving habits, budgeting and credit; as well as, identify if it differs by gender. To do this, the hypothetical-deductive method is used, based on the seminal works of Bernheim, Garrett and Maki (2001) and Lusardi and Mitchell (2011). The sample is non-probabilistic by self-determination, therefore 256 students from four institutions participated in the Veracruz context, were surveyed. For the data descriptive analysis, in order to describe the main frequencies in each saving, credit and budget indicator, the cross table's procedure was carried out. To test hypothesis about gender differences, one-way ANOVA and Levene's test was applied. The main findings show slight differences between gender in some fundamental aspects of saving, credit and the use and management of the budget.

TI  - Supporting Young Families to Obtain and Manage Private Rental Accommodation: Experiences of a Community-Based Homelessness Program
T2  - AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGIST
AB  - Young homeless families are one of the most vulnerable groups in the community. While this group encounters the same difficulties as all homeless individuals, the addition of dependent children presents unique challenges. This research focuses on the young families supported by the Australian '' Hope to Home '' (H2H) pilot program and reports findings from a qualitative, thematic analysis of 16 one-toone semi-structured interviews with program participants. The program housed 27 dependent children, highlighting the need for services for young people with dependent children. The findings contribute to the development of community programs specifically designed for families. As evidenced in both design and participant experience, H2H offers a holistic service that integrates financial, housing, education, employment, social, and community supports. Having the lead agency head the lease and brokerage support was beneficial in accessing and maintaining private rentals. Case manager participation in day to day life involved the provision of financial, education, and advocacy support, which increased family stability in multiple areas. By partnering with local businesses and organisations and connecting families to their communities, H2H may also have longer term positive effects on inequality, stigma and discrimination.

TI  - Entrepreneurs on their financial literacy: evidence from the Netherlands
T2  - VENTURE CAPITAL
AB  - Using a representative survey of Dutch entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals, (i) we measure their subjective financial knowledge and the extent to which they ask for advice when managing their companies, and (ii) we examine whether subjective financial knowledge and the demand for advice are related to the firm economic performance. We find that the respondents feel more comfortable with accounting subjects than they do with strategic ones, of which they feel that they know the least. Entrepreneurs with a greater extent of financial knowledge are more likely to report a higher gross margin and higher revenue growth for their firm. These entrepreneurs are also less likely to seek advice and to delegate financial decisions. Seeking professional advice does not increase the likelihood of an entrepreneur having better performance. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs' degree of financial knowledge is related to the success of their businesses, while seeking advice is not significantly correlated with better firm performance.

TI  - Can Education Unlock Scale? The Demand Impact of Educational Games on a Large-Scale Unsubsidised Index Insurance Programme in Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
AB  - There is increasing concern that voluntary index insurance may fail to produce sustainable impacts at scale. Despite this concern, most research is focused on experimental or highly subsidised projects - little is known about farmer demand for market priced, commercially focused index insurance. We estimate the impact of attending a randomly administered education game for index insurance on the likelihood of purchase in the context of an unsubsidised, non-loan-linked commercial insurance programme in Ethiopia. This programme has already scaled to the tens of thousands via labour-based liquidity programmes and cash only sales. We find that the likelihood of purchasing unsubsidised insurance in commercial sales rose by an average of 10 per cent across villages, and that the average amount of insurance purchased increased by 33 per cent. These results demonstrate a possibility for financial education to increase demand, particularly among the subset of farmers who are not eligible for liquidity programmes.

TI  - Implementing innovative financial models in different cultures A comparative analysis of China and Mexico
T2  - CROSS CULTURAL & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present evidence about cultural differences between Mexico and China, and analyze their significance when implementing an innovative financial model. Specifically, the authors analyzed the case of the Yunus model (or Grameen model), originally developed in Bangladesh and further implemented in China and Mexico.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses a comparative quantity study to test the cultural difference which affects the innovative financial model implementation. A materialism and credit overuse value scale (Ponchio and Aranha, 2008; Richins, 2011; Roberts and Jones, 2001) is applied to analyze cultural differences with a sample of 250 people in each country.
   Findings - The results show that the survey responses are statistically significantly different in these two countries. The Mexican sample shows a greater affinity with luxury and bragging. The Chinese sample shows more responsibility toward credit. Recommendations for the implementation of the innovative financial model considering cultural differences are suggested.
   Practical implications - Based on the survey results, gender equality, greater caution with young borrowers, financial education programs, and strict liability agreements to ensure credit repayment, especially for Mexico, are suggested, with the aim of enabling microfinance institutions to increase the successful implementation of the Yunus model in China and Mexico.
   Originality/value - There are few existing cultural comparisons between China and Mexico. Therefore, one of the relevant contributions of this work is to shed light on the cultural differences of these two important emerging economies for future research. Additionally, the authors applied a materialism and credit overuse value scale developed to assess consumer behavior as a proxy for culture. The results are relevant for further usage of this scale as a tool to help adapt innovative financial models for application in other cultures.

TI  - Financial performance and capital structure - an econometric approach for Romanian e-commerce companies during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB  - The study investigates the inverse relationship between financial performance and capital structure for the Romanian B2C e-commerce companies, based on a representative sample of 437 companies active in the period 2005-2020. Statistical analyzes show the evolution of financial performance and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on it, depending on the company category. All company categories had better financial performance in 2020 compared to 2019, based on sample results. The study reveals valid reference values for the financial ratios of Romanian electronic commerce, being a model to be applied in any industry. The analysis of the causality of the financial variables and their correlations, on the sub-periods 20 05-20 08 and 2009-2020, both at the company category level and at the sample level, are the basis of the GMM approach. The econometric models Difference GMM and System GMM explain the relationship between financial performance and capital structure leading to interesting conclusions. As e-commerce has a sustainable development, the findings and conclusions of the study provide guidance for economic policies at the sectoral level. Financial performance in relation to strategic debt management depends on the company category. Stimulating the development of those categories of companies that ensure the efficient performance framework can be the key to a sustainable development of the national economy. The study is useful for managers, investors, financial analysts, decision makers, in financial education as well as for the banking system. (c) 2024 Economic Society of Australia, Queensland.

TI  - Will the EU Commission Successfully Integrate Sustainability Risks and Factors in the Investor Protection Regime? A Research Agenda
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Building a common EU framework for sustainable finance undoubtedly implies the integration of sound and sustainable processes and skills across the whole structure and governance of financial institutions. Consequently, a new financial paradigm is going to be needed, which will require the strengthening of investor care and protection, so contributing to the restoration of trust in the financial sector. In particular, on 18 December 2018, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) launched two public consultations on draft technical advice for the integration of sustainability risks and factors into the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID), the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), and the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) regimes, with the aim to clarify the so-called fiduciary duties and to increase transparency in the financial services industry. However, the success of the EU initiatives on investor protection regulation may be seriously endangered by the existence of many challenges, weaknesses, and contradictions raised by economists and stakeholders in relation to the definition of sustainability, ESG data availability and reliability, the development of an EU taxonomy, conflicts of interest, product governance, and suitability assessment. This paper starts by briefly analyzing the recent developments of the regulation of sustainable finance at the global level, then offers a more detailed view on the establishment of a common regime on sustainable finance in the EU, with particular reference to the action plan 'Financing Sustainable Growth'. Then, it examines the recent proposals for regulation on sustainable finance, specifically considering the barriers to the integration of sustainability risks and factors in the EU investor protection regulation-with particular reference to investment services-with respect to its four main dimensions: (1) disclosure of product information, (2) conduct of business (COB) rules, (3) product governance and intervention, and (4) financial education. The paper concludes that the EU reforming proposals, though admirable, risk oversimplifying a complex issue that cannot be easily solved without considering its practical implications on each category of financial operators in the performance of different financial services.

TI  - Learning environment and primary school efficiency A DEA bootstrap truncated regression analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose Existing studies of school efficiency primarily specify teacher inputs as the number of teachers and perhaps the student-teacher ratio. As a result, there is no direct qualitative recognition of the learning environment. The purpose of this paper is to incorporate the learning environment directly into the assessment of school efficiency. Design/methodology/approach The authors employ data envelopment analysis to derive efficiency scores and the double-bootstrap truncated regression approach in Simar and Wilson's (2007) Journal of Econometrics to quantify the sources of efficiency in 430 Queensland state primary schools. In the first stage, the outputs of student National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy scores and the inputs of full-time equivalent teaching staff and cumulative capital expenditure per student are used to measure efficiency. In the second stage, the authors specify an index of community socio-educational advantage, class size, the share of teachers with postgraduate qualifications, funds spent on professional development, and surveyed opinions from parents/caregivers, students, staff and principals on the learning environment to explain these measures of efficiency. Findings Socio-economic background and the teaching environment affect school efficiency. Although not all variables related to teacher contribution are significant, there is evidence to suggest that teachers have a positive influence on student performance hence school efficiency. Teachers ability to clearly explain the requirements of schoolwork tasks and listening to student opinions sets an ideal student engagement environment which can have a profound impact on student learning.
   Practical implications - From a policy perspective, policy makers should target resources at inefficient schools aimed at enhancing student learning through teacher development and, at the same time, providing financial and non-financial educational assistance to students and their families from a low socio-educational background.Originality/value This is the first large-scale primary school efficiency analysis to incorporate the Simar and Wilson (2007) approach to explaining the determinants of efficiency, including teaching environment from the perspective of students, teachers and other stakeholders.

T2  - COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to examine the nexus between digital financial literacy and customers' perceived financial behavior within the Kuwaiti context. Moreover, it will further explore how digital financial literacy relates to financial behavior dimensions.Design/methodology/approachData collection was facilitated by creating a questionnaire derived from multiple literature sources. This study used a cross-sectional, time-based dimension. Data was analyzed using the partial least square (PLS) structural equation modeling approach, using the Smart-PLS 4 software for computation.FindingsFindings demonstrated a significant relationship between digital financial literacy and financial behavior, with a path coefficient of 0.542, a p-value of 0.000 and an R2 value of 0.581. The explorative model revealed substantial relationships between many dimensions of digital financial literacy and various dimensions of financial behavior. More precisely, financial knowledge, awareness and decision-making were the factors that had the most significant impact on financial behavior.Practical implicationsKuwaiti policymakers should consider including digital financial literacy programs in comprehensive financial education programs to improve public understanding of digital financial instruments and their consequences.Originality/valueAs the authors know, this is the initial endeavor to evaluate the relationship between digital financial literacy, financial behavior and their respective dimensions.

TI  - How do demographic and socioeconomic factors affect financial literacy and its variables?
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate various relationships between demographic and socioeconomic factors and financial literacy variables. Instead of using two or three variables as commonly adopted in the literature, this study employed multivariable analysis to investigate financial literacy. The sample of this research was 255 faculty members on Java Island, Indonesia. This study was a discrete moderator test; therefore, it employed a multigroup analysis (MGA) via the partial least squares of structural equations modeling (PLS-SEM) to determine which group of demographics and socioeconomic factors influencing the relationship of the financial literacy variables. This study revealed that demographic factors of sex, age, and specialization affected different relationship of financial skills, knowledge, capability, awareness, experience, goal, and financial decision. This study also provided empirical evidence that the socioeconomic factor of consumption spending affected the different relationships between financial awareness and skills. The results proved that demographic and socioeconomic factors enhanced financial literacy. Assessing financial literacy levels in different demographic and socioeconomic factors, as a key factor in accomplishing a successful national strategy for financial education, allows policymakers to identify gaps and design appropriate responses. This result emphasizes that strengthening awareness and experience as future orientations could improve financial literacy levels in developing countries.

TI  - Exploring the impact of financial literacy on predicting credit default among farmers: An analysis using a hybrid machine learning model
T2  - BORSA ISTANBUL REVIEW
AB  - This study explores whether financial literacy can enhance the ability to predict credit default by farmers using machine-learning models. It introduces a hybrid model combining k-means clustering and Adaboost to predict loan default using data on 10,396 farmers who obtained credit from Chinese rural commercial banks, including demographics, household finance, credit history, and financial literacy. We systemically compare the results of models with and without financial literacy variables, which indicate significant improvement in the predictive accuracy about credit risk when financial literacy factors are included. Our findings confirm that financial literacy is a crucial indicator of farmers' ability to make informed financial decisions, reducing their likelihood of loan default and suggesting its utility as a screening tool or supplementary credit risk assessment variable. This research has profound implications for financial inclusion and credit risk management, indicating that financial institutions can leverage financial literacy data to evaluate farmers' creditworthiness and design effective financial education programs. This study enriches the literature on credit risk prediction by introducing financial literacy as a predictor of credit default.

TI  - Digital financial services usage and subjective financial well-being: evidence from low-income households in Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThe first objective of this study is to analyze whether financial behavior (FB), financial stress (FS), financial literacy (FINLIT) and the locus of control (LOC) influence subjective financial well-being (SFWB) among low-income households in Malaysia. The second objective is to investigate whether the use of digital financial services (DFS) moderates the influence of FB and FS, on SFWB.Design/methodology/approachMotivated by the literature on transformative service research (TRS), this study examines how the use of DFS impact SFWB among low-income households in Malaysia. Low-income households are chosen as they are more likely to be financially excluded and lack financial knowledge and skills. Using an interviewer-administered survey, trained enumerators collected data from 1,948 low-income households in Malaysia, selected using a two-stage sampling based on the National Household Sampling Frame obtained from the Department of Statistics Malaysia.FindingsResults reveal that SFWB is positively influenced by FB and the LOC, and is negatively impacted by FS and FINLIT. The evidence shows that the use of DFS counterintuitively weakened the strength of the relationship between FB and SFWB, but effectively reduced the adverse effect of FS on SFWB.Practical implicationsTo reverse the signs of relationship, financial services marketers need to identify the specific types of DFS that low-income households use in order to provide targeted marketing efforts and financial education to promote the use of DFS on a more holistic basis to increase financial well-being.Originality/valueThe findings of this study add to the body of knowledge deliberating on the opposing effects of technology on consumers' welfare and well-being. This study focuses on the lower-income stratum of Malaysian households as this group of the population is more likely to be financially excluded and have deficiencies in financial knowledge and skills. Findings of this study show that DFS use can actually diminish the positive impact of FB on SFWB while reducing the adverse effect of FS on SFWB.

TI  - ICT-equipped bank boat and the financial inclusion of the riverine population of Marajo Island in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL
AB  - The challenge in offering public services in less developed areas in Brazil has mobilized the government in search of new and creative approaches that can reduce major interregional disparities, including lack of access to the financial system, which is the prevailing situation on Marajo Island in the state of Para in the Brazilian Amazon. To transform this reality, an information and communication technology (ICT)-equipped travelling bank branch installed on a boat-named Agencia Barco-was designed for the purpose of meeting the financial needs of the riverine population that lives in a vast territory with low population density, marked transportation difficulties, and a limited supply of ICT. Thus, this research aims to assess the impact of this bank boat in the financial inclusion of a riverine population of Marajo Island in the state of Para, which is the unit of analysis of this work. The research outcomes indicate that Agencia Barco, via ICT, has partially managed to provide access to financial products and services that might be of interest to the riverine population of Marajo Island. However, the lack of basic financial education and context-based issues related to the ICT infrastructure has been obstacles to the financial inclusion of this riverine population. Finally, the absence of involvement of local people in this endeavour has not stimulated dynamics of empowerment and participation that could lead to sustainable financial inclusion.

TI  - INVESTMENT LITERACY, RISK TOLERANCE AND MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF WORKING ADULTS IN KUALA LUMPUR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - Financial literacy empowers consumers to make more informed financial decisions, including investing in mutual funds. In this study, the sociodemographic profile of working adults with low investment literacy visa-vis high investment literacy are examined first. Next, the impact of investment literacy and risk tolerance on the likelihood of investing in mutual funds are explored. Among a sample of 260 working adults comprising mainly of Masters of Business Administration (MBA) students from a leading public higher institution in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the study shows that those with Business/Economics education backgrounds have the highest investment literacy and are more likely to invest in mutual funds compared to individuals from the Arts and other miscellaneous backgrounds. Although Muslims are the least literate in investment matters, they are more likely to hold mutual fund investments relative to those who profess Christianity and Hinduism. Individuals with relatively high income and occupational levels have relatively higher investment literacy. Risk tolerance does not influence the likelihood of investing in mutual fund investments. Policymakers should focus on females, those with Arts education background, Muslims, and those from the lower income/employment ranks to increase their investment literacy through financial education workshops. Mutual fund companies may consider embarking an aggressive knowledge sharing videos related to mutual funds via non-mainstream media such as social media to increase the penetration of mutual fund investments, among the untapped markets.

TI  - Does Geographical Discrimination Exist in Online Lending in China: An Empirical Study Based on Chinese Loan Platform Renren
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - Background: Online lending has developed rapidly in China in recent years, into a typical Internet financial model. China's online lending related issues have received widespread attention from scholars. Methods: This study used 396,634 order data-points (935,037 original order data-points) from the Renren Loan website since its inception in January 2017. We used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to study the problem of geographical discrimination in online lending in China, and we conducted two robust tests. Results: Studies have shown that significant geographical discrimination exists in China's online lending market. From the perspective of the lender, different investment intentions exist for borrowers from various regions, thereby leading to variations in the success rates of loans. From the perspective of the borrower, the belief exists that borrowers from different regions will have varying interest rates because of the effect of geographical discrimination. Conclusion: We believe that geographical discrimination is due to the effects of the economic, financial, educational, and ethnic conditions of the borrower's location on willingness to invest and the success rate of borrowing. However, borrowers' self-discrimination is primarily related to economic and ethnic differences among provinces.

TI  - Effect of savings-led economic empowerment on HIV preventive practices among orphaned adolescents in rural Uganda: results from the Suubi-Maka randomized experiment
T2  - AIDS CARE-PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-MEDICAL ASPECTS OF AIDS/HIV
AB  - Improving economic resources of impoverished youth may alter intentions to engage in sexual risk behaviors by motivating positive future planning to avoid HIV risk and by altering economic contexts contributing to HIV risk. Yet, few studies have examined the effect of economic-strengthening on economic and sexual behaviors of orphaned youth, despite high poverty and high HIV infection in this population. Hierarchal longitudinal regressions were used to examine the effect of a savings-led economic empowerment intervention, the Suubi-Maka Project, on changes in orphaned adolescents' cash savings and attitudes toward savings and HIV-preventive practices over time. We randomized 346 Ugandan adolescents, aged 10-17 years, to either the control group receiving usual orphan care plus mentoring (n = 167) or the intervention group receiving usual orphan care plus mentoring, financial education, and matched savings accounts (n = 179). Assessments were conducted at baseline, 12, and 24 months. Results indicated that intervention adolescents significantly increased their cash savings over time (b = $US12.32, +/- 1.12, p < .001) compared to adolescents in the control group. At 24 months post-baseline, 92% of intervention adolescents had accumulated savings compared to 43% in the control group (p < .001). The largest changes in savings goals were the proportion of intervention adolescents valuing saving for money to buy a home (Delta(T)(1-T0) = +14.9, p < .001), pursue vocational training (Delta(T)(1-T0) = +8.8, p < .01), and start a business ((T1-T0) = +6.7, p < .01). Intervention adolescents also had a significant relative increase over time in HIV-preventive attitudinal scores (b = +0.19, +/- 0.09, p < .05), most commonly toward perceived risk of HIV (95.8%, n = 159), sexual abstinence or postponement (91.6%, n = 152), and consistent condom use (93.4%, n = 144). In addition, intervention adolescents had 2.017 significantly greater odds of a maximum HIV-prevention score (OR = 2.017, 95%CI: 1.43-2.84). To minimize HIV risk throughout the adolescent and young adult periods, long-term strategies are needed to integrate youth economic development, including savings and income generation, with age-appropriate combination prevention interventions.

TI  - Financial literacy among Malaysian Muslim undergraduates
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose
   University students are known to face many challenges in achieving high financial literacy. The purpose of this paper is to examine the level of financial literacy among Malaysian Muslim undergraduates as explained through sociocultural variables. Furthermore, this paper explores a few additional Islamic measurements as part of assessing the level of financial literacy among the students.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The questionnaires were drafted based on a multi-dimensional financial literacy model and distributed conveniently to 330 respondents. Post-interviews were also conducted with selected students to further comprehend the sociocultural context.
   Findings
   The findings suggest that exposing students to financial education and practices influence their financial literacy scores. Students who attended muamalat-related courses demonstrated better financial literacy scores. Meanwhile, post-interview results indicate that the students' social environment and interactions also play important roles in enhancing their financial literacy. Hence, it is believed that it is essential to embed Islamic-based measurements to equip students with financial literacy in tandem with their pedagogic development. The results thus extend previous studies by confirming the importance of Islamic-based finance- and business-related knowledge for all tertiary students. Furthermore, the curricula should be made compatible to their studying environment and attuned to their values and cultures.
   Social implications
   The study indicates the importance of high financial literacy among tertiary students for them to have a financially stable future.
   Originality/value
   The research is original in its use of several measurements of financial literacy that embedded Islamic teachings concomitant to the Muslim respondents.

TI  - Gender, Education, and Financial Socialization as Determinants of Financial Knowledge: An Empirical Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The main aim of the paper is to assess the level of financial literacy among business students. It further aims to investigate the role of external factors that may determine financial literacy. The external factors considered in this study are gender, grade point average, specialization, financial education, and financial socialization. Standard scales such as the Test of Financial Literacy, the Big Three, and other instruments were adapted to measure Financial Knowledge. Further, the study also explored relationships between several factors and the financial knowledge of students. These factors included a student's gender, specialization, number of finance or related courses studied, current Grade Point Average, and financial socialization. A total number of 303 valid responses were received through an online questionnaire administered to business students studying in a public university in the country. Statistical tests namely independent samples t-Test, one-way ANOVA, and correlation analysis were performed in SPSS 28.0. Results show that the overall financial knowledge of students is above average. Gender, number of finance or related courses, and financial socialization do not exhibit any significant relationship with financial knowledge. Current GPA and specialization show significant relationships. The findings of this study have important sectoral and research implications.

TI  - The Effect of National Business Systems on Social and Environmental Disclosure: A Comparison between Brazil and Canada
T2  - RBGN-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GESTAO DE NEGOCIOS
AB  - Purpose - This paper evaluates the influence of the institutional environment on the extent of social and environmental disclosure of companies from institutionally distant countries.
   Design/methodology/approach - We analyze basic materials, oil and gas, and public utility companies with shares traded on the Brazilian stock exchange (BM&FBovespa) and Canadian stock exchange (Toronto Stock Exchange) from 2007 to 2015. Quantitative methods are adopted through descriptive statistics and panel data analysis. The econometric modeling considers environmental and social disclosure as dependent variables, independent variables that represent the political, financial, educational and labor systems, and firm size, ROA, and indebtedness as control variables.
   Findings - In the case of the companies operating in Brazil, the extent of environmental and social disclosure is positively related to the political and labor systems, and negatively related to the financial system. In Canada, disclosure is negatively influenced by the financial system and the education system. The control variables, which represent characteristics of financial performance, were not significant.
   Originality/value - The study shows that isomorphic forces operate in the institutional field and affect the adoption of socially responsible behavior. By basing the study on institutionally distinct countries, such as Brazil and Canada, it reinforces the influence of the national business system on the extent of disclosure of environmental and social practices.

TI  - Cognitive ability and stock market participation: evidence from China
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - PurposeIt is imperative for policymakers, financial institutions, and individual investors to comprehend the factors that impact stock market participation, given the growing significance of the stock market in terms of personal and national wealth. This study endeavours to explore the relationship between cognitive ability and participation in the stock market. We examine the relationship between cognitive abilities and stock market participation, and further explore the mechanism of their influence.Design/methodology/approachThe data from the China Family Panel Studies is utilized, and Tobit and Probit regressions are employed. Additionally, an instrumental variable approach (IV-estimate) is implemented to address the endogeneity issue linked to cognitive ability, and the study's findings are resilient.FindingsThe results reveal a significant positive relationship between cognitive ability and stock market participation. Additionally, the findings suggest that households with higher cognitive ability tend to aggregate more information, expand social networks, and take more risks. A likely explanation is that individuals with higher cognitive ability are more likely to process more external information and evaluate the subjective uncertainty of stock markets based on a well-defined probability distribution. Our findings indicate that the impact of cognitive ability on stock market participation varies among families with differing education levels, genders, marital statuses, and geographical locations.Originality/valueTherefore, the roles of cognitive abilities in accelerating stock market participation should be fully considered. More information channels and sources that contain financial markets' information (e.g. mobile applications and financial education) should be provided. Thus, the significance of cognitive ability in increasing stock market participation should be fully considered. Providing more information channels and sources, such as mobile applications and financial education, that contain financial markets' information would be helpful. Our study contributes to promoting financial literacy and inclusion by highlighting the significant positive impact of cognitive ability, where institutions can tailor their outreach efforts and information channels to better serve individuals with different cognitive ability.

TI  - The impact of Islamic work ethics on organisational culture among Muslim staff
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB  - Muslim scholars have defined ethics as enduring traits and characteristics in the individual that cause actions appropriate to those traits to be issued spontaneously without the need for human thought and reflection. Islamic ethics state the rightness or wrongness of these attributes within the framework of Islamic concepts, while the concepts of Islamic work ethics deal with the functioning of the framework of Islamic concepts in the form of human work activities in various organisations. Furthermore, work ethics can be effective in the organisation when it can shape the culture of the organisation. Research shows that Islamic work ethics have a significant relationship with various individual, professional and organisational factors. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between Islamic work ethics and organisational culture. The statistical population of this research consists of 1500 Muslim staff of 30 service organisations (financial, educational, medical and hotel organisations) in Moscow, Russia, in 2021, of which 306 people have been selected as statistical samples using Krejcie and Morgan's sample size table. Data analyses were performed by statistical software, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The results of this study confirm the significant and positive relationship between Islamic work ethics and organisational culture among the Muslim Russian staff (beta = 0.53; T = -8.65). Contribution: This study examines the relationship between Islamic work ethics and organisational culture in Russia and has expanded the results of previous studies conducted in other contexts.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Credit Accessibility of Rice Farmers in Pakistan: Analysis for Central Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Regions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study investigates the factors that affect farmers' access to Food Security and Agricultural Credit (FSAC) services for the farmers of Pakistan who have no access to banking but have a feasible farm business. Using multiple regressions and logistic analysis, the authors revealed the determinants of farmers' financial literacy and analyzed the variables which affected the farmers' accessibility to FSAC. Results indicated that the average financial literacy of respondents was at a moderate level. It was affected by the age of respondents, length of their education, distance to nearby cities, ownership of bank accounts, annual income, and financial education experience. The FSAC accessibility was also impacted by the area of cultivated land, interest rate, collateral, farms' income, financial literacy index, credit accessibility experiences, the legal status of farmer groups, and the amount of a loan. Some of the issues that prevent farmers from having widespread access to the FSAC include the lack of loan need, lack of FSAC awareness, lack of collateral, loan usury perspective, loan rejection experience, fear of borrowing from the bank, and inactive farmer groups. The study contributes to the existing literature on the determinants of farmers' access and choice of credit sources by using a primary data set.

TI  - Knowledge creates value: the role of financial literacy in entrepreneurial behavior
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Under the backdrop of economic globalization and the digital economy, entrepreneurial behavior has emerged not only as a focal point of management research but also as an urgent topic within the domain of family finance. This paper scrutinizes the ramifications of financial literacy on household entrepreneurial behavior utilizing data from China's sample of the China Household Finance Survey spanning the years 2015 and 2017. Employing the ordered Probit model, we pursue our research objectives. Our findings suggest that financial literacy exerts immediate, persistent, and evolving positive effects on households' engagement in entrepreneurial activities and their proclivity toward entrepreneurship. Through the mitigation of endogeneity in the regression model, the outcomes of the two-stage regression corroborate the primary regression results. An examination of heterogeneity unveils noteworthy disparities between urban and rural areas, as well as gender discrepancies, in how financial literacy influences household entrepreneurial behavior. Furthermore, this study validates three potential pathways-namely income, social network, and risk attitude channels-demonstrating that financial literacy significantly augments household income, expands social networks, and enhances risk attitudes. Moreover, through supplementary analysis, we ascertain that financial education amplifies the impact of financial literacy on entrepreneurial behavior. Our study contributes to the enrichment of human capital theory and modern entrepreneurship theory. It advocates for robust efforts by governments and financial institutions to widely disseminate financial knowledge and foster family entrepreneurship, thereby fostering the robust and stable operation of both the global financial market and the job market.

TI  - Financial socialization and financial distress: The role of cognitive and noncognitive abilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - This study investigated the influence of financial socialization on financial distress and demonstrated the importance of both cognitive and noncognitive ability channels through which this relation operates. Using data from a nationally representative sample of adult US residents, the results showed that adults in the bottom quintile of financial socialization are significantly more likely to experience financial distress than those in the top quintile. We also provide evidence that financial socialization is related to financial distress both directly and indirectly through cognitive ability measures of financial knowledge and financial skills, as well as the noncognitive ability measure of financial self-control. The findings highlight the importance of financial socialization in familial contexts. Implications for personal finance advocates, financial educators, children and family service providers, and policymakers are discussed.

TI  - "How" and "When" CEO Duality Matter? Case of a Developing Economy
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - This study addresses the questions of "How" and "When" CEO duality affects firm performance from a developing country's perspective. To address the research question, CEO duality serves as an explanatory variable, board effectiveness as a mediator, CEO personal characteristics as moderator, firm-specific characteristics as control, and performance indicators as a dependent variable. Our dataset comprises 163 Pakistani firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for 2009 to 2018. Results demonstrate that CEO's duality negatively affects a firm's financial performance; however, board effectiveness mediates the link between CEO duality and firm performance. The results support the agency theory framework. Furthermore, findings proposed that the CEO's attributes (age, gender, and financial education) significantly moderate the link between a CEO's duality and firm performance. The findings may be generalized among the developing countries and net 11 (N-11) specifically. The current study claims to be the first one that explores the mediating role of the board effectiveness and moderating role of the CEO personal attributes together on a duality-performance link employing Pakistan's corporate data. The findings suggest that policymakers and regulators ensure separation of power between Chairman and CEO to assure transparency through induction of more independence in the board room.

TI  - Examination of the Status of Financial Inclusion and Its Determinants in Tanzania
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The primary motive of this paper is to examine the determinants of financial inclusion in Tanzania. The paper borrows data from a household survey conducted by TWAWEZA. Employing the probit regression, the findings of this paper reveal that gender, education, age and income are the pertinent factors which affect the financial inclusion in Tanzania. The paper further shows the following: First, if you are a man, financially stable, have a good education and are relatively older, you then stand better chances of being financially included. The results show that, as the level of education increases, the individual is more likely to be financially included. The possible reason for this observation may be clearly linked with the financial ability of educated individuals to afford holding bank accounts and presenting personal guarantees when required by the banks during loan application because the level of education goes parallel with the income level. In addition, the results confirm a gender gap in formal financial inclusion, and this may be due to the factors such as inability of women to show collateral, their poor financial education awareness and lower business experience. Second, the paper also shows that the factors which affect traditional banking services are the same as those affecting mobile banking services (gender, age, income and education), and that there is a negative trend and a clear departure of customers' usage from banking retail services to mobile financial services. Although this gap has been narrowed recently, the best option with the banking sector is to create more new delivery channels while using mobile financial services as an infrastructure to deepen financial access reaching more un-banked population. The paper, therefore, recommends banks to create more delivery channels while using mobile telecommunication network as an infrastructure to deepen financial access reaching more unbanked people rather than competing with mobile network operators. The findings of this paper may also be used as a wake-up call for policy makers to put more emphasis on women and young people who are often left behind during Government's effort toward reaching the entire population as far as financial inclusion is concerned.

TI  - COVID-19 and stock market nexus: evidence from Shanghai Stock Exchange
T2  - ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB  - The outbreak of the contagious pandemic Covid-19 has disturbed various economic and business activities across the globe. This has resulted in the declination of cash flows and revenues, which significantly increases the probability of corporate bankruptcies and adversely affects the stock market performance. The current study investigated the Covid-19 and stock market nexus whilst considering the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSX). Covid-19 active cases and deaths have been considered proxies for the Covid-19 from 1 April 2020 to 30 July 2020. For empirical analysis, this study utilised quantile regression and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS). Empirical findings of both quantile regression and DOLS illustrate that both the Covid-19 active cases and deaths significantly decline the SSX closing index. However, the quantile estimates reveal that from lower (0.25) quantile to medium (0.50) to higher (0.75) quantile, the magnitude of these variables is found declining. Moreover, the frequency domain causality test confirmed the unidirectional causal relationship between the study variables, running from Covid-19 cases and deaths to the SSX. The findings are robust, which leads to providing practical policy implications that identified the need to revise health-finance-related policies and financial education to combat such circumstances in the future.

TI  - The Role of Accounting in Managing Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs): The Case of Indonesia
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic affects the economy of a country as well as its Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The MSMEs contribute to the economy of a country's GDP and can engross the workforce. In the case of Indonesia, 99% of MSMEs are micro-and small-businesses that need an intervention program from the Government. Having Accounting skills is important to manage MSMEs, as indicated by the OECD report (2017) regarding financial education. Unfortunately, the level of education that the owners of micro to small businesses have is relatively low and therefore, the program should be developed carefully considering the educational background of the sector. Training these business owners on simple accounting skills, which are critically important such as cash in and out records, may be suitable for micro and small businesses. In addition, recognition of their existence is also important by providing them with a business certificate from the city council. The certificate can also be used as a basis to allocate temporary space for the business that does the trading in the street market. Having the certificate recorded and maintained by the city council, as well as the simple financial record, can be used by the Government to base intervention programs such as financial and skill training as well as access to financial support or loan.3

TI  - Financial education via television comedy
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - We show that television may be able to deliver rudimentary financial literacy in a cost-effective manner. In a controlled experiment, Cambodian garment factory workers were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: no video (baseline), slideshow and comedy TV show. After the intervention, to examine whether individuals were able to internalize the information that was provided, participants were asked to answer a set of questions on financial knowledge and attitudes. Our results show that participants randomly assigned to the comedy show are significantly more likely to report that they are interested in obtaining more information on savings accounts and are also significantly more likely to open a savings account in the next 6 months. This method of delivery may prove effective particularly for the disadvantaged sections of the population in remote regions of Cambodia.

TI  - Antecedents of consumer indebtedness in a majority-Muslim country: Assessing the moderating effects of gender and religiosity using PLS-MGA
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - The aim of this research was to investigate the mechanisms that explain why people choose to buy on credit in a majority-Muslim country context. We propose and test a thorough model explaining the key behavioral and demographic factors leading to attitude towards debt, materialism, and consumer indebtedness. Materialism is assessed as a mediator in the effect of attitude towards debt on consumer indebtedness, and the moderating effects of gender and Islamic religiosity were examined and analyzed using Multi-Group analysis (MGA). Based on data collected from 1,294 Moroccan households, we empirically tested the conceptual model using structural equation modeling. This empirical study is the first of its type to address consumer indebtedness in the MENA region. Our findings allow a better comprehension of consumer indebtedness and have a potential to help in promoting enhanced public policies, better promotional campaigns, and fruitful financial education programs for households in similar markets.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 on consumer behavior in retail banking. Evidence from Romania
T2  - MANAGEMENT & MARKETING-CHALLENGES FOR THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY
AB  - The pandemic COVID-19 has severely affected the global economy. The strict lockdown measures have also changed the daily live, including consumer behavior in retail banking. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on consumer behavior in retail banking, with a special focus on the Romanian banking sector. To achieve our goal, we performed a survey among the Romanian consumers in retail banking, using as research method the field survey based on questionnaire. The final sample comprised 738 valid responses from the metropolitan area retail banking consumers. The research brings a fresh insight on retail banking services consumption during the pandemic and validates a conceptual model regarding the internet and mobile banking services acceptance. The research' results highlighted, among others, that the variable concerning the perception of the COVID-19 pandemic effect on consumers' lifestyle has a direct and positive influence on the variable regarding the attitude toward internet and mobile banking services, mediated by other variables like safety of internet and mobile banking use and trust in banks. Several social and managerial implications are also discussed, because it is possible that the tendency to use internet and mobile banking services will prevail even after the post pandemic stage, as new consumption behavior models are developing. Banks in Romania should increase their initiatives to offer financial education courses and online tutorials to familiarize customers with the use of digital channels. Banks should also improve communication with clients and design new products and services to increase the attractiveness of saving process. They should demonstrate flexibility in negotiating lending and refinancing conditions as well.

T2  - INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS
AB  - Although SMEs make significant contributions to socio-economic conditions of countries, they face many financial, organizational and mercantile obstacles in their operations. In this regard, having more innovative, risk-taking and proactive activities (EO) increases SMEs' performance, financial conditions and help them to survive in the long term. Therefore, finding regional, national and international differences in EO of SMEs can enable policymakers, financing institutions, SMEs, and entrepreneurs to create more opportunities for SMEs to overcome those problems. In this regard, this research seeks to explore the differences between entrepreneurial orientation (EO) of SMEs that operate in different regions of countries with various cultural values, income levels, economic, political and legal risks. Moreover, age and size of firms are also considered to find differences among SMEs in national and international contexts. In line with these objectives, the current study examines two different countries that have cultural differences and have different economic, legal and political risks. To achieve the objectives, 1620 Czech and Turkish SMEs were analyzed by performing the Mann-Whitney U and Moran's I spatial autocorrelation tests. According to the results of Moran's I autocorrelation test, this research does not find any differences between the low and high-income regions of the selected countries regarding EO of SMEs. Experience and age of the respondents might be the reason for these results. Significant results in the national context are that EO of SMEs does not differ across the age categories, while there are differences between firm size and their EO. In the international context, the main findings are that Czech SMEs are more proactive than Turkish ones in all age and size categories, while Turkish SMEs are more innovative in all age categories and only in small size segment. However, this research has not revealed any differences within the risk-taking behaviour of SMEs from different countries considering their size and age. The significant differences and similarities in EO of SMEs from different countries might stem from the educational status of the respondents, a considerable number of operating firms in a market, agility, flexibility, R&D activities and sector of firms. Financial, educational, administrative and legislative support needs to be given by policymakers to close the gap between EO of SMEs of different age, size, regions and countries.

TI  - The effects of mental budgeting and pain of payment on the financial decision making of socially excluded people
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose Consumers who experience social exclusion often prefer high-risk financial products over low-risk financial products. The aim of this study is to examine how this effect can be attenuated by applying the theories of mental budgeting and pain of payment. The authors' aim in pursuing this research is to improve the effectiveness of financial professionals and others in educating consumers on healthy financial practices. Understanding how social exclusion experiences influence financial decision-making is essential for continued progress in consumer financial education. Design/methodology/approach The authors examine the effect of consumers experiencing social exclusion on preference for high-risk financial products using an experimental design involving the manipulation of social exclusion/inclusion experiences. Data were collected from 148 consumers of mutual fund investment services via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Findings The study found that consumers experiencing social exclusion are more likely to make high risk investments. It also found that this effect is moderated by consumers' level of mental budgeting such that at high levels of mental budgeting the effect of social exclusion on investment choice is attenuated. The study further finds that the moderating effect of mental budgeting is mediated by pain of payment. Social implications The findings of this study suggest that policymakers can reduce unduly risky personal investment behavior by triggering mental budgeting thoughts using methods such as advertising and explicit mention of transaction fees. Originality/value The present study builds on existing research demonstrating the adverse behavioral consequences of social exclusion but refines our understanding by demonstrating the attenuating effect of mental budgeting and the mediating effect of pain of payment on high risk financial purchases.

TI  - Do cryptocurrency investors in the UK need more protection?
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE
AB  - PurposeThe existing literature offers various perspectives on integrating cryptocurrencies into investment portfolios; yet, there is a gap in understanding the behaviours, attitudes and cross-investment links of individual investors. This study, grounded in the modern portfolio theory and the random walk theory, aims to add empirical insights that are specific to the UK context. It explores four hypotheses related to the influence of socio-demographics, digital adoption, cross-investment behaviours and financial attitudes on cryptocurrency owners.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a logistic regression model with secondary data from the Financial Lives Survey 2020 to assess the factors impacting cryptocurrency ownership. A total of 29 variables are used, categorized into four groups aligned with the hypotheses. Additionally, hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted to further explore the cross-investment links.FindingsThe study reveals a significant lack of diversification among UK cryptocurrency investors, a pronounced inclination towards high-risk investments such as peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding, and parallels with gambling behaviours, including financial dissatisfaction and a propensity for risk-taking. It highlights the influence of demographic traits, risk tolerance, technological literacy and emotional attitudes on cryptocurrency investment decisions.Originality/valueThis study provides valuable insights into cryptocurrency regulation and retail investor protection, underscoring the necessity for tailored financial education and a holistic regulatory approach for investment products with comparable risk levels, with the aim of minimizing regulatory arbitrage. It significantly enhances our understanding of the unique dynamics of cryptocurrency investments within the evolving financial landscape.

TI  - Adoption of students' loan schemes: the contingent role of financial knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Purpose - Despite the introduction of structural reforms to the students' loan scheme (SLS) in Ghana's higher education sector, patronage is still low. This paper aims to examine the complexity of technological and behavioural factors underpinning the low rate of students' loan adoption in Ghana. It further contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring the moderating role of financial knowledge in the hypothesized relationships.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a positivistic research approach, a sample of 700 tertiary students with experience in accessing STSs were surveyed. An 88% response rate was realized and the data analysed using descriptive statistics, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.
   Findings - Four dimensions of technological factors (relative advantage, trialability, observability and compatibility) and two of behavioural factors (attitude and control behaviour) were positively related to adoption of the SLS. Financial knowledge only moderated the relationship between compatibility, attitude, behavioural control and students' loan adoption.
   Practical implications - Financial knowledge plays a critical role in influencing the investment decisions of people. Management of SLSs needs to offer financial education to targeted parents/students to clear misconceptions. It is also imperative that all other technical challenges are addressed to enhance adoption rates for the SLS. Review of guarantor requirements is needed also.
   Originality/value - This paper introduces financial knowledge as a moderating variable to investigate the hypothesized relationships. It offers a developing country insight into how technological/behavioural factors and financial knowledge might be impacting adoption of SLSs.

TI  - The direct and indirect effects of financial socialization and psychological characteristics on young professionals' personal financial management behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposePrior work expresses concern about young people's rising debt and lack of financial preparedness. This study focuses on how financial socialization and psychological characteristics affect the personal financial management behavior (PFMB) of young professionals in India. The authors examine both the direct effect of these factors and the indirect effects through financial literacy and aforementioned psychological characteristics as mediators.Design/methodology/approachThe authors develop a conceptual framework based on the extant literature and empirically test its hypotheses employing partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM).FindingsAttitude towards money, financial self-efficacy, financial risk tolerance, financial socialization through parental direct teaching and peers, and media are all positively associated with young professionals' PFMB, whereas external locus of control and procrastination are negatively associated with their PFMB. Almost all psychological characteristics partially mediate the association between financial socialization and PFMB. Finally, financial literacy plays a partially mediating role in the association between procrastination and PFMB as well as between financial socialization and PFMB.Practical implicationsThis study helps regulators and policymakers understand PFMB among young professionals. Interventions should build on the positive role of financial socialization, cultivating a good attitude towards money and financial self-efficacy, and reducing reliance on an external locus of control and procrastination. This study also helps policymakers and financial educators develop societally beneficial personal finance programs.Originality/valueThis research investigates social, psychological and cognitive characteristics in a comprehensive framework to further the authors' understanding of the topic of PFMB.

TI  - Shedding light on the impact of financial literacy for corporate social responsibility during the COVID-19 crisis: managerial and financial perspectives
T2  - MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB  - Purpose The aim of this paper is to help management scholars and executives learn from the COVID-19 global crisis by analyzing if and how the level of financial literacy affected stakeholders' sensitivity to corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues during the pandemic, as well as identifying whether financial literacy is an important variable to account for in the postpandemic period. The authors test the relationship between objective (measurable) and subjective (self-assessed) financial literacy, as well as financial happiness (i.e. satisfaction with one's current financial situation) with CSR during the pandemic. High levels of financial literacy cause individuals to reward companies that implement CSR strategies and processes. Design/methodology/approach The authors designed an online survey and obtained data on objective and subjective financial literacy, financial happiness and COVID-19 infections, as well as on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of a representative sample of 1,334 Italian respondents. From a methodological point of view, the authors perform a factor analysis on the CSR-related questions to extract the principal components (PCs) that were used as dependent variables in the regression models to analyze the effects of explanatory variables (financial literacy, financial happiness and COVID-19 infections) and consider the control variables (demographic and socioeconomic characteristics). The authors follow a theoretical approach merging stakeholder theory with CSR. Findings Respondents with a high level of financial literacy and financial happiness are highly sensitive to all CSR components (ethical, philanthropic, economic and legal social responsibilities). Being infected by COVID-19 increased participants' sensitivity to ethical and philanthropic social responsibility (SR), but not to economic and legal SR. The more educated and employed respondents were, the more sensitive they were to CSR, especially compared to their less educated and unemployed counterparts. Research limitations/implications While the sample used is large and representative of the Italian population, Italy is an interesting and useful case to analyze, given that it was the first Western country to be severely hit by COVID-19; since the paper only refers to a specific country scenario, the results cannot be generalized to other countries. A cross-country comparison relating financial literacy and financial happiness to CSR during the COVID-19 pandemic period would be desirable. The research study has theoretical implications for management scholars since the authors show that, during the pandemic period, financial education and financial happiness are relevant in explaining stakeholders' greater sensitivity to CSR issues. The findings may thus help scholars to learn from the COVID-19 period, with the aim of further developing and enhancing stakeholders' theory. Practical implications The research also has practical implications, both for corporate executives and for policymakers, helping them to learn from the COVID-19 global crisis concerning the role of financial literacy and financial happiness on CSR sensitivity and, consequently, how they may consider these important variables in the postpandemic era. On the one hand, executives may improve stakeholders' segmentation and eventually modify CSR policies, considering the higher sensitivity of their stakeholders' due to a higher degree of financial literacy.
   On the other hand, the findings suggest that policymakers should have a stronger role in supporting employment and education in general and in promoting programs to improve financial literacy to increase stakeholders' sensitivity to CSR, thus further stimulating the inclusion of CSR factors in companies' strategies. Increasing stakeholders' sensitivity to CSR will, in turn, increase the propensity of companies to include SR in their strategies. Thus, increasing financial literacy will have tangible positive effects of increasing CSR. Given the greater role played by companies during the COVID-19 period with respect to societal risk, the findings seem particularly useful. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first that links financial literacy and financial happiness with CSR during the COVID-19 crisis. The large and representative dataset, as well as the use of specific variables related to financial literacy, financial happiness and COVID-19 infections in the CSR assessment model, makes our analysis original, robust and significant by contributing to the CSR literature and to the financial literacy literature from a methodological point of view, as well as by informing corporate executives and policymakers about the role of financial literacy with regard to CSR during the pandemic, which may help them in learning how to improve their decisions and actions in the postpandemic era.

TI  - A new typology to characterize Italian digital entrepreneurs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR & RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose
   Strong agreement in the extant business literature emphasizes that digital developments are key to economic growth internationally. This is in spite of the recorded high levels (up to 50 percent) of failure among digital companies and entrepreneurs. The purpose of this paper is to identify the digital debates in Italy, explore current policies and develop a typology that characterizes digital entrepreneurs (DEs) and their start-up companies in Italy.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The digital debates and policies are explored through an extensive telephone survey of the self-perceptions and identified supports required by 348 Italian active DEs. Quantitative statistical techniques were used including factor analysis, cluster analysis and ANOVA, to identify motivations, profiles and critical success factors relevant to the sample.
   Findings
   The study identifies three main clusters among the DEs: emerging very young; emerging business focused and experienced. These clusters vary with the entrepreneurs' background and competence base, motivation and satisfaction factors. The different kinds of profiles require specific kinds of supporting policies identified by the sample that focus on financial, educational and/or networking provision.
   Originality/value
   The paper affirms the central role of digital entities in modern economies expressed in the current literature and increases knowledge of the perceived success factors identified by DEs. The identification and classification of self-reported characteristics of Italian DEs and to what extent these characterizations might be useful for tailored interventions to support their success are the main contributions of this study. Accordingly, an authentic, original and self-reported portrayal has been constructed of the self-perceptions of Italian DEs. Finally, the study explores the implications for actions and new policies considering self-perceived profiles, needs and expectations of DEs.

TI  - Financial Education versus Costly Counseling: How to Dissuade Borrowers from Choosing Risky Mortgages?
T2  - AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-ECONOMIC POLICY
AB  - This paper explores the effects of mandatory third-party review of mortgage contracts on consumer choice. The study is based on a legislative pilot carried out in Illinois in 2006, under which mortgage counseling was triggered by applicant credit scores or by their choice of "risky mortgages." Low-credit score applicants for whom counselor review was mandatory did not materially alter their contract choice. Conversely, higher credit score applicants who could avoid counseling by choosing nonrisky mortgages did so, decreasing their propensity for high-risk contracts between 10 and 40 percent. In the event, one of the key goals of the legislation-curtailment of high-risk mortgage products-was only achieved among the population that was not counseled.

TI  - Financial Well-Being Profile: An Empirical Study on Graduated Students
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The general stability of a person is related to financial well-being, and is reflected in their physical, financial, mental health, including being happier, more confident and more productive at work. The general purpose of this work is to evaluate if the mean of the results of financial well-being in graduates from the Veracruz-Boca del Rio conurbation differs from the value of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's average and to assess whether there are differences in the level of financial well-being through the characteristics of sex, career, institution and employment status. The research is quantitative and cross-sectional. The sample is made up of 50 graduates. For data collection, the Financial Well-Being Scale developed by the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) together with the participation of various experts and consumers, was used. The instrument consists of 10 items measured on a Likert scale. The first 6 items are designed to describe the financial situation of the individual, while the remaining 4 items measure the frequency with which individuals face certain situations. Since the results, we concluded that the graduates have a financial freedom reflecting a good financial education. This high percentage of subjects who have a medium to very high level generates that they have the ability to have good financial health that will allow them to deal with decisions in the financial area in their work environment. In addition, the results show that the level of financial well-being is not different among graduates according to age, marital status, employment status, career and institution.

TI  - Is It Necessary to Launch a School-Based Financial Literacy Curriculum? Evidence From China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - As starting university is a critical independence milestone for many young people, it would also be the best time to provide them with some financial education (FE). Although there have been many initiatives aimed at enhancing individual financial literacy (FL) and/or financial decision-making, meta-analyses have shown that the effectiveness of FE has been mixed. This study examined the driving forces behind the decision by college students to enroll in a targeted financial literacy curriculum (FLC) and the impact of this attendance on their FL. An endogenous switching model (ESM) was employed to account for the heterogeneity in the decision to attend or not attend the FLC and to counteract any unobservable characteristics. It was found that students with higher self-perceived FL did not prefer to attend the FLC; however, for others, FLC attendance was found to significantly boost their FL in areas such as financial knowledge (FK), financial attitude (FA), and financial behavior (FB), especially for the non-attendees under the counterfactual framework. These "non-attendees" were observed to have some characteristics (e.g., prior knowledge) that made them more financially literate regardless of attendance; however, if they had attended the FLC, they would have gained a greater FL than the attendees. As the FL of the attendees would have been much lower if they had not attended, the FLC appeared to be particularly important for the attendees, which strengthened the case for making the FLC a compulsory part of a general college education.

TI  - The Characteristics of the Financially Vulnerable Groups Impacted by COVID-19 and Other Factors
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Businesses have been exposed to various challenges during the global pandemic. Unfortunately, the financially vulnerable groups in society are disproportionately affected by such a difficult time. Therefore, it is important for businesses to recognise this when creating new business models for sustainable corporate management. This paper attempts to (1) identify the factors that affect individual financial vulnerability, (2) develop survey items to assess financial vulnerability and its factors and (3) provide the characteristics of financially vulnerable groups by presenting a complete set of descriptive statistics. The results can help to create more inclusive business models that are better equipped to address the challenges ahead. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted with collaboration with an NGO that provides a financial counselling service in Hong Kong. In total, 338 valid responses were collected and the data were used to characterise financially vulnerable groups in terms of (1) change in financial conditions due to COVID-19; (2) exposure to digitised financial services and related push marketing; (3) financial management ability; (4) changes in four financial behaviours and (5) financial vulnerability as measured according to the debt/service ratio. Results show that the respondents have a median debt/service ratio of 0.513, which represents an unsustainable level of debt. Around 1/4 of surveyed respondents reported that their debt/service ratio was 1 or even higher, indicating obvious difficulties in meeting financial obligations. A total of 36.7% of the respondents reported worsening financial conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19. The results presented provide a solid empirical set of data that will help future research work to examine and/or develop a heuristic financial vulnerability model that incorporates the key factors leading to it. Businesses can refer to them when creating new business models that are sustainable, able to meet corporate social responsibility goals and can achieve several targets/goals of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Financial Knowledge, Confidence, Credit Use, and Financial Satisfaction
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This article investigates associations between confidence about financial knowledge and two outcome variables, financial behaviors and financial satisfaction. On one hand, subjective financial knowledge (confidence) is necessary to make proactive decisions, yet overconfidence has been associated with a range of negative financial behaviors and outcomes. Both types of objective and subjective knowledge may be related to critical financial behaviors and choices such as credit card usage which in turn may be associated with financial satisfaction, an important component of consumer well-being. This article analyzes data from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study to examine how financial knowledge confidence relates to credit card behaviors and financial satisfaction. We use mediation and floodlight analyses to uncover relevant relationships between variables of interest. We find evidence that confidence is associated with healthy credit card use that contributes to financial satisfaction. We also observe strong interactions with knowledge to find that confidence is more strongly associated with credit card use and overall financial satisfaction as knowledge increases. Findings from this study can help financial educators and advisors to deliver the right mix of financial knowledge to better financial choices and behaviors.

TI  - Determinants of Financial Inclusion of Female Entrepreneurs in Somalia
T2  - GLOBAL SOCIAL WELFARE
AB  - Financial inclusion plays a crucial role in fostering business growth by facilitating the accumulation of capital and enabling access to investment opportunities for businesses over a period of time. This study aims to examine the financial inclusion of female entrepreneurs in Somalia. The determinants considered in this study are age, education, business longevity, the form of the business, and the type of the business. A cross-sectional research design was employed in this study to gather data from a sample of 385 female entrepreneurs situated in key urban centers within Somalia. The data collection process involved the administration of a structured questionnaire. Probit regression models were applied for analysis, and the study presents the marginal effect of each individual observation. According to the findings of this study, among the 385 female entrepreneurs surveyed, a notable proportion of 86% reported having a bank account. Additionally, approximately 59% of the participants stated that they saved money in a bank account. However, a relatively smaller percentage of 19% indicated they had received bank loans. Additionally, the study revealed that female entrepreneurs over 30 years are 4% more likely to have a bank account than their younger counterparts. However, young entrepreneurs are 2% more likely to save money in a bank account and 12% more likely to obtain a loan from a bank. Furthermore, the findings of this study indicate that the level of education plays a significant role in determining female financial inclusion. Specifically, female entrepreneurs with a university degree are 1% more likely to have a bank account, 6% more likely to save money in a bank account, and 12% more likely to borrow from a bank compared to those who had only completed secondary school or had not received formal education. This study\s policy implications emphasize the importance of promoting gender-inclusive financial policies, strengthening financial infrastructure, and providing financial education and entrepreneurial skills to create an enabling environment that fosters female entrepreneurs' financial inclusion and success in Somalia.

TI  - Clinically Competent and Fiscally at Risk: Impact of Debt and Financial Parameters on the Surgical Resident
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the costs of medical training continue to increase, surgeon income and personal financial decisions may be challenged to manage this expanding debt burden. We sought to characterize the financial liability, assets, income, and debt of surgical residents, and evaluate the necessity for additional financial training.
   STUDY DESIGN: All surgical trainees at a single academic center completed a detailed survey. Questions focused on issues related to debt, equity, cash flow, financial education, and fiscal parameters. Responses were used to calculate debt-to-asset and debt-to-income ratios. Predictors of moderate risk debt-to-asset ratio (0.5 to 0.9), high risk debt-to-asset ratio (>= 0.9), and high risk debt-to-income ratio (>0.4) were evaluated. All analyses were performed in SPSS v.21.
   RESULTS: One hundred five trainees completed the survey (80% response rate), with 38% of respondents reporting greater than $200,000 in educational debt. Overall, 82% of respondents had a moderate or high risk debt-to-asset ratio. Residency program, year, sex, and perception of financial knowledge did not correlate with high risk debt-to-asset ratio. Residents with high debt-to-asset ratios were more likely to have a high level of concern about debt (52% vs 0%, p < 0.001) when compared with residents who had low debt-to-asset ratios. The majority (79%) of respondents felt strongly that inclusion of additional financial training in residency education is a critical need.
   CONCLUSIONS: In a climate of increasingly delayed financial gratification, surgical trainees are on critically unstable financial footing. There is a major gap in current surgical education that requires reassessment for the long-term financial health of residents. (C) 2018 by the American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThe study focused on the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs at the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia, from 2019 to 2023.Design/methodology/approachThe design of the paper is empirical-analytical, focusing on the tangible and unique aspects of reality that can be fragmented for measurement. This approach privileges the use of data from the study population's experience, which is treated analytically through statistics to establish frequencies and correlations between variables. The research involved a structured questionnaire based on bibliographic references and considering the operational framework of the variables, which underwent expert review, necessary adjustments, a pilot test and subsequent validation in 2019 and 2023. The reliability of the instrument was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, ensuring a reliable indicator when equal to or greater than 0.7 in each analysis period. This methodology aimed to identify practices and how the financial profile influences short term.FindingsThe findings from the survey conducted with the microentrepreneurs at Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center reveal several significant connections to the theoretical framework. The study revealed that many microentrepreneurs relied on their personal funds for business financing, indicating a limited understanding of financial principles. Additionally, a significant portion of microentrepreneurs mitigated investment risk by securing loans from financial institutions, yet none utilized government subsidies like entrepreneurship loans, pointing to a lack of advice. The findings underscore the importance of financial education and suitable financial services for business development.Research limitations/implicationsOne limitation of this study is the lack of detailed data on the financial structure of microentrepreneurs' businesses, as well as specific information on interest rates and the terms and conditions of the microcredit used. These limitations may affect the generalization of the results and the comprehensive understanding of the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs. Future research could include a larger sample size and more accurate data on the financial structure of businesses, as well as a detailed investigation of interest rates and terms and conditions of microcredit, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the financial impacts for microentrepreneurs.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study have practical implications for microentrepreneurs in the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center. The research emphasizes the need for improved financial knowledge, accounting practices and debt management among microentrepreneurs. It also highlights the importance of financial education and access to suitable financial services for business development. The study's insights can guide the development of training programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing financial literacy and financial management among microentrepreneurs, leading to more informed decision-making and improved financial outcomes.Social implicationsFrom a social perspective, this research contributes to promoting economic development and financial inclusion. By addressing the mismanagement of microcredit by microentrepreneurs and providing insights into their short-term finances, the study aims to foster economic empowerment and sustainable development within communities.
   The findings underscore the significance of microfinance in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. The research emphasizes the importance of equitable access to financial services, which can contribute to narrowing the gap between the financially excluded population and the conventional financial system.Originality/valueThis research adds originality and value to the academic community by addressing the incidence of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs in the specific context of the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia. By characterizing the financial profile of microentrepreneurs, establishing the relationship between microcredit characteristics and the financial profile and proposing an action plan, the study provides valuable insights for decision-making in both the academic and microfinance fields. The research contributes to the existing literature on microfinance and financial inclusion, offering a unique perspective and potential solutions for optimizing the use of microcredit-funded resources by microentrepreneurs.

TI  - Advisors for micro-entrepreneurs: is one as good as another in accessing alternative finance?
T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - Using a novel large database of Italian micro-entrepreneurs, we investigate how different sources of external business advice affect access to alternative finance. We distinguish three categories of external business advice: professional financial, professional non-financial, and non-professional. We also test whether financial knowledge of micro-entrepreneurs enhances their advice seeking for financial decision-making. We find that the use of alternative financial instruments increases when external business advisors are used, but some are more useful than others. Only professional financial advice is shown to increase the probability of accessing alternative finance by micro-enterprises, while non-professional and professional non-financial advice does not have the same effect. We also find that being more financially literate increases the probability that micro-entrepreneurs seek advice from highly professional sources, i.e., objective financial knowledge helps shape the quality of financial advice requested.
   Do external business advisors help micro-entrepreneurs access alternative finance? Yes, they do. But only if they are professional financial advisors. Focusing on Italy, where 90-95% of all SMEs are micro-SME, as in the most of EU-27 Member States, our paper demonstrates that the source of advice matters to access alternative finance. We distinguish three categories of external business advice: professional financial (financial intermediaries and external financial consultants), professional non-financial (external accountants and public institutions), and non-professional (relatives, friends, and business partners). Only professional financial advisors increase the probability of using alternative financial instruments by micro-enterprises, while non-professional and professional non-financial advisors do not. This implies that micro-entrepreneurs, to diversify their sources of funding, should overcome their concerns related to the value and expense of specialized financial advisory services and improve their use. Moreover, our paper shows that being more financially literate increases the probability that micro-entrepreneurs seek advice from highly professional sources. From a policy perspective, this implies that governments should encourage and support the use of business professional financial advisors among micro-entrepreneurs, both directly by giving tax advantages to financial advisory services, and indirectly by strengthening financial education programs targeting micro-entrepreneurs.

TI  - The impact of financial literacy on negotiation behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This research investigates the role of financial literacy on initiating and achieving a favorable negotiation outcome in an employment context. With a goal of improving long-term financial well-being, extant research examines whether increasing a person's understanding of basic financial concepts ("financial literacy") improves his/her financial decision-making. The current research proposes broader effects of financial literacy via negotiation behavior. We follow prior research to measure financial literacy both objectively (as the accurate assessment of basic financial concepts, "financial knowledge") and subjectively (as confidence in the application of basic financial skills and concepts, "financial confidence"). In a series of studies engaging students from undergraduate business courses and adults recruited from an online crowdsourcing service, this research examines the relationship between these measures of financial literacy and (a) the likelihood of initiating a negotiation and (b) the likely outcome from a negotiation, if initiated. Results suggest that financial confidence impacts participants' willingness to engage in negotiation, while financial knowledge impacts the level of participants' first offer. These findings suggest financial literacy has important implications for career advancement and compensation, as well as the successful management of interpersonal communications, even in fields not traditionally thought of as focusing on numerical reasoning skills.

TI  - Religiosity-based behavioral study, Islamic finance users' approach and selection standard: empirical evidence from Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeConsidering the speedy growth of Islamic finance and limited research work on Muslim behavior regarding Islamic Banking, this study aims to investigate to comprehend the stimulus of religiosity on customer's behavior.Design/methodology/approachA conceptual model is developed on existing literature. The key dimensions of religiosity in the model include practice, knowledge, experience and consequences to capture the whole religiosity of customers. Model of the study investigates the impact of customer's religiosity on their behavior in decision-making about selection of Islamic bank. Analysis of the study is based on the sample of 370 customers of Islamic banks from District Nowshera Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The data for the study collected through random sampling by a comprehensive survey questionnaire. Binary logistic model is used to test the data for statistical analysis.FindingsThe key findings of the study suggest that religiosity influence customer behavior positively in decision-making regarding Islamic finance. Service standards of Islamic banking has also significant impact on customer perception, while the financial education of the customers has insignificant impact on customer behavior.Research limitations/implicationsThis study mainly focused on the curiosity of the customer religious commitment, so religiosity is a vast phenomenon; there are deep sections in each dimension of religiosity, so further study is suggested for the comprehensive capture of each dimension of religiosity.Practical implicationsThe results of the study have a great importance for the managers of Islamic finance industry to identify and detect the potential customers and divide the target market of banking industry on the base of religiosity. Furthermore, the study may bring significant managerial suggestions for marketing planners and can help them in market segmentation strategies.Originality/valueThe study examined the association between Muslim religiosity and Islamic banking customer's selection behavior. This study spread the understanding of religiosity and its impact on Islamic banking customer's behavior. Furthermore, the study is valuable to discover the level to which religiosity determines the inclinations of customers. This study helps marketing practitioners and researchers to grow their knowledge about customer's motives in terms of religious commitment.

TI  - What restricts SMEs from adopting sophisticated capital budgeting practices?
T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - Plain English Summary Capital budgeting is a financial management instrument that evaluates potential investment alternatives and decides which investment project will benefit the firm most. It deals with large long-term funds and their allocations. Despite its prominence, studies report that small and medium enterprises do not practice capital budgeting. This study explores the barriers faced by small and medium enterprises towards the use of capital budgeting while making their long-term investment decisions. The study finds that the lack of financial knowledge and training of the decision-maker and the complexity, calculation difficulty, and time associated with the capital budgeting techniques are the biggest impediments to the practice of capital budgeting among small firms.
   The lack of robust financial management is an integral growth constraint faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). For the sustainability and growth of SMEs, it is vital to choose the correct long-term projects. Yet, literature shows that SMEs across the globe hardly practice the sophisticated capital budgeting (CB) method. The present study identifies, prioritizes, and proposes a structural model of the barriers to CB practices. The study adopts an integrated method combining the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (F-AHP) and the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL) approach to evaluate the barriers to CB practices among SMEs in India. The prioritization obtained through the F-AHP suggests that the knowledge barrier of the decision-makers and the inherent barrier associated with the CB techniques are the most weighted main barriers impeding the practice of CB among SMEs. Also, the most important sub-barriers are time consumption and high complexity of the methods, lack of financial education and training of decision-makers, and lack of computation technology. F-DEMATEL provides a reliable quantitative measure of the association of the barriers to implementing sophisticated CB practices among SMEs. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to identify, prioritize, and structure the barriers to CB practices. Also, it is the first to apply multi-criteria decision-making tools in this field of research. Our findings can help financial managers/practitioners of SMEs to formulate sophisticated CB techniques in their investment decision strategies and efficiently manage their long-term funds.

TI  - Augmented reality (AR)-based sharia financial literacy system (AR-SFLS): a new approach to virtual sharia financial socialization for young learners
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose This study aims to examine financial socialization based on augmented reality (AR) technology for elementary school students, which it is hoped will improve their sharia financial knowledge. Design/methodology/approach The experimental method with pre- and post-test and control groups was used to test the improvement in the young learners' sharia financial knowledge. This study used AR for sharia financial socialization on elementary school students and focused on sharia's basic concepts, which include earning money, balanced spending, borrowing, saving, investment, payment methods, financial technology and the concept of protection. Findings This study finds empirical evidence that the treatment group, who received sharia financial socialization via the AR media, increased their sharia financial knowledge to a greater extent than the control group did. Research limitations/implications This study provides encouraging evidence about the potential of sharia financial education for elementary school students using the appropriate learning strategies and media. The weakness in this study is that it was only carried out in one elementary school, with the children of middle- to upper-income parents. Further research should be undertaken at several schools with the children of parents with different income levels. Practical implications A shift in learning styles from verbal or visual to virtual encourages the use of AR-based learning media. Financial concepts can be abstract ones, and AR-based learning media is able to present intangible virtual elements so they become more concrete and tangible. Social implications The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects. One of the most severe and likely to be multiyear ahead is the financial aspect. Therefore, this research is expected to be a preparation for the younger generation as early as possible to strengthen social benefits in order to improve sharia financial literacy. Originality/value Research into the financial literacy, especially sharia financial literacy aimed at elementary school students, is still very limited. The teaching of financial literacy will be more effective if educators use the appropriate strategies and media. This study used financial socialization strategies and AR learning media that are aligned with the learning styles of young learners.

TI  - Financial literacy and its determinants: the case of rural farm households in Ghana
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the determinants of rural dwellers financial literacy in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional primary data set was used to estimate the factors influencing rural farm households' financial literacy using the IV-Tobit model. Findings The findings reveal that most rural residents are financially illiterate. The econometrics model results depicted that respondents' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as gender, income, age and education significantly affect financial literacy. Again, respondents who are risk seekers and listen or watch education programs are more likely to be financially literate. Research limitations/implications The paper examined the determinants of rural dwellers financial literacy in four regions in Ghana. Future research should consider all or many regions for an informed generalization of findings. Practical implications This paper provides evidence that rural dwellers are financially illiterate and it would require the policymakers or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to establish a village or community group that comprises a wide range of bankers and government officials to help rural dwellers acquire some financial skills. Also, the positive relationship between media (whether respondent watches or listens to educational programs) and financial literacy implies that policymakers should focus on improving individuals' financial knowledge through training programs and utilize the media as a channel to propagate financial education to the public. Originality/value Although previous studies have examined the determinants of financial literacy, little is known in developing countries and, in particular, rural communities. The authors fill this gap by contributing to the scanty existing literature in developing countries in several ways. First, this is the first study to examine the financial literacy level of rural dwellers in Ghana. Second, to not undermine the credibility of the estimation results, this study addresses the potential endogeneity issue, which other researchers have not adequately recognized. Finally, the study expands the scant literature on the subject and provides critical policy implications that will help policymakers formulate financial market policies that will contribute to rural dwellers financial literacy enhancement.

TI  - Meta-evaluation of a whole systems programme, ActEarly: A study protocol
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - IntroductionLiving in an area with high levels of child poverty predisposes children to poorer mental and physical health. ActEarly is a 5-year research programme that comprises a large number of interventions (>20) with citizen science and co-production embedded. It aims to improve the health and well-being of children and families living in two areas of the UK with high levels of deprivation; Bradford in West Yorkshire, and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. This protocol outlines the meta-evaluation (an evaluation of evaluations) of the ActEarly programme from a systems perspective, where individual interventions are viewed as events in the wider policy system across the two geographical areas. It includes investigating the programme's impact on early life health and well-being outcomes, interdisciplinary prevention research collaboration and capacity building, and local and national decision making. MethodsThe ActEarly meta-evaluation will follow and adapt the five iterative stages of the 'Evaluation of Programmes in Complex Adaptive Systems' (ENCOMPASS) framework for evaluation of public health programmes in complex adaptive systems. Theory-based and mixed-methods approaches will be used to investigate the fidelity of the ActEarly research programme, and whether, why and how ActEarly contributes to changes in the policy system, and whether alternative explanations can be ruled out. Ripple effects and systems mapping will be used to explore the relationships between interventions and their outcomes, and the degree to which the ActEarly programme encouraged interdisciplinary and prevention research collaboration as intended. A computer simulation model ("LifeSim") will also be used to evaluate the scale of the potential long-term benefits of cross-sectoral action to tackle the financial, educational and health disadvantages faced by children in Bradford and Tower Hamlets. Together, these approaches will be used to evaluate ActEarly's dynamic programme outputs at different system levels and measure the programme's system changes on early life health and well-being. DiscussionThis meta-evaluation protocol presents our plans for using and adapting the ENCOMPASS framework to evaluate the system-wide impact of the early life health and well-being programme, ActEarly. Due to the collaborative and non-linear nature of the work, we reserve the option to change and query some of our evaluation choices based on the feedback we receive from stakeholders to ensure that our evaluation remains relevant and fit for purpose.

TI  - The Historical Record on Active versus Passive Mutual Fund Performance
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTING
AB  - This study examines the risk-adjusted performance of actively managed mutual funds versus passively managed mutual funds between 1991 and 2019 and finds that there is no statistically significant difference in performance between the two types of funds when the passively managed funds are compared to competitively priced actively managed funds. The practical implication of this study is that, setting tax considerations aside, as long as investors are cost-conscious in their fund selection process, investing in passively managed funds does not meaningfully improve investor outcomes.

TI  - A Study on Financial Literacy among University Students
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The rapid development in the financial markets has led to the arrival of innovative financial products and services in the market. The consumer is often in a dilemma about which financial product to choose from. Financial ignorance leads to wrong financial decisions which hamper the path to achieving holistic well-being. Financial literacy is the key requirement to make an optimal financial decision. It helps to better understand the financial initiatives of the government. Possessing financial literacy is a must skill for individuals from various domains. The core of that domain is students. They are the cornerstone of the future. While pursuing their higher education, students face numerous obstacles. They frequently struggle with time management, health, stress while trying to achieve good academic grades, and money management, along with other things. Their primary source of revenue at this crucial stage is their part-time employment or pocket money. Equipping them with smart money management skills helps them to balance their finances and academics. Financial literacy helps to achieve financial well-being which helps to reduce financial stress. An attempt is made to study financial literacy and the various socio-demographic factors affecting financial literacy among students pursuing graduation and post-graduation in Commerce from Punjabi University, Patiala. This has been highlighted in various studies that the students from the financial domain have an edge in financial concepts over students from other disciplines. The (Rooij, Lusardi, &Alessie, 2007) questionnaire based on Basic and Sophisticated Financial Literacy was used to assess financial literacy. The research relied on first-hand data gathered from 300 university students. The data was evaluated using percentage analysis, the T-test, and one-way ANOVA. The study highlighted that the mean percentage of financial literacy among students is 65.83 which is an indicator of good financial literacy.56% of university students have a good level of financial knowledge. The investigation of financial literacy across demographics revealed that female students have lower financial literacy than male students. The studies conducted by various organisations like the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and National Centre for Financial Education in India also expressed their concern about lower financial literacy among women in their studies. The T-Test findings revealed that gender and education level make a substantial difference in financial literacy levels, however residential area has no impact on financial literacy levels. The One Way ANOVA findings showed that parental qualification had no effect on students' financial literacy. This study will add more aspects to previous studies on financial literacy. Despite, studying the same curriculum why female students are still lagging in financial literacy? It will help the policymakers to frame the policies that are conducive to enhancing the financial literacy among female students. Educational institutions must focus on the practicality of the curriculum with enhanced exposure to financial terms. Early the inculcation of financial skills, the better will the financial foundation of individuals.

TI  - A review on American senior housing and financing decisions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB  - PurposeThe world population is getting older and housing decisions matter to the security of retirement life and well-being. However, senior housing and financing decisions are largely overlooked in the literature. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the senior housing and financing decisions in the USA.Design/methodology/approachUsing 2021 American Housing Survey data and ordinary least squares estimates, this paper studies senior housing and financing decisions in the 15 most populous US metropolitan areas. Multiple regressions are used to analyze the whole sample as well as various subsamples.FindingsThis paper finds strong evidence that seniors are more likely to own a house with a higher market value compared with nonseniors. More specifically, although race and gender do not matter in this relationship, it is less pronounced among those with higher education. Also, seniors, especially white senior homeowners, are more likely to have a lower mortgage debt burden due to a higher upfront down payment than nonseniors. Last, seniors are more likely to refinance their homes and receive cash than nonseniors.Research limitations/implicationsConstrained by the data limitations, this study specifically focuses on seniors' housing and mortgage decisions. Future research could involve exploring seniors' mortgage decisions by considering factors such as mortgage loan terms, borrower credentials and the evolving landscape of the senior housing market, among other aspects.Practical implicationsThe findings would help policymakers and contractors in the construction industry better understand the uniqueness of challenges in the senior housing market and develop effective housing policies and programs that cater to the needs of the elderly. A comprehensive understanding of the senior housing market would also help seniors make informed purchase and financing decisions.Social implicationsThe authors propose providing financial education to the elderly, particularly those of disadvantaged status, to improve their expertise and bargaining skills in the mortgage loan application process.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to understanding the dynamic senior housing market, which encounters challenges and opportunities associated with the aging population. The study fills the gap of limited research regarding seniors' housing decision and their financing choices in the USA and would help policymakers and contractors in the construction industry develop effective housing policies and programs that cater to the needs of the elderly.

TI  - HOW DO SAVINGS AND PERSONAL BUDGETING MATTER ON FINANCIAL LITERACY AND WELL-BEING
T2  - BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS ENGINEERING
AB  - Purpose - the well-being of individuals plays a vital role in fostering sustainable economic development. The differentiation between subjective and objective well-being in selected EU and selected non-EU countries, with a particular focus on financial literacy, as individuals' assessments of their own well-being can significantly differ from objective economic indicators, emphasizing the subjective nature of well-being. The research objective is to investigate how savings and personal budgeting indicators affect both objective and sub-jective well-being and to examine the role of these indicators in promoting financial literacy. Research methodology - the research investigates the impact of savings and personal budget-ing indicators on financial literacy (FLI), financial well-being (FWB), and gross domestic prod-uct at purchasing power parity per capita (GDP PPP per capita). We applied Pearson's pairwise correlation between nine indicators of personal budgeting and savings and the method of principal components to identify the reasonable factors according to their statistical significance based on data from 22 countries included in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development/International Network on Financial Education (OECD/INFE) survey data, Global Findex Database. The application of the Varimax procedure made it possible to identify factor groups of indicators. Findings - we identify two factors for the whole sample and a sample of selected EU-countries; for non-EU-countries were identified three factors. Our research reveals that subjective FWB across all countries and non-EU countries is under the significant influence of factor group 1 mainly represented by savings indicators, with no significance for EU countries. FLI also significantly depends on factor group 1 for the entire sample of countries and across EU and non-EU countries. GDP PPP per capita is under the significant influence of all factors both in the sample of countries and across EU and non-EU countries. Research limitations - FLI databases started to be gathered relatively recently and are not regularly updated. This can cause a situation when data for different countries are provided with time gaps. Moreover, due to the high cost involved, not all countries conduct such re-search, which hinders the creation of large datasets for more accurate country comparisons. Practical implications - the results of this study may have interest for policymakers since they focus on improvement of the financial literacy and FWB of individuals, that results in a higher level of financial stability. Originality/Value - this research is to address existing gaps in understanding of the interplay between subjective and objective FWB. Also, it proposes a novel approach that views savings as a factor that enhances financial literacy, in contrast to the conventional approach that con -siders savings as a consequence of improved FWB.

TI  - Financial literacy and financial behaviour: a bibliometric analysis
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose Numerous exploratory, conceptual and empirical enquiries on financial behaviour and literacy have been conducted in the areas of economics, finance, business and management. However, no attempt was made to present a comprehensive science mapping of the area so far. Hence, the study intends to elicit the trend in the research field through synthesis of knowledge structures. Design/methodology/approach Bibliometric analysis in the field of financial literacy and financial behaviour was performed on a sample of 1,138 documents based on a scientific search strategy run on the Web of Science database for the period 1985-2020. Biblioshiny, which is a web-based application included in Bibliometrix package developed in R-language (Ariaa and Cuccurullo, 2017), was used for the study. With the help of automated workflow in the software, prominent journals, authors, countries, articles, themes were identified; and citation, co-citation and social network analysis were conducted. Findings Results show that the themes of financial literacy and financial behaviour have evolved over a period of time as an interdisciplinary field. In the initial stages, researchers focused on demographic and socio-economic determinants, but gradually the field embraced topics like behavioural and psychological constructs influencing financial behaviour. Along with conceptual structure, this research reveals the intellectual and social structure of the domain. This study provides important insights on areas that need further investigation. Research limitations/implications The current research is a bibliometric analysis and hence limitations related to such studies are applicable. For future researchers to derive a strong conceptual framework, a systematic review of literature would be helpful. Science mapping for this study is limited to the Web of Science database owing to its wider coverage of good quality journals, structured formats which are compatible with the Bibliometrix software. Practical implications The current study provides important insights on financial literacy and financial behaviour and their inter-linkages. It highlights the most addressed issues in the area and leads towards the prospective areas for research. It informs the future researchers about the emergent themes, contexts and possibilities of collaborations in this area by revealing social and intellectual structure of the domain. Social implications The paper can provide important insights for policy formulation in the areas of financial education and literacy. Originality/value There has been lot of conceptual and empirical work done in the past, across countries, spanning the disciplines such as economics, finance, psychology and consumer behaviour. A major contribution of this study is that it consolidates fragmented literature in the area, highlights significant sources, authors and documents, while exploring the relation between financial literacy and financial behaviour.

TI  - Changing Gambling Behavior through Experiential Learning
T2  - WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - This paper tests experiential learning as a debiasing tool to reduce gambling in South Africa, through a randomized field experiment. The study implements a simple, interactive game that simulates the odds of winning the national lottery through dice rolling. Participants first roll one die until they obtain a six, followed by two dice until they roll 2 sixes. They are then informed that the probability of winning the lottery jackpot is equivalent to rolling all sixes with nine dice. The results show that individuals who need many attempts to roll 2 sixes play the lottery significantly less than the control group, while those who need fewer attempts adopt the opposite behavior. These findings provide practical guidance for designing interventions to give individuals brief experiences that correct biases in their beliefs.

TI  - To trust is good, but to control is better: How investors discipline financial advisors' activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Using a survey of clients from one of the largest Italian banks, we find that investors with low level of trust in professional advisors seek financial counselling, but make their decisions autonomously. We investigate whether these investors exert some form of control over the recommendations they receive, and, if so, which one. Investors can push advisors to provide better recommendations either by asking for a second expert's opinion, such as in the case of credence services, or by monitoring closely the advisor's activity themselves. We find that three quarters of investors do not exert any control on advisors. Different types of financial competence-self-assessed or test-based-serve different purposes. The investors featuring higher self-assessed financial competence are more likely to control the advisor's activity. The mechanism through which investors exert control over the advisors' activity depends instead on the investors' degree of test-based financial literacy. Investors with high financial literacy directly monitor the advisors' activity. Investors with low financial literacy are more likely to seek a second professional opinion in support of the recommendations previously received. Our findings suggest that improving investors financial knowledge may foster direct control of the advisor's activity. Moreover, facilitating the comparison between financial products by standardized and centralized information may be very effective to protect poorly literate investors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Precautionary savings, retirement planning and misperceptions of financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We measure financial literacy among Linkedln members, complementing standard questions with additional questions that allow us to gauge self-perceptions of financial literacy. Average financial literacy is surprisingly low given the demographics of our sample: fewer than two-thirds of chief financial officers, chief executive officers, and chief operating officers complete the test correctly. Financial literacy, precautionary savings and retirement planning are positively correlated, but this is mostly driven by perceived, not actual, literacy: controlling for self-perceptions, actual literacy has low predictive power. Perceptions drive decision-making among low-literacy respondents and are associated with mistaken beliefs about financial products and less willingness to accept financial advice.

TI  - How Confident Are Personal Finance Teachers? A Survey of High School Instructors in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - Nonprofit organizations and regional universities have increasingly offered professional development opportunities for potential personal finance teachers as states and school districts have increasingly required high school students to take personal finance courses. Yet, current measures on teacher confidence and dispositions shadow these updates. This article employs unique data on high school teachers to estimate their confidence levels, professional development take-up, and attitudes about teaching personal finance courses in schools. The results show that 95% of teachers are confident in teaching personal finance. Teachers with licensure outside of business or economics were more likely to take up professional development in personal finance instruction. Meanwhile, 86% of teachers support a graduation requirement for personal finance instruction in high school. These findings suggest that high schools have the capacity to teach personal finance but also underscore the need for low-cost, easily accessible professional development opportunities.

TI  - Financial education is more precious than money - examining the role of financial literacy in enhancing financial wellbeing among Saudi women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
AB  - The study explores the role of financial literacy, financial socialisation, and certain demographic characteristics (such as income, education, father's education and mother's education) in enhancing financial wellbeing through developing/promoting financial self-efficacy and financial coping behaviours, among Saudi women. There is sparse research evidence available in the literature that examines the levels of financial literacy among Saudi women and how it contributes to their financial wellbeing and the related financial behaviours, this paper therefore, provides important evidence to bridge this important research gap. Based on PLS-based path modelling performed over a set of 1,338 responses from Saudi women, we found a significant positive effect of both the antecedents (i.e., financial literacy and the financial socialisation) on financial wellbeing mediated through financial self-efficacy and (financial) coping behaviours. Similarly, demographic characteristics including women respondents' income, education, father's education, and mother's education are partially positively related to financial self-efficacy as well as the financial coping behaviour. However, demographic characteristics were not seen to be significantly related to financial wellbeing. Besides bridging significant research gaps in the literature, this study provides practical implications for Saudi women to enhance their financial wellbeing through enhancing financial literacy and financial socialisation.

TI  - Debt and Financial Vulnerability on the Verge of Retirement
T2  - JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING
AB  - We analyze older individuals' debt and financial vulnerability using data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the National Financial Capability Study (NFCS). In the HRS, we compare three groups of people age 56-61 in 1992, 2004, and 2010, to assess cross-cohort changes in debt over time. Two waves of the NFCS (2012 and 2015) provide additional insights into debt management and older individuals' capacity to shield themselves against shocks. We conclude that recent cohorts hold more debt and face more financial insecurity than in the past. This will render them particularly vulnerable to forecasted interest rate increases.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR BUSINESS
AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has given rise to sophisticated language models that excel in understanding and generating human-like text. With the capacity to process vast amounts of information, these models effectively tackle problems across diverse domains. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of prominent AI language models-ChatGPT and Google Bard-focusing on their ability to solve undergraduate finance problems. We find that GPT-4 significantly outperforms Bard-1.0, excelling in easy problems but struggling with complex ones. The results suggest that it is crucial to handle AI with care in order to uphold academic integrity.

TI  - Challenges of financial inclusion policies in Peru
T2  - REVISTA FINANZAS Y POLITICA ECONOMICA
AB  - The purpose of the research is to identify the main determinants of financial inclusion in Peru at the department level (without Lima) from 2010 to 2017, aiming to analyze the challenges faced by financial inclusion policies. A two-stage GMM method was used to estimate a panel data model where the endogenous variable is Sarma's financial inclusion index (2008). The results indicate that bank concentration is the main variable affecting financial inclusion. At the same time, although the effect of technology is positive, it is diminishing over time due to the inefficient deployment of such technology and, in many cases, a lack of knowledge on how to use it, especially in the remote areas of Peru.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY OF STUDENTS IN CHOSEN UNIVERSITIES - RESEARCH PLATFORM FOR REGULATORY PROCESSES OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN SLOVAKIA
T2  - E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT
AB  - The main goal of this paper is to compare the level of financial literacy among the selected faculties of economics in Slovakia and to elaborate a comparison of financial literacy level at both input and output level, i.e. between the university students at the beginning of their Bachelor study and the university students who are in the final stage of their Master study. In addition, we want to analyze the level of financial literacy by means of practical tasks aimed at confirmation or rejection of the prospect theory principles. Concerning methods we statistically process our primary data which were collected through the survey 2015/2016 from Slovak University of economics in Kosice, Presov and Bratislava. Inter alia, we analyze correlative data dependence of selected variables. The survey is focused also on financial behavior of respondents and their skills in terms of financial literacy concept. Last but not least, we deal with features of respondents' financial decision making under the conditions of risk and uncertainty. At first, we show that statistically significant dependency of FL level on respondents' sex does exist. Male respondents reached higher FL than female ones. Hypothesis of better high school education of economy at Business Secondary School was rejected, rate of financially literate respondents who attended Grammar School or Business Secondary School is comparable. Subsequently, students in their last year of studies at EKF TUKE and NHF EUBA have significantly higher level of FL than those students who are at the beginning of their studies. Contrary, at FM PU the rate of financially illiterate first-year students was lower than the rate of financially literate students in their last year of studies. We found out a correlation of FL with decision-making based on prospect theory. The results of the presented research provide important information for policy makers who should reflect on present status of this issue in Slovakia.

TI  - Financial literacy among university students: A study in eight European countries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - This study analysed the level of financial literacy among university students in Estonia, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation and Turkey. The purpose of the study was to determine the level of financial literacy among university students, and to find out the relationship between financial knowledge and demographic characteristics of students. Online survey instrument was used to collect data. 409 fully completed questionnaires were accepted for analysis. Logistic regression was used to analyse of impact of the demographic characteristics on financial literacy. Overall mean of correct answers for the survey was 72.2%. This result represents a medium level of financial literacy about personal finance. Results indicate that male students, business major students, PhD students, those who live in a rental house, those whose parents have high level income, those who get advice on financial matters from their friends, those who took financial course before, those who get financial information about financial issues from university education, and students from Poland are more knowledgeable on personal finance. More financial courses should be provided in university education programmes, which could help more students handle their finances better and improve their financial wellbeing. It should be taken into consideration that in recent years, environmental and technological influences on financial literacy may be more important than parental influence.

TI  - Extending financial literacy to insurance literacy: a survey approach
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - We extend behavioural research in investment and retirement savings to insurance, by investigating factors that may influence individuals' insurance decision making. These factors include financial literacy, specialist insurance education and some behavioural biases. Based on a definition of insurance literacy that requires both having, and applying insurance knowledge, we find from a survey of postgraduate students that financial literacy does not necessarily translate to insurance literacy, whereas more specialised education can improve insurance literacy. Results also indicate specialist education potentially reduces susceptibility to anchoring effects.

TI  - Business schools, the anxiety of finance, and the order of the 'middle tier'
T2  - JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY
AB  - Financial imagination plays a fundamental, yet ambivalent role in the establishment of hierarchies within and between business schools, and in business life at large. This study examines this process in the 'middle tier' of business education: that is, in the social space in which students and instructors understand themselves to occupy a 'mid-range' position within an order of excellence and success. Largely articulated through business school rankings, this order strongly relies on the centrality of the financial curriculum, proficiency in which is understood as both a proxy for smartness and a sign of moneymaking capacity. In the 'middle tier', this order manifests in the form of an anxiety: an order that, though legitimate, is thought not to be attained, or hardly attainable. The study draws from ethnographic investigation in a 'middle tier' business school with attention to how finance is made sense of in relation to an alternative curriculum, and in connection with the aim of 'making it to the top'. A comparison with a 'top tier' business school allows furthering understanding of how the order of business schools relies on the anxiety of finance in order to reproduce an acquiescence to dominant financial imagination.

TI  - Impact of gamification on mitigating behavioral biases of investors
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - We investigate whether gamification can help mitigate behavioral biases of investors by conducting a unique stock market experiment that is free from observer-expectancy and subject-expectancy effects. Utilizing the trading data of investors who simultaneously have active portfolios in an investment firm and stock market simulation game, we show that investors have different biases in real versus simulated settings. We find that participating in a stock market game affects all biases differently, with different degrees of participation to the game. While overconfidence bias and disposition effect can be mitigated and decrease with more active participation in the game, familiarity and status quo biases increase. We also show that young, inexperienced investors with average-sized portfolios and men are more likely to participate. These findings will especially be of interest to researchers, financial institutions and governmental bodies that plan to conduct similar experiments and design services promoting better financial decision-making and investment behavior.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Financial knowledge of university students in Korea and Germany
T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB  - This study compares the financial knowledge of Korean (N = 1006) and German (N = 1346) university students. The country-specific adaptations of the US-American Test of Financial Literacy was used to assess financial knowledge. Financial knowledge can be divided into three areas (everyday money management; banking; insurance). German students show a slightly higher knowledge of everyday money management and insurance. Korean students tend to be stronger in the area banking. The paper examines the impact of gender on financial knowledge and the role of financial information gathering. A gender difference is determined in Germany, but not in Korea. Male students in Germany score higher than female students. An analysis of variance shows that Korean as well as German students who inform themselves more frequently about financial topics achieve a higher financial knowledge score. The article shows that it is possible to validly measure financial knowledge in Germany and Korea, which have different economic systems.

TI  - The impact of mortgage broker use on borrower confusion and preferences
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - We examine how mortgage brokers affect borrower confusion about key mortgage features and assess whether brokers mitigate confusion by educating borrowers. Drawing from two lab -in -the -field experiments, we first show a correlation between the attributes borrowers find most confusing and those they find least important. Second, we show that borrowers who secure loans directly from lenders demonstrate lower confusion levels compared to those using brokers, even after accounting for self-selection bias. Despite this, broker users exhibit higher decision satisfaction and confidence after taking a loan. Third, using responses from discrete choice experiments to implement a causal mediation analysis with a single IV, we evaluate the influence of broker use, financial literacy, and subjective confusion on borrowers' willingness to pay for specific mortgage attributes. Our findings reveal that broker users are willing to pay more for attributes that increase the value and duration of loans, increasing broker commissions.

TI  - Medicaid and Long-Term Care: The Effects of Penalizing Strategic Asset Transfers
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND INSURANCE
AB  - Medicaid provides a critical source of insurance for long-term care, and individuals may strategically offload assets (typically to children) to meet the means-tested eligibility requirement. In this article, we quantify the extent of such behavior using variation in the penalty for improper parent-to-child transfers induced by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. We estimate difference-in-differences models based on the hypothesis that only individuals with high levels of nursing home risk (high risk) will alter transfers because of the Act. We find that over a 2-year horizon, high-risk individuals reduced transfers to children on the extensive margin by 11 percent and that the average total amount of transfers decreased by $4,860. The results hold only for coupled respondents. We also conduct a triple-differences analysis to examine heterogeneity with financial literacy and find that even those with a low level of financial literacy responded to the penalty.

TI  - Aspirations and financial decisions: Experimental evidence from the Philippines
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - A randomized experiment among poor entrepreneurs tested the impact of exogenously inducing higher financial aspirations. In theory, raising aspirations could have positive effects by inducing higher effort, but could also reduce effort if unmet aspirations lead to frustration. Treatment resulted in more ambitious savings goals, but nearly all individuals fell far short of reaching these goals. Two years later, treated individuals had not saved more, and actually had lower borrowing and business investments. Treatment also reduced belief in the amount of control over one's life. Setting aspirations too high can lead to frustration, leading individuals to reduce their economic investments.

TI  - The impact of technological and institutional transformation of the global financial market on education
T2  - REVISTA TEMPOS E ESPACOS EDUCACAO
AB  - The article is devoted to forming new educational directions conditioned by the technological and institutional transformation of the global financial market in the 21st century. The modern digital economy puts forward new requirements for the competencies and professional ethics of specialists working in the investment sphere. The authors have identified the key factors determining the tasks of modernizing the training of financial analysts, bankers, and lawyers specializing in investment law. The problem concerns issues of digitalizing and globalizing investment flows, forming investment ecosystems, and expanding the participation of large financial businesses in educational projects. The authors conclude that global technological and socio-economic transformations stimulate the entire financial world, including Russia, to revise their business models, and the spheres of financial and specialized legal education - to actively modernize according to market requirements.

TI  - Situating financial literacy
T2  - CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON ACCOUNTING
AB  - This paper comments on the conceptualisation of financial literacy by investigating how it is defined, problematised, and operationalised as a part of the efforts to overcome its perceived impediments. The backdrop of this study is the idea that the financial literacy movement goes hand in hand with the financialisation of society. By reporting from a study of financial literacy practices, the aim is to disentangle the notion of financial literacy from the assumption that it is a singular capability that, when gained, will automatically affect people's financial practices. The paper draws on a recent development in literacy research, New Literacy Studies, and on its division into autonomous and ideological definitions of literacy. The empirical illustrations originate from the efforts made to decrease financial illiteracy among Swedish adolescents and the demand for financial literacy in audit committees. Contrary to earlier studies, this paper demonstrates that financial literacy does not merely refer to a character trait that researchers may find lacking among the marginalised actors in society. Financial literacy cannot merely be viewed as the ability to read and write in the language of finance and accounting. Instead, financial literacy is a concept that needs to be situated and studied in practice because the characteristics that constitute financial literacy, or those that apply to it, vary with time and place.

TI  - Keep your customer knowledgeable: financial advisors as educators
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - Educational programmes aimed at increasing financial literacy are typically scarcely effective or have relatively quick 'decay' periods. In this paper, I provide evidence that financial advisors are an effective way to increase investors' financial awareness. I check this relationship using three measures of financial literacy: basic, advanced and overall; and also test different typologies of advisors. Results indicate that financial advisors have a significant educational role; in particular, the presence of independent financial advisors tends to increase the 'advanced' financial literacy of their clients. The study has potentially important policy implications, as it provides robust evidence that investors' financial literacy can be increased in a gradual and stable way that does not directly affect public funds.

TI  - Student-managed investment funds (SMIFs) in India: the perspectives of student fund managers
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION IN BUSINESS
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore how the student fund managers perceive the benefits of being part of the fund. Furthermore, this paper examines the country-specific challenges of setting up and managing a student-managed investment fund (SMIF) in India. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative content analysis technique is used to identify, compare and retrieve critical themes about the present state of SMIF clubs in India. The data collection method involved structured, in-depth online interviews with ten student fund managers from various higher educational institutions in India. Findings Some of the study's key findings indicate that the existence of SMIFs as part of learning facilitates group decision-making and peer learning. Additionally, this study brings to light specific issues related to registration, incorporating real-world practices and integrating SMIF into the academic curriculum. Social implications The outcomes of this study shall be of use to students and the teaching fraternity across Indian colleges and universities who aspire to set up SMIFs as part of experiential learning. This study will also help existing SMIF clubs in India understand how their counterparts work and can consequently improvise their organizational structure and functioning. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first interview-based evaluation of the present structure of SMIFs structured as clubs in India.

TI  - A booster to conditional cash transfer programme: experimental evidence on financial inclusion and livelihood enhancement project
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
AB  - While Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Programmes have contributed to sustained economic growth in many countries, existing evaluations show that the Honduran CCT programme has only a modest impact on poverty. This study examines a causal impact of a training project on financial inclusion and livelihood enhancement conducted as a booster to increase the effectiveness of the CCT programme. Based on a graduation approach, the project provides multi-faceted interventions to randomly selected CCT beneficiaries. We estimate intention-to-treat effects and find that the interventions significantly increase financial literacy and inclusion, including knowledge of financial institutions, financial accounts, bookkeeping, and pro-saving attitudes. We also find that the treated individuals in rural areas gain significant income from business, livestock farming, and agriculture by switching employment. Importantly, we find evidence that the interventions contribute to female empowerment by changing the intra-household decision-making process. The impact is much larger in rural areas, where financial markets are underdeveloped, and the traditional gender pattern is more prevalent. The intervention seems to reduce the urban-rural gap.

TI  - A loop diagram pedagogy: seeing the unseen in the forward market efficiency hypothesis
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose - In an introductory finance course, business school students often report difficulty in dealing with several variables and regression equations in testing the forward market efficiency and its relevant hypotheses: forward rate unbiasedness, rational expectations, risk neutrality and homogeneous expectations. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - Although each of these hypotheses may be relatively easy to understand one by one, it is harder to see their linkages. Thus, the author develops the loop diagram for supplementing traditional instruction methods.
   Findings - The author finds that a significant majority of students prefer the loop diagram approach. Furthermore, students using loop diagram display more understanding of the forward market efficiency than those with access to a conventional instruction.
   Originality/value - The loop diagram provides students a simple visual aid for formulating a complete set of regressions and enables them to analyze a richer set of relationships between several hypotheses than what they typically see in finance textbooks.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL SCIENCES & PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This investigation uncovers the factors influencing financial capability by utilizing behavioural science and ethnography. The study employs a representative sample from across the United Kingdom with a total of 72 households. This presents a unique opportunity to establish how the general population understands and utilises money, their views and attitudes towards money, and how this impacted each of the three financial behaviours. This investigation utilised a behaviour change theory to comprehensively and systematically encompass influences on the three behaviours underpinning financial capability. We were also able to design interventions based upon the most significant influencing factors. As such the interventions could simultaneously reduce the impact of significant barriers and further accentuate the effect of enablers to each financial behaviour.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to test how priming manipulation affects time preference (subjective discount rates) and risk aversion. In this study, we exposed subjects to visual (pictorial) and textual priming for vacation and for old age in order to influence their time preference. The results indicate that our pictorial priming manipulations did affect time preference and subjective discount rates: vacation scenes increased present preference, and pictures of older people reduced present preference. The pictorial priming with vacation scenes also increased risk aversion. On the other hand, textual priming did not affect time preference or risk aversion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The Effects of Web-Based Peer Assessment and Peer Feedback Quality on Students' Performances in a Financial Market Course
T2  - TECHTRENDS
AB  - Web-based peer assessment is a valuable way to cultivate active life-long learning in the modern era. This study proposed a peer-learning teaching approach that incorporates a web-based system, Tronclass, and the mechanisms of peer assessment and feedback in a financial market course to improve students' learning performances and motivation. Sixty-eight college students participated in the course during a semester. Results showed that the students demonstrated higher scores in the post-test than the pre-test in terms of financial markets knowledge test and financial planning report, though there was no significant improvement in learning motivation. The students provided feedback of higher quality in the final report and the quality aspects of first-person and specificity were found to predict student performances. These results indicated that the combination of a web-based tool with a peer-learning approach offers an alternative and meaningful approach to increase individuals' performance and attitudes.

TI  - Is Financial Literacy Dangerous? Financial Literacy, Behavioral Factors, and Financial Choices of Households
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES
AB  - Using original purpose-built 2018 Japanese survey data, we estimate the financial behaviors and attitudes of households. We find that financial literacy plays an important and consistent role in financial decision-making. However, the actual behaviors are counter-intuitive: people with high levels of financial literacy tend to take too many risks, overborrow, and hold naive financial attitudes. That is, financial literacy tends to cause people to become daring and reckless toward some financial aspects. By contrast, financially literate people are better at retirement planning and are indifferent to gambling. Preferences such as risk and loss aversions and discount factors, also play a role in financial choices.

AB  - This study evaluates the impact of implementing a simulation-based experiential learning method on student satisfaction. We develop a simulation-based experiential learning activity and use it in teaching a postgraduate finance course to engage students in the learning process and enable them to develop deeper understanding of the finance theories, models and concepts covered in the course. We then use a survey to collect data from students and use a Structural Equations Modelling technique to test our research hypotheses. Our results show that the simulation-based experiential learning activity can provide students with a hands-on experience of the real-world practice of finance. This helps students to engage in the learning process and become active learners who utilize deep learning strategies. Consequently, learners become more satisfied with their learning experience.

TI  - SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC DETERMINANTS OF FINANCIAL LITERACY LEVELS
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - This article analyses the sociodemographic determinants associated with the financial literacy levels of the Chilean population based on three dimensions: (1) knowledge; (2) behaviour; and (3) attitude. The study draws from data of the first and, thus far, the only national survey that has measured financial competency, conducted in 2016 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), funded by the Financial Market Commission (CMF in Spanish) and the Andean Development Corporation (CAF in Spanish). It analyses the impact sociodemographic factors such as sex, age, education, and employment situation have on the financial literacy level of the population surveyed (N = 1.224). For each dimension, logistic regression models were adjusted consistent with the global financial literacy index. This method aimed to calculate, based on these variables, the probability that an individual may possess adequate knowledge, behaviour, and financial attitude. The findings indicate that a person between 30 and 60 years old, with a high education level, who earns a high income, will have a greater probability of possessing an adequate financial literacy level.

TI  - A Study of the Emotional Intelligence and Personality Traits of University Finance Students
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - Studies on financial behavior indicate that emotional intelligence (EI) and personality traits (PTs) explain much of the bias in financial activity. This study aims to identify in which dimensions of theEI and PTs of university students in finance further training is needed to avoid financial behavior bias. To this end, the EI and PT levels of a sample of university finance students and financial industry professionals were compared using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue) and Big Five Inventory questionnaire. Subsequently, the dimensions of EI and PTs in which students have a deficit compared to professionals were identified, and the impacts that this deficit causes on the financial behavior of students were determined. The results indicate that students are deficient in the EI competencies related to empathy, emotion regulation, self-motivation, stress management, optimism, and self-esteem. Furthermore, PTs are related to kindness, awareness, openness, and extraversion. This deficit makes students more likely to have financial behavior biases such as risk tolerance, endowment, optimism, self-control, and loss aversion. These findings suggest that universities should be aware of providing financial students with full training in EI and PTs to help them successfully address their professional future.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to utilize decision tree (DT) analysis to examine the relationship between income level, financial satisfaction, financial confidence, financial knowledge, and several demographics with a goal of better understanding desirable financial behavior. The emphasis of this analysis is focused particularly upon better understanding the role of financial knowledge in desirable behavior outcomes. DT analysis is most useful when an analysis includes numerous variables and solving problems where the cumulative learning process is inherent. Our DT analysis of four FINRA National Financial Capability datasets (2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018) suggest that financial knowledge is a relevant variable only under specific circumstances and for respondents with relatively higher income levels. Key variables in the DT analysis included income level and financial satisfaction.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - This study investigates the role of financial knowledge in various short-term and long-term financial behaviors among Millennials in the United States. Results from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) indicate that Millennials have lower levels of objective financial knowledge and similar levels of perceived financial knowledge as compared to all households. Consistent multivariate results find financial knowledge to be positively associated with performing positive short-term and long-term financial behaviors. Results are found to be robust across different measurements of financial knowledge and behavior, and the issue of the potential for reverse causality is specifically addressed. This study provides a comprehensive financial profile of Millennials with important insight for policymakers as well as financial practitioners.

TI  - When old becomes new: a case study of oral examination as an online assessment tool
T2  - ASSESSMENT & EVALUATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Assessment is an important element of any effective teaching and learning strategy. Designing an appropriate assessment strategy is a continual challenge for instructors because the assessment structure must be well aligned with the intended learning outcomes. Technological advances have led to an expansion of online and distance modes of course delivery and brought new challenges, such as accessibility and legality, identity security and academic dishonesty. This study describes the application of an oral examination as a form of assessment in the online context. The findings demonstrate that oral examination can assist in overcoming some of the challenges associated with online learning. However, careful planning is required to ensure that it meets the principles fundamental to a successful assessment strategy: validity, reliability and fairness.

TI  - Children's understanding of financial literacy and parents' choice of financial knowledge learning methods in Malaysia
T2  - METHODSX
AB  - Financial literacy is an essential lifelong skill that should be taught to children at any age. It holds the key to develop a generation of adults who are knowledgeable about money and the economy. Additionally, OECD (2018) suggests that using digital tools could significantly enhance financial literacy and well-being. Therefore, this paper aims to: (i) assess the financial literacy level of primary school children in the northern region of Malaysia and (ii) explore interactive and engaging methods for teaching financial literacy. The sample size was determined using Krejcie and Morgan's (1970) approach, resulting in 419 primary school students aged 7 to 12 and their parents. An online questionnaire was employed, and multi-regression analysis was conducted. The findings highlighted those primary students displayed a high level of financial literacy, scoring above 80 % on the questionnaire. Furthermore, parents expressed a preference for their children to enroll in personal finance subjects offered by schools, have financial assignments or activities at school, and engage in online financial games. The study emphasized the crucial roles of schools, teachers, and active parental involvements to enhance financial literacy. This study recommends incorporating interactive and attractive teaching methods through in-class and online activities at the school level.

TI  - Teaching financial literacy through the use of market research and advertising instruction A non traditional approach
T2  - REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to describe how librarians used elements of market research, advertising and media literacy in a personal finance class.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Librarians each semester guest lecture one session in a personal finance class "Foundations of Money Education." Through this class, librarians present engaging material about market research and advertising in an effort to encourage students to think about how these external forces influence their spending behavior.
   Findings
   Students appreciate learning about advertising through the engaging use of commercials. While responses were mixed as to the applicability of the topic, the majority of students agreed that the topic was a worthwhile addition to the personal finance curriculum.
   Originality/value
   Topics such as budgets, savings, and mortgages are typically taught in personal finance classes. Teaching information about market research and advertising is a topic that is usually not covered in a personal finance class.

TI  - Entrepreneurship as a Neglected Pitfall in Future Finnish Teachers' Readiness to Teach 21st Century Competencies and Financial Literacy: Expectancies, Values, and Capability
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine entrepreneurship in the context of future Finnish teachers' readiness to teach 21st century (broad-based) competencies. Teachers' self-efficacy in teaching entrepreneurial skills and financial matters is vital for their pupils to actively participate and flourish in future society. The study utilized survey data of future teachers' expectancy-values in teaching seven broad-based competencies of the current national curriculum and their financial literacy. Future teachers expressed high interest in all competencies but reported the least self-efficacy and highest cost in teaching ICT as well as working life and entrepreneurship competencies. Teaching self-efficacy (TSE) in entrepreneurial competencies was predicted by subjective evaluations of financial capability and TSE in consumer skills. Teaching STEM subjects as well as male gender were related to better objective financial knowledge. We discuss the implications of observed financial capability, lack in self-efficacy, and high experienced cost of teaching these competencies. Support for future teachers' readiness to teach working life skills, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy through phenomenon-based school subject collaboration, formal teacher training, and digital applications are emphasized.

TI  - Financial literacy: an exploratory analysis in Portugal
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - This work aims to verify, through an exploratory factor analysis, which are the determinants of the financial literacy of the Portuguese over 18 years old. The quantitative method is used, by using a questionnaire survey, and 839 surveys were obtained. It is observed that the factors resulting from the exploratory factor analysis are: (1) planning and financial goals to 1-2 years, (2) long-term savings and (3) the taste for numerical calculation. We analyse the statistically significant differences between means regarding gender, school education, the existence of household budgets and age. It is concluded that it is important to obtain some financial training at the beginning and throughout life, to better be able to make the financial family planning, to make applications with better return and to reduce the financial risk of the family. It is concluded that the closer to the retirement age, the more people tend to save, since during retirement income usually decreases.

TI  - The impact of undergraduate personal finance education on individual financial literacy, attitudes and intentions
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - Financial literacy education features prominently among the policy options available to improve personal financial decision-making. Notwithstanding calls to expand delivery of financial literacy units at university level, such offerings are relatively rare with little evaluation. We provide an evaluation of the impact on financial literacy, financial attitudes and financial behaviour intentions of a semester unit in personal finance delivered to undergraduates at an Australian university, carefully controlling for confounding effects in the analysis. We report increases in objective and subjective financial literacy and an additional gender effect. Contrary to previous speculation, we do not find overconfidence as an associated outcome.

TI  - Analyzing the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion by microfinance banks in developing countries: social network theoretical approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY
AB  - Purpose The main purpose of this study is to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected from the poor who resides in rural Uganda. Structural equation modelling (SEM) through analysis of moment structures (AMOS) was used to analyze the data. Bootstrap approach with 5,000 samples was run to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Findings The results showed that social network significantly and positively mediate the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. In addition, financial literacy also has a direct significant and positive effect on financial inclusion. Overall, the findings suggest that the presence of social network fully mediate the effect of financial literacy on financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Research limitations/implications This study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Future studies could adopt longitudinal research design to establish the dynamic characteristics of the samples under study over time. Besides, this study collected data from only poor households who were clients of microfinance banks located in rural Uganda. It ignored the other section of the population who were not the poor. Therefore, future studies could use the other section of the population who are clients of commercial banks. Practical implications The advocates of financial literacy and managers of microfinance banks in developing countries should ensure using existing local structures such as community and village associations to conduct financial literacy training. The village associations help in mobilizing members who are close-knit based on the existing societal ties that can be used as a channel for disseminating vital financial literacy information. Indeed, financial literacy workshops, seminars, and business clinics can be easily conducted to individuals who are members of the village associations. Originality/value This paper integrates social network theory in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Social network acts as a conduit through which financial knowledge and skills flow to increase the scope of financial inclusion of the poor in developing countries.

T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify the profile of the Portuguese regarding the perception of financial literacy. Design/methodology/approach The utilized methodology is based on a questionnaire survey that assesses the perception of financial literacy. The sample is composed of 830 Portuguese individuals over 18 years old. Findings The results show that the financial literacy scale presents a tri-factor structure with adequate validity and reliability levels. The three obtained factors are designated 1-2-year financial planning and goals, long-term saving and taste for numeric calculations. Originality/value The originality in this study is shown in the application of the cluster analysis, which demonstrates the formation of three clusters that present different perceptions of financial literacy, classifying the Portuguese into a cluster of high financial literacy and taste for numeric calculation, a cluster of low financial literacy and a cluster of financial planning and saving but without the taste for numeric calculation.

TI  - Divergence between economic growth and stock market performance in India: implications for investor education and financial well-being
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Amidst declining trends of Indian macroeconomic indicators during COVID-19 period, certain indicators, which can be takes as proxies of investors' behaviour, sentiments and biases, were discerned in Indian securities markets. The study provides significant insight into sentiments and biases of a particular segment of retail investors trading in uncertain times of COVID-19, whose investment behaviour may have serious impact on their financial well-being in the long-term. This exploratory-descriptive study uses data collected by various regulators and government sources in India and abroad to evaluate the behaviour of investors in the backdrop of macroeconomic trends during COVID-19. After analysing the trends of investor participation, trading behaviour and general sentiment in the Indian capital markets and evaluating the implications of these investor-related behaviours on the financial well-being of individual investors, a comprehensive and segmented approach of financial literacy has been recommended to safeguard financial well-being of investors.

TI  - Literacy, profile, and determinants of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin: Survey results
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR BUSINESS
AB  - This study attempts to assess individuals' Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin literacy, and then identifies different profiles based on the literacy levels of these cryptocurrencies, and further investigates whether financial literacy explains Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin literacy. Using a sample from higher learning institutions in Malaysia, the results indicate that individuals exhibit higher knowledge on Bitcoin compared to Ethereum and Litecoin. Cluster analysis revealed two clusters, where the high-cryptocurrency-literacy cluster (high in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin literacy) has a distinct demographic profile and higher financial literacy than the low-cryptocurrency-literacy cluster (low in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin literacy). Financial literacy is shown to explain Bitcoin and Ethereum literacy, but not Litecoin literacy.

TI  - Equity illusions
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAW ECONOMICS & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Although equity-compensation grants for rank-and-file employees are common in startups and are considered an ingrained part of their business culture, little is known about how employees approach this form of compensation. We begin filling this gap by examining employees' financial literacy regarding equity compensation and their willingness to forgo cash compensation for startup equity. Using a survey and a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques with conventional regression modeling, we find that employees commonly respond to economically irrelevant signals and misinterpret other important signals. The findings suggest that employees harbor a range of "market illusions" regarding startup equity that can lead to inefficiencies in the labor market, which sophisticated employers can legally exploit. The results raise questions about the protection of employees in their investor capacity in a market where highly sophisticated repeat players, such as venture capital investors, interact with unorganized and uninformed retail investors.

TI  - Investor Education and IPO Participation
T2  - EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
AB  - This study analyzes how the educational characteristics of investors affect their participation in initial public offerings on the stock market. We use a unique dataset from the Tallinn stock exchange that combines the stock market transactions of a full business cycle from 2004 to 2012 with an official educational dataset. Having controlled for gender, age, wealth, and investor trading behavior, we find empirical evidence that investors with better high-school exam results in mathematics and high-school leavers without an academic degree are less likely to participate in an IPO. The opposite is true for investors who have higher education, a bachelor's degree or a degree in the social sciences, economics or public administration, who are all more likely to participate in an IPO. We find that the long-term returns of IPO stocks underperform benchmark index returns.

TI  - Measuring Travel Insurance Literacy: Effect on Trust in Providers and Intention to Purchase
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH
AB  - Recent research suggests that some deficiencies in the insurance industry might be associated with tourists' lack of knowledge. However, the literature does not present a tool that captures objective knowledge of travel insurance literacy. This research presents a comprehensive, multi-step scale development process resulting in a 15-item scale, which measures objective knowledge about travel insurance terms, regulations, and processes. The results show that travel insurance literacy is associated with trust in sellers. Although no relationship was found between travel insurance literacy and perceived travel risks, these two constructs influence purchase intention. The results also show that there is no relationship between subjective knowledge (self-assessment literacy) and objective knowledge (ratings on the scale). Hence, the research presents a new measurement tool that differs from self-assessment scales prevailing in the tourism literature, opening new opportunities for literacy constructs in the field. Finally, the findings present key managerial implications for the insurance industry.

TI  - Teaching Through Television: Experimental Evidence on Entrepreneurship Education in Tanzania
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - Can television be used to teach and foster entrepreneurship among youth in developing countries? We report from a randomized control field experiment of an edutainment show on entrepreneurship broadcasted over almost three months on national television in Tanzania. The field experiment involved more than 2,000 secondary school students, where the treatment group was incentivized to watch the edutainment show. We find some suggestive evidence of the edutainment show making the viewers more interested in entrepreneurship and business, particularly among females. However, our main finding is a negative effect: the edutainment show discouraged investment in schooling without convincingly replacing it with some other valuable activity. Administrative data show a strong negative treatment effect on school performance, and long-term survey data show that fewer treated students continue schooling, but we do not find much evidence of the edutainment show causing an increase in business ownership. The fact that an edutainment show for entrepreneurship caused the students to invest less in education carries a general lesson to the field experimental literature by showing the importance of taking a broad view of possible implications of a field intervention.

TI  - Re-intermediation of the crypto asset ecosystem by banks: An empirical study on acceptance drivers among the populace
T2  - ELECTRONIC MARKETS
AB  - After the initial surge in decentralized finance, widespread public adoption did not materialize. A predominant portion of the populace harbors distrust towards the crypto asset market. Conversely, banks, serving as intermediaries in financial management, enjoy heightened trust. The contemporary development within the banking sector indicates an inclination towards integrating into the crypto asset market. This integration results in new business models for banking institutions and emergent opportunities for their clientele. Prior research addresses perceptions surrounding cryptocurrencies. The present research augments this field by investigating the acceptance of crypto assets. Specifically, we conducted an empirical user study to analyze investing behaviors. By adapting the theoretical framework of the technology acceptance model to the unique characteristics of crypto assets, we highlight acceptance drivers. Notable variances in awareness of crypto assets affect investment decisions. The findings of this study contribute to social welfare by identifying impediments to sustainable investment practices. Additionally, these insights facilitate a more sophisticated comprehension of strategic alternatives available to banking institutions.

TI  - THE IMPORTANCE OF SPORTING ACTIVITY FOR MEN (AS ADVANCED CONSUMERS) SELF-ESTEEM AND REDUCTION OF SOCIAL EXCLUSION
T2  - TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS
AB  - Social exclusion and the problems caused by this phenomenon have always been relevant to researchers. Men mostly fall to social exclusion groups because of their gender identity stereotypes in society. Consumption in debt might be understood as the compensation for a lack of masculinity and recognition yourself as a confident, respectful man with high esteem and an appropriate position in society. In other hand, debt consumption creates the conditions to experience social exclusion, experience a sense of diminished self-esteem. Aim of the study: to reveal the significance of sporting activity for men, who are experiencing social exclusion due to advanced consumption, self-esteem. Results: All study participants, males who have experienced social exclusion due to advanced consumption, have experienced severe personality problems, i.e. low self-esteem, mistrust, lack of self-confidence, loss of health and social health, as well as job loss, family crises, and social status decline.

TI  - Shaping entrepreneurship in developing countries: the role of savings and credit groups
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In this study, we analyse savings and credit groups (SCGs) to investigate whether belonging to these groups contributes favourably to entrepreneurship. SCGs are community-based groups that represent a form of informal finance in developing countries. For the analysis, we adopt the social embeddedness theory, and test our hypotheses on a unique sample of respondents to a survey in Kenya finding a positive relationship between SCGs and the creation of new ventures. The results show that the levels of education and wealth are positively associated with the likelihood of creating a new venture, but SCG membership negatively moderates these relationships. Thus, the benefits of SCG membership are larger for less-educated and less-wealthy individuals that can offset, at least in part, the disadvantages related to these low levels. Finally, to provide insights for future research and policy, we focus on the group characteristics associated with the likelihood of creating new ventures.

AB  - The article considers the reasons for employees holding large proportions of their financial savings and investments in company stock, drawing on explanations proposed in the behavioral finance literature. Utilizing data from a survey of employees participating in the United Kingdom Save as You Earn stock options and savings scheme, it is found that substantial proportions of stock owners hold sizeable concentrations of employer stock. Several explanations for this risky behavior are tested, with familiarity, reciprocity, and inertia found to be associated with portfolio concentration. Organizational commitment and naive extrapolation from recent stock prices are not. The implications for theory and practice are considered.

TI  - Make the Invisible Underbanked Visible: Who Are the Underbanked?
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - When the COVID-19 pandemic caused businesses to close and triggered high unemployment in 2020, millions of unbanked U.S. households, those without a bank account, had to wait for weeks and months for their stimulus checks to arrive. The delayed delivery of stimulus checks issued by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act sheds light on the critical role that safe, affordable financial services and products play in people's ability to cope with financial shocks. Dialogues over banking practices have been framed with a banked-unbanked dichotomous framework that masks more nuanced understandings of households 'financial realities, including the underbanked, who use a bank account and alternative financial services simultaneously. Using data from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study, this study identifies and compares predictors of being underbanked and unbanked, respectively. We found that the underbanked group is a sizable, distinctively different group. Income volatility and welfare benefit receipt are both associated with being underbanked rather than unbanked. Our findings call for expanding the current, limited framework to gain more complete, nuanced understandings of banking practices.

TI  - Intergenerational bankruptcy risks: Learning from parents' mistakes*
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION
AB  - This study investigates inter-generational transmissions of parental bankruptcy shock on children's financial behavior in adulthood. Our results show that younger children who were 9 years or below when their parents declared bankruptcy were 2-3 % points less likely to declare bankruptcy than their older siblings who were 10 years and older when the parents' bankruptcy event occurred. We rule out alternative hypotheses, including birth order, cohort effects, and truncated sample bias. We find corroborative evidence for the "parent socialization" channel, where bankrupt parents, through interactions with children during childhood years, influence their financial behavior and reduce the risks of their children repeating the same mistakes in adulthood.

TI  - Psychological characteristics and household savings behavior: The importance of accounting for latent heterogeneity
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - We employ a finite mixture model with maximum likelihood (ML) estimation to analyze latent heterogeneity in the relationship between psychological characteristics and household savings behavior. In a one-step ML estimation approach, we estimate a class membership model and a behavioral model of the classes jointly. Adopting this approach enables us to simultaneously assess how socio-demographic characteristics affect class membership probabilities and estimate class-specific regression coefficients, to test whether psychological characteristics predict savings behavior differently across latent classes. We apply this approach to a representative sample of UK households (n =3382) and identify two different latent classes: striving versus established households. We find that the relationship between psychological characteristics and savings behavior differs across these two classes, demonstrating the importance of accounting for latent heterogeneity when studying the drivers of savings behavior. Our results have implications for policymakers attempting to improve household savings behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sticking to your plan: The role of present bias for credit card paydown
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We use data from an online financial service to show that many consumers fail to stick to their self-set debt paydown plans. This behavior is best explained by present bias. Our empirical approach is informed by a parsimonious model showing that the sensitivity of spending to paycheck receipt reflects a present-biased agents short-run impatience, and that this sensitivity is reduced by available resources only for agents who are aware (sophisticated) of their future impatience. Classifying users accordingly, we find that (i) sophisticated users debt paydown decreases with short-run impatience, and that (ii) planned paydown is most predictive of actual paydown for sophisticated users.
