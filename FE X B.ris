AB  - The purpose of the study is to evaluate the knowledge level and behavior that business school students from Veracruz, Mexico have in relation to interest rates, inflation, savings, credit and budgeting. For the empirical study, a non-experimental quantitative cross-sectioned and descriptive design was followed. The test used was that of Moreno-García et al. (2017), which was answered by 309 undergraduate students from Veracruz, Mexico. Data measurement was performed using descriptive statistics, cross tables and the non-parametric test of proportions (Z). The main findings point to the fact that more students understand well the impact of inflation than the relationship between interest rates and bonds; that students do not consider that saving provides financial security; and that there is no gender difference in terms of saving behavior. Most of the business school students do not have a credit card, prefer debit cards and have acceptable practices in budget planning. In summary, the results of this study show a good level of financial knowledge in relation to interest rates, inflation, investment, credit, and show adequate behavior of savings and credit card, as well as the use of the budgets. However, it was expected that each item would have a greater number of correct answers, considering that the population under study has received training in mathematics, economics, and finance. It is noteworthy that, in relation to gender, there are more men who correctly answer the questions about inflation and it is women who have better practices in the use of their credit cards © 2022 by Cherkas Global University All rights reserved

AB  - This study investigates the factors that affect farmers’ access to Food Security and Agricultural Credit (FSAC) services for the farmers of Pakistan who have no access to banking but have a feasible farm business. Using multiple regressions and logistic analysis, the authors revealed the determinants of farmers’ financial literacy and analyzed the variables which affected the farmers’ accessibility to FSAC. Results indicated that the average financial literacy of respondents was at a moderate level. It was affected by the age of respondents, length of their education, distance to nearby cities, ownership of bank accounts, annual income, and financial education experience. The FSAC accessibility was also impacted by the area of cultivated land, interest rate, collateral, farms’ income, financial literacy index, credit accessibility experiences, the legal status of farmer groups, and the amount of a loan. Some of the issues that prevent farmers from having widespread access to the FSAC include the lack of loan need, lack of FSAC awareness, lack of collateral, loan usury perspective, loan rejection experience, fear of borrowing from the bank, and inactive farmer groups. The study contributes to the existing literature on the determinants of farmers’ access and choice of credit sources by using a primary data set. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In a context of market volatility, the growing complexity of financial products, and a shift towards self-employment, there is an increasing demand for inclusive financial services for sole traders and micro-organizations. To address this need, we conducted a study using real-time data from a Fintech lender in the Czech Republic to assess the effectiveness of a new financial literacy based psychometric credit scoring model (PSM) in improving access to finance for micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSME) sector, particularly sole traders, and micro-organizations, during volatile market conditions. This study affirms that PSMs play a significant role in responsibly including this underserved sector. Specifically, we observed a 30% higher approval rate and a 23% lower default rate when utilizing the PSM versus the traditional credit scoring model (TCSM). Moreover, during the period of substantial market volatility and instability, such as the state-of-emergency during the COVID-19 pandemic, the PSM exhibited a 13% higher approval rate at a 20% lower default rate than the TCSM. This evidence supports the proposition that PSMs offer a viable option for promoting financial inclusion and targeted financial education among MSMEs in the face of instable financial markets. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - In recent years, maternal and child health professionals have been seeking approaches to integrating the Life Course Perspective and social determinants of health into their work. In this article, we describe how community input, staff feedback, and evidence from the field that the connection between wealth and health should be addressed compelled the Contra Costa Family, Maternal and Child Health (FMCH) Programs Life Course Initiative to launch Building Economic Security Today (BEST). BEST utilizes innovative strategies to reduce inequities in health outcomes for low-income Contra Costa families by improving their financial security and stability. FMCH Programs' Women, Infants, and Children Program (WIC) conducted BEST financial education classes, and its Medically Vulnerable Infant Program (MVIP) instituted BEST financial assessments during public health nurse home visits. Educational and referral resources were also developed and distributed to all clients. The classes at WIC increased clients' awareness of financial issues and confidence that they could improve their financial situations. WIC clients and staff also gained knowledge about financial resources in the community. MVIP's financial assessments offered clients a new and needed perspective on their financial situations, as well as support around the financial and psychological stresses of caring for a child with special health care needs. BEST offered FMCH Programs staff opportunities to engage in non-traditional, cross-sector partnerships, and gain new knowledge and skills to address a pressing social determinant of health. We learned the value of flexible timelines, maintaining a long view for creating change, and challenging the traditional paradigm of maternal and child health. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - There is a socially constructed perception that people with mental illnesses do not have the resilience to endure the pressures of the capitalist model of work. Solidarity economy (se) appears as an alternative for the inclusion of mentally ill people in the realm of work and productivity, enabling them to (re)produce their subjectivities. In this study, we develop a critical reflection on the possibilities of entrepreneuring, solidarity economy, and financial/accounting literacy as tools towards a health promotion strategy that empowers and allows the emancipation of these individuals, so that they may (re)write their stories and give society an account of themselves other than their mental illness. This paper starts from the analysis of the experience of two Brazilian se ventures engaged in mental health promotion, in which we proposed and conducted a financial education program aimed at providing se worker-members with tools to actively participate in discussions about financial and accounting-related decisions. Afterwards, we engaged in an action research exercise, building on lessons learned: the importance of abandoning preconceived ideas of mental illness and relying on sharing experiences and participation; and how real-life struggles are a source of knowledge, as discussed through the concept of “learning by doing.”. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - Financial imagination plays a fundamental, yet ambivalent role in the establishment of hierarchies within and between business schools, and in business life at large. This study examines this process in the ‘middle tier’ of business education: that is, in the social space in which students and instructors understand themselves to occupy a ‘mid-range’ position within an order of excellence and success. Largely articulated through business school rankings, this order strongly relies on the centrality of the financial curriculum, proficiency in which is understood as both a proxy for smartness and a sign of moneymaking capacity. In the ‘middle tier’, this order manifests in the form of an anxiety: an order that, though legitimate, is thought not to be attained, or hardly attainable. The study draws from ethnographic investigation in a ‘middle tier’ business school with attention to how finance is made sense of in relation to an alternative curriculum, and in connection with the aim of ‘making it to the top’. A comparison with a ‘top tier’ business school allows furthering understanding of how the order of business schools relies on the anxiety of finance in order to reproduce an acquiescence to dominant financial imagination. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - During the last 25 years, the Estonian economy has transitioned from a centrally planned economy to a market-oriented, globally open, highly competitive economy. Although during these years there has been fast growth and Estonians could tell a lot of success stories, research shows that management practices are still less advanced compared to those in enterprises from developed countries. Increased competition, openness and innovation increased the significance of more sophisticated management control systems (MCS ). Researchers accentuate the role of managers and their education and training in using and developing more sophisticated MCS in companies. The objective of the current paper is to better understand how changes in the business environment, managerial training and education are connected to developments in MCS in Estonia. This article provides an overview of the statistics and studies completed in Estonia over the last 25 years. As this study shows, the last decade has brought a different level of internationalization and development in the business environment and business education. The problems associated with developments in MCS , using cloud technology, business education and managerial training are the same in Estonia as in developed countries. To develop the business and economic environment in the country, Estonian entrepreneurs need high-level data processing, analytical and financial education, and practical training courses.

AB  - Using data from a survey of small German craft businesses, this article sheds light on the drivers of working capital management (WCM) efforts of small enterprises and their relation with performance. Unlike previous studies, this article explicitly investigates the routines small firms undertake to manage their working capital (WC). Based on the argumentation of asset orchestration theory, factor and cluster analysis are applied to identify four distinct types of small businesses with regard to their WCM approach. Thereupon, several regression analyses are applied to identify the drivers of this differentiation. The results determine financial education and skill of individual personnel as the main driver of WCM routine implementation in small businesses. Firm age, willingness to grow in size, and ease of access to external funding are also affecting WCM undertakings. Considering performance, evidence indicates a positive association between the implementation of WCM routines and both liquidity and profitability. © 2021 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil Canadien de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.

AB  - Saving promotion interventions have gained momentum in international development in recent years. Our analysis investigates whether saving promotion can effectively increase savings, consumption, and future-oriented investments in Sub-Saharan Africa. In an extensive search of 28 academic and policy-focused databases in the fields of economics, psychology, and social sciences, 9330 titles and abstracts of published and unpublished studies were screened and 27 randomized controlled trials on saving promotion interventions fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these, 24 studies reporting on an aggregated sample of 87,025 individuals provided sufficient information to be included in the meta-analysis. Robust-variance estimations of pooled effect sizes show small but significant impacts on poverty reduction, including increases in household expenditures and incomes, higher returns from family businesses, and improved food security. They also show positive and significant impacts on more intermediate outcomes including total savings, pro-saving attitudes, financial literacy, and investments in small-scale family businesses. Our results do not show significant effects on assets, housing quality, education, or health. Results from meta-regressions suggest that supply-based programs are superior to demand-enhancing program types such as financial education. They further reveal reduced program effectiveness for women. Overall, findings from this analysis suggest that saving promotion schemes are highly relevant in reducing poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa, and that future efforts should focus on expansion of banking services to the poor as well as gender-sensitive programming. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article reports on the status of consumer education in Canada in 2016 (junior and senior high), relative to the 2015-initiated federal national financial education/literacy strategy. Questions addressed: (1) Is it necessary to have separate financial education curricula when consumer education is available? and (2) Are the existing consumer education curricula adequate? After conceptualizing consumer education and literacy relative to financial education and literacy, a content analysis of provincial and territorial education documents identified 64 courses containing consumer-related content in seven subject areas. The majority (73%) of the 216 instances of consumer-related content-mostly (68%) found in home economics/family studies, social studies, mathematics, and business-pertained to resource management, with equal coverage for each of citizen participation (14%) and decision making (13%). Most (73%) of the courses were not offered until senior high. Results confirmed a fragmented and inconsistent approach to consumer education across subject areas, grade levels, provinces/territories, and regions. To stimulate dialogue, the national financial education strategy is framed as a stop-gap measure until there is political will for a pan-Canadian consumer education curriculum, predicated on the assumption that consumer education (not financial education) better prepares citizens for any future global depression. © 2018 Canadian Society for the Study of Education.

AB  - Personal financial literacy (PFL) is an imperative life skill that all 21st-century students should have. Research shows that the levels of financial literacy in both developing and developed countries are very low across people of all ages. This deplorable state of affairs has negative implications on the well-being of the populace, as evidenced by increased indebtedness, lower saving, poor planning for retirement, and the making of many poor personal financial decisions. Recognizing the potential benefits of financial literacy at both individual and national levels, many countries have started to offer financial education in their schools. This article analyzed the business subjects’ curriculum at secondary school level in Botswana and literature published on the subject of PFL, and found that there exists a gap in this area and a need to offer PFL to all learners in the school system. Despite the need for such a move, Botswana does not have a deliberate program in its curriculum that specifically addresses this problem. This article discusses the benefits of personal financial education, the inadequacy of current business subjects to meet this need, and concludes by recommending a mandatory PFL subject in the Botswana secondary school curriculum. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - High educational debt is prevalent among resident physicians and correlates with adverse well-being outcomes, including symptoms of stress and burnout. Residents also report low financial literacy levels, affecting financial well-being. Understanding resident viewpoints toward financial well-being initiatives is crucial to develop targeted resident financial well-being programs. This study aims to examine residents’ experiences financing their medical education and how these experiences influence well-being and attitudes toward financial education in residency. We recruited residents from a Southern California health system with residency programs in Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery, and Psychiatry. We contacted residents by email and text message to participate in semi-structured interviews. We conducted interviews from October 2020 to March 2021 and analyzed 59 resident interviews using reflexive thematic analysis. Among residents, 76% (45/59) had ≥ $200,000 in student loans. Residents perceived mounting medical education debt as unfairly burdensome for trainees engaged in socially beneficial work, leaving residents feeling undervalued–a feeling heightened by the stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic–and hampering well-being. Compartmentalizing debt attenuated financial stressors but often made financial education seem less pressing. A subset of residents described how financial planning restored some agency and enhanced well-being, noting that protected didactic time for financial education was crucial. Resident interviews provide practical guidance regarding designing financial education sessions. Desired education included managing debt, retirement planning, and the business of medicine. How residents framed educational debt and their degree of financial literacy impacted their well-being and sense of agency. Residents proposed that residency programs can aid in stress mitigation by providing residents with skills to help manage debt and plan for retirement. To reduce clinician indebtedness, this approach needs to occur in tandem with systemic changes to financing medical education. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Small business owners (SBOs) need a level of tax, computer accounting software, and financial statement literacy to effectively manage their cash flow, which could influence business performance. Research was conducted with small business experts to provide a greater understanding of what aids or hinders the development of these literacies for SBOs. The findings suggest that improvement could be hindered by lack of time, money, basic financial education, the complexity of the tax system, and the SBOs individual anxiety. With this understanding, recommendations can be made as to how these important literacies may be improved. © 2022, Journal of Australian Taxation Pty Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to analyze the strategies that allow sowing social entrepreneurship initiatives among young university students in Latin America. This study will also help to understand the different needs and expectations currently treated in higher education in developing its role as a promoter of entrepreneurship in students. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a multinomial logistic regression method analysis based on data collected through an online survey and applied to a sample of 599 advanced business administration students in five Latin American countries. Findings: The results indicate that three of the independent variables under study are relevant as strategies to instill in university students the initiative for creating social entrepreneurship: establishing links with social communities, providing entrepreneurial education with a social orientation, and offering financial education. Research limitations/implications: These research findings indicate the role universities should have in promoting social entrepreneurship in university students. Therefore, the proposed strategies are crucial to improving this type of entrepreneurship. Originality/value: The main contribution of this study is to analyze issues as crucial as social entrepreneurship in Latin American university students and broaden knowledge of the main strategies universities in this region must adopt so that students launch into the social area. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Globally Financial inclusion provides an opportunity to promote equal access to resources for all. One of the crucial catalysts for microenterprises development is access to the financial market. However, the growth of many microenterprises has been truncated in Ghana due to limited access to financial opportunities. Despite this challenge, little is known about the drivers of financial inclusion in Wa Municipality of the Upper West Region of Ghana. This paper examines the drivers of financial inclusion of microentrepreneurs in the Wa Municipality of the Upper West Region of Ghana. Using a close ended questionnaire, this study employed an exploratory survey design to collect data from 200 engaged in trading, manufacturing, and services. The respondents were sampled using a simple random sampling technique. Given that the outcome variable is binary, the study used a binary probit regression model for the data analysis. The results predicted that religion, awareness of loan services, business registration, and preparation of financial statements drive financial inclusion in Wa Municipality. From the results, the study recommends that financial service providers should consider social networks, entrepreneurial practice, gender and religion as sensitive drivers of financial inclusion. In addition, financial education should be intensified as knowledge of the available financial products is a key driver of financial inclusion in the Municipality. While this study has contributed to the body of literature on financial inclusion in Ghana, further research is necessary to identify consumer financial needs to meet clients’ expectations. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of this article was to analyze the factors that determine the level of financial literacy in Mexican adults, the method used for the analysis was an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model. The results reveal that age, marital status, education, number of dependents and income level in the central and southern regions were positively associated with the financial literacy index; while men and having a job were negatively associated. One of the limitations of the study lies in the number of observations regarding some variables considered. The originality of the work consists in the fact that evidence is provided considering the characteristics at the individual level for Mexico. The findings obtained can be useful for the design of public policies as well as serve as a basis for subsequent studies. Objective: The objective of conducting an investigation into the literality of financing may be to fully understand the specific provisions and clauses of financial contracts. This may include analyzing the terms and conditions set forth in loan agreements, lines of credit or other forms of financing to fully understand the obligations and responsibilities of the parties involved. Theoretical Framework: Various proposals have been developed to measure financial literacy/inclusion (BANAMEX, 2018; Dabla-Norris et al., 2015; OECD, 2018) however, in this work the methodology developed by OECD (2018) is used, said methodology can be adapted to the situation of each country. The ENIF 2018 incorporates questions that cover aspects of financial knowledge, behaviors and attitudes in adults from 18 to 70 years of age, where the maximum score obtained is seven, nine and five points for each aspect respectively, which gives a total of 21 points. The index is built from the sum of the points obtained in each aspect. Method: This sum is normalized to 100 to facilitate its interpretation (CNBV, 2019); a higher value implies greater financial literacy and a lower value the opposite. Context of financial education in Mexico The CNBV (2019) indicates that the financial literacy index for Mexico was located at a rating of 58.2 points; when broken down by components, it indicates that "financial knowledge" was located at 65.8 and Results and conclusion: Current Level of Financial Literacy: The level of financial literacy in Mexico has been determined to be relatively low, with a large proportion of the population lacking basic knowledge of financial issues. Impact on Financial Well-being: It has been shown that there is a direct correlation between the level of financial literacy and the economic well-being of individuals, highlighting the importance of improving education in this area to boost financial development and reduce economic insecurity. Demographic Gaps: Certain demographic groups, such as low-income people, youth and women, have been identified as facing greater challenges in terms of financial literacy, underscoring the need to adopt inclusive and targeted approaches to address these disparities. Importance of Financial Education: The relevance of promoting financial education programs from the early stages of life has been highlighted, both in the educational system and through community initiatives, to equip people with the necessary skills to make responsible financial decisions. and prepare them to face future economic challenges. Resarch implications: Awareness of the Importance of the Topic: Conducting research on financial literacy involves recognizing the critical relevance of this topic in today's society. This means understanding how a lack of financial literacy can negatively impact the lives of individuals and communities in terms of economic well-being, access to opportunities, and the ability to make informed decisions. Understanding the Causes and Consequences: The researcher must delve into the underlying causes of the lack of financial literacy, as well as the possible short- and long-term consequences for individuals and society as a whole. This involves analyzing factors such as access to financial education, the quality of the education received, socioeconomic and cultural barriers, among others. Identification of Areas of Improvement: Research can reveal specific areas where improvements are needed in terms of public policies, educational programs, financial services, and business practices. This may include recommendations to develop stronger school curricula, implement financial awareness campaigns, improve the accessibility of financial services, and promote transparency and accountability in the financial industry. Developing Innovative Solutions: By understanding the needs and challenges related to financial literacy, researchers can contribute to the development of innovative and effective solutions. This could involve creating interactive educational tools, designing training programs tailored to different demographic groups, or implementing financial technologies (fintech) that facilitate access to financial services and making informed decisions. Fostering Dialogue and Collaboration: Research can serve as a basis to foster dialogue between different actors, including government institutions, nonprofit organizations, private companies, academics, and civil society. This can lead to strategic collaborations and coordinated actions to address financial literacy challenges more effectively and sustainably.

AB  - Extensive empirical evidence shows that women perform worse in financial literacy tests, which implies that their financial behaviour may also be worse compared to men. However, the literature on the gender gap in financial behaviour is scanty and highly inconclusive. Using data from a survey of married and cohabiting couples living in Poland (N=1,000) and a multi-dimensional scale validated in terms of its psychometric properties, this article compares the financial behaviour of women and men. The applied tests did not show any significant gender differences in the overall financial behaviour index or in any of the subdomains of the behaviour distinguished in the applied scale. Using the social identity theory as a framework, we discuss possible explanations of these puzzling findings, which may imply that women are unnecessarily considered a disadvantaged group in terms of preparedness to participate in financial life, including the business sphere. Implications for Central European audience: Assuming that the gender differences in financial literacy and behaviour can be explained on the grounds of the social identity theory, Central and Eastern Europe may differ from Western Europe in terms of the gender gap. Socially-imposed gender roles were presumably shaped differently behind the Iron Curtain, which resulted in that the distinction between masculine and feminine roles got blurred under the Soviet regime. As a result, the absence of gender differences in financial behaviour is more likely to occur in Central and Eastern European countries. Financial education initiatives should take this circumstance into account. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Most of peer-to-peer (P2P) online borrowers are small business managers. Learning behavior of them is under-analyzed in the literature of P2P online lending. Using a large sample from one of the China’s largest online P2P lending marketplaces- renrendai.com, we examine whether a borrower in the P2P lending market has a learning behavior when he/she bids interest rates for a loan. We validate the existence of learning behavior in the interest rate bidding, in which they learn from the previous experience and adjust the interest rates downward, so that they can obtain finance at a lower cost. Further analysis shows the heterogeneity across gender and education. We find that female borrowers and highly educated borrowers are more effective in the learning process. Robustness check further supports our hypothesis. Our findings point to the importance of providing financial education for groups of low education level. Managerial implications are discussed. © 2021 City University of Hong Kong and National Taiwan University.

AB  - In the early 1990s, Former Eastern Bloc countries, including Hungary, experienced a broad transition from centrally-planned economies, managed by party-state bureaucracies, to privatised economies. Throughout the market liberalisation process, the Hungarian market embraced entrepreneurship as a mechanism for generating both private wealth and economic growth, despite a lack of experience and know-how in business management and financial education, made largely unavailable by the communist regime for more than 40 years. On these grounds, several Eastern European countries experienced the rise of Ponzi schemes. The Hungarian earthworm pyramid can serve as an interesting example of the financial pyramids that evolved during the transition of economies. However, some of the characteristics of the Hungarian earthworm pyramid suggest that it was a rather unique case when compared to other Eastern European pyramids during the economic transition period of post-communist nations. Our study concludes that, under different political and economic circumstances, the Hungarian bio-humus production by earthworms could potentially become a profitable venture, rather than a source for financial and societal damages. © 2021 Elad Harison et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - This research examines the impact of an external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, an internal locus of control, and social media on financial well-being, focusing on the mediating role of financial behavior. Financial wellbeing can be improved by reducing the external locus of control, increasing individual financial self-efficacy and financial literacy, and using social media appropriately. Furthermore, the importance of financial behavior is emphasized by the indirect effects of external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, and social media on financial wellbeing. The study features an online survey questionnaire with 438 respondents. The relationships were investigated using PLS-SEM. According to the study’s findings, financial influencers are social media data variables that significantly affect financial behavior. These findings can assist policymakers, and business leaders in understanding the most influential factors affecting Indonesia’s financial wellbeing. Furthermore, the Indonesian government encourages the younger generation to improve its literacy index through public financial education. Research into financial wellbeing is critical because it aligns with the government’s goal of improving the stability and health of the population’s finances. Individuals can maintain financial control, allowing them to meet financial goals, manage unexpected expenses during emergencies, deal with financial problems, and enjoy life. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Traditional approaches to managing and leading in entrepreneurial systems, founded on traditional, reductionist and linear thinking, could have issues coping with the inherent uncertainties, complexity and dynamics of such circumstances. Entrepreneurial leadership is acknowledged as an important competency that entrepreneurs could adopt to enhance their leadership development and competitive and sustainable growth for their businesses. Aim: This research study sought to evaluate leadership challenges that affect the performance and the Gauteng province’s small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) sustainability. Setting: This study focuses on SMMEs in the Gauteng province. Methods: In this qualitative study, a systems dynamics approach was used to explore the impact of the various leadership problems and dynamics influencing the SMME performance in the Gauteng province. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 46 entrepreneurs, followed by creating causal loop diagrams to understand how system variables and components produce behaviours in interactive patterns within the entrepreneurial system. Results: Findings of the study revealed that SMMEs consistently suffer from relatively high levels of failures and lower performance levels caused by: (1) a lack of entrepreneurial leadership skills, (2) a lack of financial resources and/or finances, (3) a lack of financial education, (4) infrastructure constraints, (5) a lack of training, (6) a lack of technology and (7) crime and corruption. Conclusion: This study highlights that the entrepreneurial context in South Africa is dynamic and complex in nature and is limited by entrepreneurial leadership capabilities and a weak understanding of the business environment. Contribution: This study employs a system dynamics approach that entrepreneurs can use to understand and solve important, complex socio-economic and sustainability problems that they encounter. © 2023.

AB  - This paper suggests the use of Russian proverbs related to money to engage Russianspeaking students in the business classroom. Russian proverbs enhance teaching by appealing to Russian students’ cultural background, by presenting ideas in a concise and memorable way, and by creating a friendlier classroom environment. Russian proverbs also assist English-speaking instructors to break down language barriers and to develop a close relationship with students. The use of Russian proverbs benefits non-Russian speaking students by promoting cultural and language diversity in the business classroom as well. The paper proposes 61 Russian proverbs to explain 33 financial concepts and 4 general learning concepts. A short description of each financial concept is accompanied with phonetic and literal translation of related Russian proverbs and an equivalent English proverb. Teaching strategies for incorporating Russian proverbs in the classroom are presented as well. © 2019 NeilsonJournals Publishing.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic affects the economy of a country as well as its Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The MSMEs contribute to the economy of a country's GDP and can engross the workforce. In the case of Indonesia, 99% of MSMEs are micro-and small-businesses that need an intervention program from the Government. Having Accounting skills is important to manage MSMEs, as indicated by the OECD report (2017) regarding financial education. Unfortunately, the level of education that the owners of micro to small businesses have is relatively low and therefore, the program should be developed carefully considering the educational background of the sector. Training these business owners on simple accounting skills, which are critically important such as cash in and out records, may be suitable for micro and small businesses. In addition, recognition of their existence is also important by providing them with a business certificate from the city council. The certificate can also be used as a basis to allocate temporary space for the business that does the trading in the street market. Having the certificate recorded and maintained by the city council, as well as the simple financial record, can be used by the Government to base intervention programs such as financial and skill training as well as access to financial support or loan.3. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

AB  - Purpose - The paper describes the test of preexistent scales to measure behaviors of personal financial management, buying impulsiveness and financial strain Design/methodology/approach - From the back translation of scales published in English, empirical research was carried out to certify the reliability and validity of these instruments. A survey through the internet was performed with 195 respondents (postgraduate students and teachers from five Brazilian states, related to business administration courses). Data were analyzed with exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, in addition to structural equation modeling, using the statistical software IBM SPSS and AMOS. Findings - The scales are reliable and showed construct validity. In the examination of scales’ nomological validity, there is a negative association between buying impulsineness and financial management. Financial manegement this construct has a negative effect on financial strain, and partially mediates the positive relationship between impulsiveness and financial strain. Originality/value - Results motivate the use of a scales of the behavior of personal financial management in order to evaluate this trait of personal competence, supporting programs of financial education and the marketing planning of credit institutions. © 2019, Fundacao Escola de Comercio Alvares Penteado.

AB  - Purpose: Financial literacy is generally seen as an important factor explaining a broader set of investment behaviors. In the context of a weak financial knowledge in France, this article focuses on the particular situation of Generation Z (individuals born after 1995) and more particularly management students likely to be involved in financial decisions in the near future. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a survey conducted in the Fall of 2019, through a questionnaire distributed to 300 students enrolled in a French business school. Findings: The results indicate that financial knowledge is poor for students who do not follow a specialized course in finance. This research also demonstrates the importance of risk behavior, showing that risk adverse students are also those with the lowest level of financial literacy. Originality/value: This article contributes to the academic literature by focusing on students in France. It is the first study to examine Gen Z financial literacy and its implications. It raises awareness on the importance of financial education in the education curriculum. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The primary motive of this paper is to examine the determinants of financial inclusion in Tanzania. The paper borrows data from a household survey conducted by TWAWEZA. Employing the probit regression, the findings of this paper reveal that gender, education, age and income are the pertinent factors which affect the financial inclusion in Tanzania. The paper further shows the following: First, if you are a man, financially stable, have a good education and are relatively older, you then stand better chances of being financially included. The results show that, as the level of education increases, the individual is more likely to be financially included. The possible reason for this observation may be clearly linked with the financial ability of educated individuals to afford holding bank accounts and presenting personal guarantees when required by the banks during loan application because the level of education goes parallel with the income level. In addition, the results confirm a gender gap in formal financial inclusion, and this may be due to the factors such as inability of women to show collateral, their poor financial education awareness and lower business experience. Second, the paper also shows that the factors which affect traditional banking services are the same as those affecting mobile banking services (gender, age, income and education), and that there is a negative trend and a clear departure of customers' usage from banking retail services to mobile financial services. Although this gap has been narrowed recently, the best option with the banking sector is to create more new delivery channels while using mobile financial services as an infrastructure to deepen financial access reaching more un-banked population. The paper, therefore, recommends banks to create more delivery channels while using mobile telecommunication network as an infrastructure to deepen financial access reaching more unbanked people rather than competing with mobile network operators. The findings of this paper may also be used as a wake-up call for policy makers to put more emphasis on women and young people who are often left behind during Government's effort toward reaching the entire population as far as financial inclusion is concerned. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The contagious COVID-19 pandemic has been considered a massive global crisis since World War II and has disturbed business and economic activities across the globe. The current study examined the reaction of the stock market’s to the outbreak of COVID-19, considering the extreme inter-day movements in the Indian stock market. The extreme inter-day movements in S&P CNX Nifty-50 have been identified during the study period from January 2020 to December 2021 and further classified into decline and gain events based on positive and negative announcements related to COVID-19. The study utilized an event study approach and panel regression for empirical investigation. The results of the event study analysis illustrate that the significant abnormal loss ranges from 12.86% to 2.47% for the major decline events and significant abnormal return from 8.43% to 3.23% for the gain events. The regression analysis results showed that real return and Central Bank Policy rate have a considerable impact on the abnormal returns during COVID-19. The study’s findings are helpful to policy implications that identified the need to focus on financial education and strengthen the health and finance-related policies to deal with such pandemics in the future. © 2023 MDI.

AB  - The study examines the influence of the five pillars of inclusive financing on the empowerment of micro-, smalland medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and the influence of institutional conditions on the empowerment of MSMEs. This study uses primary and secondary data. The population of the study are MSMEs; the is a total of 930,620 MSMEs in Jakarta. Owners of micro-, smalland medium-sized enterprises is a good population to be measured because they are the main actors that know exactly the challenges and the obstacles in doing business addressing problems faced in inclusive financing, which is related to the purpose of the study. The research borrows from finance and entrepreneurial theories for model design. The results of the study show that all the variables are significant and positive in the efforts to finance MSMEs in Indonesia, which means that financial education plays an important role in the sustainability of financial inclusion. The financial theory, developed to explain financing at the company level, needs to be adapted to the entrepreneurial situation, so that it can explain the behavior of small businesses. This means that, with correct financial knowledge, financial inclusion plays an important role in the sustainability of MSMEs in Indonesia. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

AB  - Improving economic resources of impoverished youth may alter intentions to engage in sexual risk behaviors by motivating positive future planning to avoid HIV risk and by altering economic contexts contributing to HIV risk. Yet, few studies have examined the effect of economic-strengthening on economic and sexual behaviors of orphaned youth, despite high poverty and high HIV infection in this population. Hierarchal longitudinal regressions were used to examine the effect of a savings-led economic empowerment intervention, the Suubi-Maka Project, on changes in orphaned adolescents cash savings and attitudes toward savings and HIV-preventive practices over time. We randomized 346 Ugandan adolescents, aged 10-17 years, to either the control group receiving usual orphan care plus mentoring (n = 167) or the intervention group receiving usual orphan care plus mentoring, financial education, and matched savings accounts (n = 179). Assessments were conducted at baseline, 12, and 24 months. Results indicated that intervention adolescents significantly increased their cash savings over time (b = $US12.32, ±1.12, p <.001) compared to adolescents in the control group. At 24 months post-baseline, 92% of intervention adolescents had accumulated savings compared to 43% in the control group (p <.001). The largest changes in savings goals were the proportion of intervention adolescents valuing saving for money to buy a home (ΔT1-T0 = +14.9, p <.001), pursue vocational training (ΔT1-T0 = +8.8, p <.01), and start a business (T1-T0 = +6.7, p <.01). Intervention adolescents also had a significant relative increase over time in HIV-preventive attitudinal scores (b = +0.19, ±0.09, p <.05), most commonly toward perceived risk of HIV (95.8%, n = 159), sexual abstinence or postponement (91.6%, n = 152), and consistent condom use (93.4%, n = 144). In addition, intervention adolescents had 2.017 significantly greater odds of a maximum HIV-prevention score (OR = 2.017, 95%CI: 1.43-2.84). To minimize HIV risk throughout the adolescent and young adult periods, long-term strategies are needed to integrate youth economic development, including savings and income generation, with age-appropriate combination prevention interventions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The poor performance of female entrepreneurs, exemplified in their inability to realize their full potential and compete fairly with their male counterparts owing to financial illiteracy, motivated this study. Therefore, this study examined the effect of financial literacy on business performance among female micro-entrepreneurs. Using the survey research design, data were collected from 247 female entrepreneurs from six states in the North-Eastern region of Nigeria. The hypotheses developed for the study were tested using path modeling-structural equation modeling with the aid of SmartPLS software version 3.2.7. The result revealed that all proxies of financial literacy (financial education, cash forecasting, and bookkeeping have significant effects on business performance of female entrepreneurs. Additionally, the paper revealed that financial education contributed more to the variance in business performance of the female micro- entrepreneurs, this was followed by bookkeeping practices, while cash-forecasting has the least effect on the variance in business performance. This implies that financial education is essential for the success of female micro-entrepreneurs. Thus, this study advocates the need for continuing trainings and workshops for female microentrepreneurs on financial concepts such as bookkeeping, cash forecasting, and market volatilities. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

AB  - Introduction: Cash transfers have been promoted as a means to reduce HIV risk for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in sub-Saharan Africa. One of the main mechanisms whereby they are hypothesized to reduce risk is by deterring transactional sex. In this paper, we use qualitative methods to explore participant experiences, perspectives and reported behaviours of a cash transfer plus financial education programme among out of school, 15- to 23-year-old AGYWs in rural Tanzania with a focus on partner choice and transactional sex. Methods: We conducted 60 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and 20 narrative timeline interviews with participants of the PEPFAR DREAMS Sauti/WORTH+ cash transfer programme between June 2017 and July 2018. Interviews were taped, transcribed and translated from Kiswahili to English. Transcripts were coded and analysed for key themes. Results: We found that participants in a cash transfer plus programme discussed behaviours that could reduce HIV risk through decreasing their dependence on male sex partners. There appeared to be two main mechanisms for this. One, young women discussed the cash transfer providing for basic needs (e.g. food, toiletries) which appeared to reduce their dependence on male sex partners who previously provided these goods (e.g. transactional sex). This experience was more pronounced among the poorest participants. Two, young women discussed how the financial education/business development aspect of the programme empowered them to refuse some sex partners; unmarried women discussed these experiences more than married women. Social support from family and programme mentors appeared to strengthen young women's ability to successful start businesses, produce income and thus be less dependent on partners. Conclusions: The cash transfer programme may have reduced AGYW engagement in transactional sex that occurred to meet basic needs (one form of transactional sex). The financial education/business development and mentorship elements of the programme appeared important in building AGYW agency, self-esteem and future orientation which may support AGYWs in refusing unwanted sex partners. Future cash plus programmes should consider adding or strengthening financial education and job skills training, mentorship and future orientation to see stronger and perhaps sustainable outcomes for HIV prevention. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe how librarians used elements of market research, advertising and media literacy in a personal finance class. Design/methodology/approach: Librarians each semester guest lecture one session in a personal finance class “Foundations of Money Education.” Through this class, librarians present engaging material about market research and advertising in an effort to encourage students to think about how these external forces influence their spending behavior. Findings: Students appreciate learning about advertising through the engaging use of commercials. While responses were mixed as to the applicability of the topic, the majority of students agreed that the topic was a worthwhile addition to the personal finance curriculum. Originality/value: Topics such as budgets, savings, and mortgages are typically taught in personal finance classes. Teaching information about market research and advertising is a topic that is usually not covered in a personal finance class. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose – In an introductory finance course, business school students often report difficulty in dealing with several variables and regression equations in testing the forward market efficiency and its relevant hypotheses: forward rate unbiasedness, rational expectations, risk neutrality and homogeneous expectations. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Although each of these hypotheses may be relatively easy to understand one by one, it is harder to see their linkages. Thus, the author develops the loop diagram for supplementing traditional instruction methods. Findings – The author finds that a significant majority of students prefer the loop diagram approach. Furthermore, students using loop diagram display more understanding of the forward market efficiency than those with access to a conventional instruction. Originality/value – The loop diagram provides students a simple visual aid for formulating a complete set of regressions and enables them to analyze a richer set of relationships between several hypotheses than what they typically see in finance textbooks. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of financial and technical education of chief executive officer (CEO) on investment–cash flow sensitivity (ICFS) of Indian manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the dynamic panel data model and more specifically, the system-generalized method of moments (GMM) technique to investigate the effect of CEOs' education on ICFS of Indian manufacturing firms during the period 1998–1999 to 2016–2017. Findings: The study shows that financial (technical) education of CEOs does (not) affect ICFS. The results explain that the role of the CEO's education in ICFS is highly significant during the crisis period. The robustness test depicts that the influence of financial education on ICFS is less (more) for group-affiliated and large-sized firms (stand-alone and small-sized firms). Further, the CEO's education is significantly associated with corporate investment decisions. Research limitations/implications: Due to the unavailability of the CEO's compensation data for the selected sample, future research could explore the impact of CEO's education with respect to CEO's compensation on ICFS. Practical implications: First, the authors find that financially educated CEOs affect ICFS; therefore, firms should take care of CEO's education during recruitment of CEOs. Second, lending agencies should also consider the educational background of the CEO before approval of funding to make it safe. Third, investors should keep in mind the educational background of the CEO for the growth of their investment as it may be easier for financially educated CEOs to borrow from the market at the time of requirement. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence through analyzing the impact of a CEO's education on ICFS in the context of India. This study is very unique in itself as it uses the sample of manufacturing sectors of India, which are growing very fast and attracting global investors to create a global hub of manufacturing in India. This study also considers different types of education such as financial and technical education of CEOs in the context of a developing economy like India. This study made its findings robust across company characteristics and periods based on the financial crisis. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to examine an instrument designed to measure an individual’s spiritual capital. Spiritual capital represents a relatively new concept that relates to one’s relationship to financial resources such that he or she exhibits dispositions and behaviors toward justice-oriented environments. This study served to interpret the factor structure of Rima’s measure, consider differences in spiritual capital levels based on student area of study, and explore the influences on measures of students’ spiritual capital. The importance of this study relates to its interpretation of a measure for spiritual capital and its providing of information about an effort to quantify a concept largely considered abstract and intangible. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine challenging factors in accessing finance by female microentrepreneurs in Anambra state, Nigeria. This study employed both qualitative and quantitative methods in data collection. Multi-stage sampling technique was adopted in selecting the sample, and the data analyzed using logit regression model based on the binary choice that describes the probability of women micro entrepreneur’s choice between two mutually exclusive alternatives (accessing or not accessing microcredit). The study identifies fear of default, lack of collaterals, inability to get guarantors and information asymmetry as main factors challenging women’s access to finance. The study recommends, among others, the need for financial education for female micro entrepreneurs. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Using NARDL model and Hatemi-j-asymmetric causality test, this work scrutinizes the asymmetric interactions between income inequality and financial development in India. The empirical findings support the existence of asymmetric structures in the finance-inequality nexus. It is found that negative shocks in financial development ameliorate income inequality while as, positive shocks in financial development exacerbate income inequality in an asymmetric manner. Wald's test and asymmetric cumulative dynamic multipliers used in the study also lend credence to the presence of asymmetric structures in the finance-inequality relationship demonstrating the robustness of our estimates. Furthermore, asymmetric causality tests reveal a unidirectional asymmetric causality between positive shocks in financial development and income inequality. The study divulges need to account for asymmetry in finance–inequality which previous studies neglected. National strategies for financial education, financial inclusion for unbanked segments of the population by expanding financial services network to hitherto unbanked areas, tailoring of financial products and services as per the specific needs of people, reducing interest rates on loans to businesses that qualify as small and medium enterprises must be among the top priorities of policy makers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The current study explores the relationship between contextual hardships and women's career calling. We examine how the formation of career calling drive is linked to how an individual perceives and affectively reacts to forms of oppression within and across institutional subsystems. In conceptualizing career calling formation, we attempt to broaden our understanding of this concept to include external and negative contextual factors. Our core argument holds that the perception and experience of contextual hardships play a key role in the formation of career calling. Based on 20 in-depth qualitative interviews with successful women in Lebanon whose work fits the scholarly definition of career calling, our findings show that these women's career narratives are constructed in close relation to perceptions of oppression (i.e., violence, marginalization, powerlessness, exploitation and cultural imperialism) experienced across the political, financial, education and labor, and culture subsystems. Taken together, our main findings demonstrate that experiences of negative and external contextual hardship elicit affective responses that foster a career calling drive. Our findings help bridge the neoclassical and modern approaches to career calling by showing the important role that external sources can play in driving the internal formation of career calling. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: Knowledge of spreadsheet tools like Microsoft Excel is a valuable skill to have in today’s job market. The preliminary assessment of a group of business school students shows that most of them struggle to perform simple tasks in a spreadsheet. The purpose of this paper is to propose using student tutors to teach these skills. Design/methodology/approach: The authors identify students proficient in Excel as tutors and organize one-on-one peer tutoring lessons. The authors compare the Excel competency level of students prior to and after the tutoring sessions. Findings: The results suggest that most students with minimal Excel skills significantly improve their competency level after tutoring. Originality/value: The proposed hands-on approach appears to be effective in helping students acquire basic Excel capabilities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Financial education can help reduce social exclusion and develop people economically. Knowing basic financial concepts allows people to make appropriate savings, expenses, and investment decisions. The objective of this research is to measure the level of financial education of students of a private university in Lima, the capital of Peru, who have already received formal instruction in finance-related topics. A total of 365 university students from the sixth to the tenth semester of Business school were surveyed. Financial education was measured following the methodology applied by three institutions (FINRA, CONDUSEF, and Banamex-UNAM) to evaluate the knowledge that young people have about the dimensions: savings, interest rates, inflation, credit card use, and budgeting. The results show that young people are knowledgeable about budgeting; they know about saving, but not in terms of economic security; likewise, inflation, interest rates, and credit cards are topics that they still need to pay more attention to and take care of. It was concluded that the level of knowledge on financial topics of the students of the private university under study is low because they do not manage to apply all the knowledge acquired in class as part of their daily habits. In this sense, it is emphasized that the State should include more related courses in the curriculum of basic education, a recommendation that was also mentioned in similar research.

AB  - In the last decade, developed and emerging economies have become increasingly aware of the importance of ensuring that their citizens are financially literate. Eighteen countries and economies, including 13 OECD countries, participated for the first time in 2012 on the financial literacy assessment of 15-year-old students. Financial literacy scores varied according to the participating countries, and they were determined by factors related to the teaching-learning process, especially those related to the delivery of financial education in schools. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the provision of financial education in the school curriculum across all the countries that participated in PISA 2012—data from 2015 did not allow such analysis. We measured the direct effect of different ways of financial education delivery on students' financial literacy scores, after controlling for math and reading performance, and individual characteristics of students and their schools. The majority of the countries have introduced financial education topics in the curriculum somehow. But only in the Flemish Community of Belgium, the United States, and Latvia—and to a lesser extent in Australia, Estonia, France, Israel, Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, and the Slovak Republic—the way how financial education (FE) is delivered is positively correlated with students' financial literacy scores: FE taught as part of business or economics courses in Belgium, FE taught as part of a cross-curricular subject in the U.S., and FE taught as part of mathematics in Latvia. Our main findings pose fundamental challenges for educational policy regarding school-based FE. The first is to decide at what age (grade) interventions should be introduced into the education system so that students are not only financially literate but also financially competent. The second is to devise instructional approaches that more effectively lead young people to put pertinent financial knowledge into practice and to do so correctly when they make financial decisions. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study analysed the level of financial literacy among university students in Estonia, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation and Turkey. The purpose of the study was to determine the level of financial literacy among university students, and to find out the relationship between financial knowledge and demographic characteristics of students. Online survey instrument was used to collect data. 409 fully completed questionnaires were accepted for analysis. Logistic regression was used to analyse of impact of the demographic characteristics on financial literacy. Overall mean of correct answers for the survey was 72.2%. This result represents a medium level of financial literacy about personal finance. Results indicate that male students, business major students, PhD students, those who live in a rental house, those whose parents have high level income, those who get advice on financial matters from their friends, those who took financial course before, those who get financial information about financial issues from university education, and students from Poland are more knowledgeable on personal finance. More financial courses should be provided in university education programmes, which could help more students handle their finances better and improve their financial wellbeing. It should be taken into consideration that in recent years, environmental and technological influences on financial literacy may be more important than parental influence. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Financial inclusion plays a crucial role in fostering business growth by facilitating the accumulation of capital and enabling access to investment opportunities for businesses over a period of time. This study aims to examine the financial inclusion of female entrepreneurs in Somalia. The determinants considered in this study are age, education, business longevity, the form of the business, and the type of the business. A cross-sectional research design was employed in this study to gather data from a sample of 385 female entrepreneurs situated in key urban centers within Somalia. The data collection process involved the administration of a structured questionnaire. Probit regression models were applied for analysis, and the study presents the marginal effect of each individual observation. According to the findings of this study, among the 385 female entrepreneurs surveyed, a notable proportion of 86% reported having a bank account. Additionally, approximately 59% of the participants stated that they saved money in a bank account. However, a relatively smaller percentage of 19% indicated they had received bank loans. Additionally, the study revealed that female entrepreneurs over 30 years are 4% more likely to have a bank account than their younger counterparts. However, young entrepreneurs are 2% more likely to save money in a bank account and 12% more likely to obtain a loan from a bank. Furthermore, the findings of this study indicate that the level of education plays a significant role in determining female financial inclusion. Specifically, female entrepreneurs with a university degree are 1% more likely to have a bank account, 6% more likely to save money in a bank account, and 12% more likely to borrow from a bank compared to those who had only completed secondary school or had not received formal education. This study\s policy implications emphasize the importance of promoting gender-inclusive financial policies, strengthening financial infrastructure, and providing financial education and entrepreneurial skills to create an enabling environment that fosters female entrepreneurs’ financial inclusion and success in Somalia. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Compared with the developed countries such as Britain and America, China’s financial and business education started later without enough attention, especially in the economically backward central and western regions. With the further deepening of China’s reform and opening-up and economic development, the backward finance and business education and the unbalanced regional development are not in line with China’s economic and social development. Therefore, strengthening the financial and business education and further developing the human capital are the urgent tasks of China’s education reform and development, and the universal financial education has been raised to the national strategic level. With the application-oriented colleges and universities in the central region as the object of research, this paper uses the method of questionnaire to explore ways to improve the financial literacy of college students. © 2018 EDAM.

AB  - This study investigated Millennials’ source selection while searching for financial information to improve financial well-being. Results from an online survey of 488 business students at a Western U.S. university showed that Millennials used multiple sources when looking for financial information, but only sources whose perceived attributes fit the seekers’ preferences were considered; respondents favored family, employer/ university, and government sources. Associations between personal characteristics (personal financial well-being, financial issue involvement, financial health self-efficacy, gender, and perception of source attributes) and financial information source selection were examined. Findings suggest financial practitioners, universities, and employers can improve their “fit” as financial information sources for Millennials by cocreating financial information with them, tailoring the communication channels, and enhancing the accessibility of information. © 2018 Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education®.

AB  - This article discusses the Family Office (FO) theme and describes how this organization promotes financial education for future heirs of Brazilian business families. FO is an organization formed by business families to manage and preserve their respective assets. Financial education is related to technical knowledge aimed at managing financial resources. This knowledge should concern the business family that aims to maintain its resources. The research was developed through semi-structured interviews using the thematic analysis technique. The sample includes a total of 19 people interviewed, linked to 10 FOs to whom they had convenient access. The research result identified two types of FO organizations: Single Family Offices (SFO) and Multi-Family Offices (MFO). Seven of the nine SFOs have programs for the financial education of heirs. Two of the five MFOs offer specialized financial education consultancies to their clients. The others manage financial resources. As a result, MFOs have more limited participation in the financial education of heirs. In contrast, SFOs, with more than 10 members, promote financial education, especially by hiring specialized consultants and offering targeted courses, that is, through training and development. The interviewees also emphasized that the knowledge they consider important to be developed for heirs is basic finance, balance sheet analysis, investment management, and family governance. In addition, the first generation of the business family usually has low schooling, while the second generation can already be considered highly educated. This characteristic may have contributed to education being one of the values preserved through the FO. Copyright 2023 With Intelligence LLC.

AB  - Purpose: The main purpose of this study is to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected from the poor who resides in rural Uganda. Structural equation modelling (SEM) through analysis of moment structures (AMOS) was used to analyze the data. Bootstrap approach with 5,000 samples was run to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Findings: The results showed that social network significantly and positively mediate the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. In addition, financial literacy also has a direct significant and positive effect on financial inclusion. Overall, the findings suggest that the presence of social network fully mediate the effect of financial literacy on financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Research limitations/implications: This study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Future studies could adopt longitudinal research design to establish the dynamic characteristics of the samples under study over time. Besides, this study collected data from only poor households who were clients of microfinance banks located in rural Uganda. It ignored the other section of the population who were not the poor. Therefore, future studies could use the other section of the population who are clients of commercial banks. Practical implications: The advocates of financial literacy and managers of microfinance banks in developing countries should ensure using existing local structures such as community and village associations to conduct financial literacy training. The village associations help in mobilizing members who are close-knit based on the existing societal ties that can be used as a channel for disseminating vital financial literacy information. Indeed, financial literacy workshops, seminars, and business clinics can be easily conducted to individuals who are members of the village associations. Originality/value: This paper integrates social network theory in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Social network acts as a conduit through which financial knowledge and skills flow to increase the scope of financial inclusion of the poor in developing countries. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The article substantiates the importance of high level of financial literacy of management personnel for professional fulfillment of tasks of ensuring financial and economic security of economic entities. Strategic management of all, without exception, directions of economic activity of enterprises in the conditions of expansion of models of knowledge economy and information economy, will not have the necessary effect without the proper human resources. The development of this hypothesis made it possible to identify problems in the education system that impedes the acquisition of the necessary knowledge and skills by future managers. The authors offer a step-by-step financial education model to train financial and economic security professionals focused on achieving the strategic goals of companies in the risk-filled business environment. © Allied Business Academies.

AB  - Using a multilevel analysis with data from PISA 2012, we find that the differences in financial literacy of 15-year-old students are explained by both individual and school characteristics. This paper finds that the financial education is positively related to students’ financial literacy scores when it is taught as a cross-curricular subject and as part of business or economics courses, and to a lesser extent as part of mathematics and as an extracurricular activity. Also, math and reading abilities, and holding a bank account and a prepaid debit card, contribute positively to the development of financial literacy, while financial unfamiliarity contributes negatively. © 2018 Mohr Siebeck.

AB  - Building a common EU framework for sustainable finance undoubtedly implies the integration of sound and sustainable processes and skills across the whole structure and governance of financial institutions. Consequently, a new financial paradigm is going to be needed, which will require the strengthening of investor care and protection, so contributing to the restoration of trust in the financial sector. In particular, on 18 December 2018, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) launched two public consultations on draft technical advice for the integration of sustainability risks and factors into the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (MiFID), the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), and the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) regimes, with the aim to clarify the so-called fiduciary duties and to increase transparency in the financial services industry. However, the success of the EU initiatives on investor protection regulation may be seriously endangered by the existence of many challenges, weaknesses, and contradictions raised by economists and stakeholders in relation to the definition of sustainability, ESG data availability and reliability, the development of an EU taxonomy, conflicts of interest, product governance, and suitability assessment. This paper starts by briefly analyzing the recent developments of the regulation of sustainable finance at the global level, then offers a more detailed view on the establishment of a common regime on sustainable finance in the EU, with particular reference to the action plan 'Financing Sustainable Growth'. Then, it examines the recent proposals for regulation on sustainable finance, specifically considering the barriers to the integration of sustainability risks and factors in the EU investor protection regulation-with particular reference to investment services-with respect to its four main dimensions: (1) disclosure of product information, (2) conduct of business (COB) rules, (3) product governance and intervention, and (4) financial education. The paper concludes that the EU reforming proposals, though admirable, risk oversimplifying a complex issue that cannot be easily solved without considering its practical implications on each category of financial operators in the performance of different financial services. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Field experimental evidence from the Philippines regarding financial education and financial access for transnational households is presented and discussed. Recent research in the economics of migration has documented several beneficial impacts of remittance flows on household well-being and investments. Households in the Philippines experiencing exogenous increases in remittances become more likely to leave poverty status, send their children to school, and invest in entrepreneurial enterprises. Researchers provide evidence regarding the potential interaction between two types of interventions that are commonly carried out with transnational households by governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The first type of intervention is financial education for transnational household members. Empirically, financial education has been shown to be associated with the quality of financial decision-making in both observational and randomized experimental studies in developed-country con texts. Randomized studies of the impact of financial education interventions have been carried out in developing-country populations, and several find impacts on the business practices of microentrepreneurs, while impacts on household and individual decision-making are more muted.

AB  - Low business outlook due to poor financial decisions among students has continued to attract interest of financial educators and professionals. Previous studies have interrogated financial literacy with sparse attention given to business risk-taking among students' start-ups in Nigeria. This research gap forms the basis of this study. The aim of this paper is the interrogation of financial knowledge and financial behavior as a lever for business risk-taking among start-up students of the University of Lagos, Nigeria. The philosophical perspective drew insight from the positivist approach with a random sampling of 145 final-year students selected from the departments of Business Administration, Accounting and Employment, and Labour Relations of the Faculty of Management Sciences. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and Bartlett's test were conducted to determine sample adequacy. Regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. The results show that financial knowledge and behavior of start-ups revealed a high propensity to be engaged in business risk-taking (β = .407, t (511) = 7.556, p < 0.05; β = .412, t (1.511) = 7.525, p < 0.05) with males showing more financial literacy understanding for business risk than females (β = .591, t (2;510) = 4.381, p < 0.05; β = .280, t (2;510) = 2.217, p = 0.262) respectively. The findings show the need for the continuous development of students' start-up behavioral and attitudinal disposition, especially females in becoming more financial literate for appropriate financial decision-making in business risk-taking and venture creation. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

AB  - Financial literacy empowers consumers to make more informed financial decisions, including investing in mutual funds. In this study, the sociodemographic profile of working adults with low investment literacy vis-à-vis high investment literacy are examined first. Next, the impact of investment literacy and risk tolerance on the likelihood of investing in mutual funds are explored. Among a sample of 260 working adults comprising mainly of Masters of Business Administration (MBA) students from a leading public higher institution in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the study shows that those with Business/Economics education backgrounds have the highest investment literacy and are more likely to invest in mutual funds compared to individuals from the Arts and other miscellaneous backgrounds. Although Muslims are the least literate in investment matters, they are more likely to hold mutual fund investments relative to those who profess Christianity and Hinduism. Individuals with relatively high income and occupational levels have relatively higher investment literacy. Risk tolerance does not influence the likelihood of investing in mutual fund investments. Policymakers should focus on females, those with Arts education background, Muslims, and those from the lower income/employment ranks to increase their investment literacy through financial education workshops. Mutual fund companies may consider embarking an aggressive knowledge sharing videos related to mutual funds via non-mainstream media such as social media to increase the penetration of mutual fund investments, among the untapped markets. © 2020, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

AB  - Background and aim: Financial literacy (or financial competence) has become an internationally relevant and highly regarded topic. Since people often lack sufficient financial competence, in many countries efforts have been made to foster formal financial education. Less attention, however, has been paid to whether informal learning using information available on the Internet can also support the development of financial competence. However, this seems to be an important question because the Internet has expanded the opportunities for informal learning. In addition, people need to acquire financial competence on their own because not every financial topic relevant in one’s lifetime is covered in formal education syllabi. Against this background, in this study we tested whether people are able to develop financial competence by learning informally using information available on the Internet. We focused on mortgage loans, as they are comparatively complex financial products. Mortgage loans have the potential to significantly influence an individual’s financial situation. In addition, society might carry the burdens of risky and uninformed decisions about mortgage loans—as the financial and real estate crisis has shown. Method: 45 students of economics and business studies in their final undergraduate year participated. They were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental group explored information about mortgage loans using the loan calculator of a German bank. The control group did not explore webpages. Before the intervention, students from both groups completed knowledge tests and self-assessed their financial knowledge and behaviour. After the intervention, students had to work on a case and to decide whether a small family should take out a mortgage loan for financing a house. The decision had to be justified. In addition, students were administered an immediate and delayed knowledge test. Results and conclusions: Students of both groups did not differ in knowledge acquisition, decision making about taking a mortgage loan and argumentation quality. However, prior knowledge can be referred to in order to explain the results. Therefore, informal learning using the Internet did not seem to be effective if people did not have sufficient prior knowledge. This result underlines, on the one hand, the necessity of financial education—be it prior to informal learning or in the course of informal learning. On the other hand, the results can be interpreted as a hint to consider how to improve informal learning activities, e.g. by supporting self-regulation or by improving information material. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - A randomized experiment among poor entrepreneurs tested the impact of exogenously inducing higher financial aspirations. In theory, raising aspirations could have positive effects by inducing higher effort, but could also reduce effort if unmet aspirations lead to frustration. Treatment resulted in more ambitious savings goals, but nearly all individuals fell far short of reaching these goals. Two years later, treated individuals had not saved more, and actually had lower borrowing and business investments. Treatment also reduced belief in the amount of control over one's life. Setting aspirations too high can lead to frustration, leading individuals to reduce their economic investments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper is not an indictment of Black banks and financial institutions, but it pre-sents the difficulties and failures of such minority businesses. Unfortunately, some African Americans are naïve when it comes to banking, primarily because of a lack of financial literacy; and such education is not taught in our schools. Of course, financial education is the key for Black patrons who have never had a bank account. Whether this means that African Americans should only bank with Black financial institutions is important to understand, because of the racial disparities and flat-out discrimination when it comes to banking credit and providing business, home, and personal loans to Black banking clientele. In this regard, traditional white banks in the United States simply upset the financial apple-cart, to use the metaphor, when it comes to fairly deal-ing with Black people—that is, lending to Black entrepreneurs and legitimate borrow-ers. With the failure of Black banks, because of a lack of capital and high net-worth individuals and white investors, it has been extremely hard for many of these venerable institutions to hang-on when providing maximum loan possibilities needed over the years (sometimes more than necessary). © 2022, Polish Academy of Sciences - Institute of Philosophy and Sociology.

AB  - Purpose: Considering the importance of financial literacy (FL) in people’s lives the goal of this study aims to assess the level of FL of young Portuguese students, addressing the impact of the level of education on the FL of college students. Design/methodology/approach: Data from a non-probabilistic sample of 185 students attending higher education bachelor’s and master’s degrees courses in Economics, Management and Marketing was collected between February 25 and March 23, 2019, using an online questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed using IBM SPSS 25 to analyze the data. Findings: The findings show that the level of the degree (bachelor’s or master’s degree) and the academic background of the individual’s parents have a positive impact on FL. Moreover, among individuals with a high level of FL, gender and professional situation are additional predictors. Furthermore, the authors observed that the level of FL of Portuguese students attending higher education is overall low, especially in terms of their knowledge of the main financial concepts, which may call for public policies to be implemented so that to reduce this vulnerability. Research limitations/implications: Among limitations is the limited sample collected, restricted to a particular target, Portuguese students attending business-related courses such as Economics, Management and Marketing, either studying for a master’s or bachelor’s degree. This issue restricts the generalization of the overall findings to other students studying different fields. Future studies can collect a random and representative sample. Practical implications: This study test can be replicated to generate a diagnosis in any region or country, identifying how financially literate the region under analysis is. Also, this can be done to verify the evolution of FL after educational interventions. Social implications: FL is an important competence. In fact, youngsters in the whole world have been suffering from a lack of financial knowledge (FK), and some characteristics of them can push them into indebtedness, and, even bankruptcy, such as a higher level of status consumption, the tendency to have an attitude of self-appraisal, to be self-centered, to seek instant gratification. This study helps to lead to a better understanding of this phenomenon. Originality/value: Addressing college students attending different levels is an add-on to the existing body of literature. This paper contributes to study differences in FL between college and master students, enlightening and evaluating the role of scholarship maturity on financial education. Furthermore, some of the findings challenge the extant knowledge regarding the influence of professional experience, gender and age on the level of FK that students have. Finally, the current approach is innovative as it addresses FK, FL and numeracy in the same study. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The main problem this article addresses is that women are more vulnerable than men in economic terms. The aim of this research is to identify the differences in the destination of savings according to gender and its implications related to their economic rights. Chi-Square tests were performed to test for the existence of statistically significant differences in the destination of men’s and women’s savings, based on the National Survey on the Destination of Savings in Mexico (ENIF). The hypothesis to be tested is that there is a gender difference in the way in which the destination of savings is allocated. As a result, it is possible to see that women focus their savings on issues related to health and education at home, in contrast to men, who tend to protect their own economic future by focusing their savings on remodeling or buying real estate or starting or expanding a business. In this sense, the hypothesis is partially verified in 4 of the 8 savings destinations. This article is motivated by the desire to identify this possible economic gap between genders, considering that it is an issue that affects the economic and personal future of women. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose – This paper evaluates the influence of the institutional environment on the extent of social and environmental disclosure of companies from institutionally distant countries. Design/methodology/approach – We analyze basic materials, oil and gas, and public utility companies with shares traded on the Brazilian stock exchange (BM&FBovespa) and Canadian stock exchange (Toronto Stock Exchange) from 2007 to 2015. Quantitative methods are adopted through descriptive statistics and panel data analysis. The econometric modeling considers environmental and social disclosure as dependent variables, independent variables that represent the political, financial, educational and labor systems, and firm size, ROA, and indebtedness as control variables. Findings – In the case of the companies operating in Brazil, the extent of environmental and social disclosure is positively related to the political and labor systems, and negatively related to the financial system. In Canada, disclosure is negatively influenced by the financial system and the education system. The control variables, which represent characteristics of financial performance, were not significant. Originality/value – The study shows that isomorphic forces operate in the institutional field and affect the adoption of socially responsible behavior. By basing the study on institutionally distinct countries, such as Brazil and Canada, it reinforces the influence of the national business system on the extent of disclosure of environmental and social practices. © 2020, Fundacao Escola de Comercio Alvares Penteado.

AB  - Purpose: Financial education has become an essential component of the economic balance for families, and much is being discussed about the methods, which raise the levels of financial education of the population. Thus, the overall objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of formal and business education on the level of financial education. Design/methodology/approach: This research is characterized as a quasi-experimental study, with undergraduate students. As a data collection technique, a structured questionnaire was used. Findings: The results confirm the importance of formal and business education, as well as gender, for the financial education of individuals. More specifically, being male and having contact with a greater number of financial disciplines increase the level of financial education of the individual. Originality/value: This article demonstrated that the trajectory of the knowledge traversed by individuals within the same level of schooling is of paramount importance. The results show that formal and business education can improve the levels of financial education and reinforce the relevance of strategic actions in this area. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This research seeks the effect of behavioural and non-behavioural factors of SME's owners and their business characteristic on the financing decisions. Moreover, this research categorized SMEs owners based on their behavioural aspects on establishing a behavioural mapping in SMEs industry. The sample of this research is the informal SMEs owners in Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia. In investigating the relationship of the independent variable on financial decision making, this research employed the hierarchical linear multiple regression model (HLMR) and multiple logistic regression (LR). Furthermore, this research employed cluster analysis for building a behavioural mapping in SMEs industry. This study discovered a significant effect of behavioural aspects of SME's owners on the financing decisions, which is, instead of having significant enforcement on the financing decisions, the non-behavioural aspects were more likely impacted on the SMEs owners' investment decisions. The finding shows that there are three significant groups of SMEs owners in the Surakarta region. The result of this research gives key insights, mainly to the involved stakeholder to keep the sustainability of the SMEs industry. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the determinants of owner manager financial self-confidence. In particular, it estimates the effect of bank credit rejection and financial education (FE) on the financial self-confidence of business owners. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses data from 2004 and 2008 surveys of 2,500 UK small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). An ordered probit estimation is used to measure and assess the effect of bank credit rejection and FE variables on financial self-confidence for the two periods. The authors also explore potential differences in self-confidence between males and females. Findings: The results show that outright bank credit rejection reduces financial self-confidence among owner managers whereas partial bank credit rejection is found to help boost confidence prior to the financial crisis. There is strong evidence that FE increases financial self-confidence. Finally, the authors find no association between gender and reported self-confidence in finance. Research limitations/implications: Entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs are encouraged to explore financial literacy and knowledge with a view to increasing their financial self-confidence. This will help SMEs to deal with the banks or other finance providers more efficiently. In addition, better application procedures and information on lending criteria may help SMEs to minimize the probability of bank credit rejection. So the current study has implications for professional bodies as well. The study, however, is restricted to sole proprietor and partnership SMEs and in the UK context only. Practical implications: Financial self-confidence has a progressive effect on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial venture growth. The financial self-confidence of owner managers can support their entrepreneurial capability in starting and operating one or more businesses. As entrepreneurs successfully start and operate their own businesses, they are contributing to economic development through job creation, employment and tax contribution. Originality/value: This paper makes an original contribution in highlighting the usefulness of FE in boosting financial self-confidence among entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs. It is also found that the experience of bank credit rejection reduces entrepreneurs’ financial self-confidence. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Using social construction theory, associations between student and classroom characteristics and high school students' financial knowledge and behavior acquisition after studying a financial planning curriculum were examined. Prior to curriculum study, Whites, those growing up in a farm family business, and those who were working had higher financial knowledge; male and female knowledge differed by content. After curriculum study, females, those not growing up in a farm family business, and those who were not working gained most from curriculum study. While Whites, those who were working, and males exhibited more positive behaviors prior to curriculum study, after curriculum study, students living in states having financial mandates and those who did not grow up in a farm family business increased their positive behaviors most. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Financial consumer protection has been ever strengthened around the world after the Global Financial Crisis. Nonetheless, there occurred mis-selling events that caused massive damage to financial consumers and mis-selling still accounts for the largest proportion of financial consumer disputes and complaints recently filed in Korea. Based on the regulatory framework in Korea, this study aims to explore the microstructure of mis-selling, that is, the major influential factors and their interactions. For this, an analytical model is proposed concerning the suitability principle and explanation duty in financial investment markets. The model consists of three basic components: the types of investors, a financial services company’s objective of profit maximization, and the damage compensation structure set by the regulator. Using the model, the simulation results provide meaningful implications. Strict liability turns out to be effective to prevent mis-selling. The suitability principle is more prone to be violated than the explanation duty and therefore more emphasis should be placed on the former in terms of efficient regulation. Furthermore, this study found a meaningful link between business conduct regulation and financial education, which are the two pillars in financial consumer protection. © 2024 Chul Choi.

AB  - Individual development accounts (IDAs) help low-income families save by providing a savings account and a potential match toward personal savings for specific investments, such as a first home, business capitalization, or postsecondary education and training. The Assets for Independence (AFI) program uses AFI IDAs—commonly coupled with financial education—with the goal of helping low-income households achieve greater self-sufficiency. Using a randomized controlled trial, we evaluate the impact of AFI after one year and find that the median level of liquid assets was $657 higher for the treatment group than the control group (before matching funds). We also find that the treatment (vs control) group experienced less material hardship (by 34%) and was less likely to use nonbank check-cashing services (by 39%). © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Nonprofit organizations and regional universities have increasingly offered professional development opportunities for potential personal finance teachers as states and school districts have increasingly required high school students to take personal finance courses. Yet, current measures on teacher confidence and dispositions shadow these updates. This article employs unique data on high school teachers to estimate their confidence levels, professional development take-up, and attitudes about teaching personal finance courses in schools. The results show that 95% of teachers are confident in teaching personal finance. Teachers with licensure outside of business or economics were more likely to take up professional development in personal finance instruction. Meanwhile, 86% of teachers support a graduation requirement for personal finance instruction in high school. These findings suggest that high schools have the capacity to teach personal finance but also underscore the need for low-cost, easily accessible professional development opportunities. © 2023 Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education.

AB  - Despite their ubiquity in academic and commercial research, evidence of the usefulness of consumer confidence indices is mixed. To contribute to this debate, we examine the psychological mechanisms through which consumer confidence does (and does not) affect consumer behavior. We develop a conceptual model, which we test via structural equation modelling and moderated mediation analysis, using data from a sample of US consumers (n = 1,090). Rather than conceptualize consumer confidence as a single construct, our study is the first to distinguish between national consumer confidence and personal consumer confidence. Consistent with cognitive appraisal theory, personal consumer confidence mediates the relationship between national consumer confidence and perceived financial vulnerability, which in turn leads to increased price conscious behavior. Drawing on attribution theory, we find that external locus of control enhances the effects of national consumer confidence. We provide practical advice to economic forecasters, business analysts, marketers, and financial educators. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study aims at investigating the financial knowledge, financial behaviour and the attitude towards finance amongst on small medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) in Kuching. More specifically on how these powerful factors affect the profitability on fast growing business enterprises in largest city in the Borneo Island over the last decade. The research takes a descriptive approach fitting its underlying pursue and draws interesting conclusions with over 75% response rate. Analysis of the data collected clearly reveals that the knowledge of finance in general relates significantly stronger to the bottom line of these business entities relative to the owners’ financial attitude and their ensuing behaviour towards financial decision making. Therefore, small medium entrepreneurs are highly recommended to participate in financial education on a regular basis to keep them well informed and equipped with the latest ways of managing the finances of their businesses to ensure better financial planning, execution and monitoring of enterprises that inevitably will lead to increased and sustainable earnings. © 2020, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

AB  - In this paper, we examine the impact of financial experience on financial literacy. Exploiting a unique feature of New Zealand, whereby domestic students can obtain interest-free student loans and can fully participate in the national retirement scheme while international students cannot, we employ an instrumental variables approach to identify the causal effect of financial experience on financial literacy. We conduct surveys on a sample of 338 business students and find that there is a positive and causal effect of financial experience on financial literacy. Our results have important implications for financial education programmes and may explain why many of these programmes to date have had limited success. © Cambridge University Press 2013.

AB  - Women’s disadvantage in financial knowledge impedes their progress toward gender equality and produces negative consequences for both individuals and households. To better understand the gender gap in financial knowledge and shed light on possible intervention strategies, this study focused on gender differences in financial knowledge specifically among college students. Drawing on data from the most recent administration of the Study on Collegiate Financial Wellness (SCFW; N = 18,107) among current college students from 38 public four-year institutions, we investigated the gender financial knowledge gap and paid particular attention to the roles of family financial socialization, financial education, and financial behaviors. We identified a sizable gender gap in financial knowledge, even after controlling for other potential factors. OLS regression models and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analyses showed that financial education—indicated by majoring in Business and STEM fields and formal financial courses in high school—was most related to the gender gap in financial knowledge scores. Hands-on financial behaviors were positively associated with financial knowledge acquisition, particularly for female students. In addition, the family socialization process was largely not associated with students’ financial knowledge scores or the gender knowledge gap. Based on these findings, we discussed potential intervention strategies for promoting financial knowledge and reducing the gender gap among and beyond college students. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives are considered “mission critical” objectives within higher education strategic planning processes and by accrediting bodies, particularly at private liberal arts-based institutions. A research gap currently exists with respect to how organized faith, religion, and interfaith dialogue play a pedagogical role in business, particularly when preparing undergraduate students for technical business careers in accounting, finance, and decision sciences. Viewed as the “forgotten DEI” initiative, interfaith dialogue is critical to success at multinational corporations and at the center of employee resource group (ERG) creation. The infusion of interfaith classroom examples, articles, and pedagogy can serve a dual purpose, both preparing undergraduates for careers in technical business disciplines and exposing them to cross-cultural dialogue necessary within multinational companies. This paper describes how religion and interfaith dialogue can be incorporated within the pedagogical design of technical business disciplines to help support DEI initiatives and students preparing for careers in a global world. © 2022, North American Business Press.

AB  - This article offers critical insights into new digital forms of citizen-led journalism. Many communities across western society are frequently excluded from participating in newsgathering and information dissemination that is directly relevant to them due to financial, educational and geographic constraints. News production is a risky business that requires professional levels of skill and considerable finances to sustain. Hence, ‘hyper-localised news’ are often absent from local and national debates. Local news reportage is habitually relegated to social media, which represents a privileged space where the diffusion of disinformation presents a threat to democratic processes. Deploying a place-based, person-centred approach towards investigating news production within communities in Cornwall, UK, this article reflects on a participatory action research project called the Citizen Journalism News Network (CJNN). The CJNN is an overt attempt to design disruptive systems for agenda setting through mass participation and engagement with social issues. The project was delivered within four communities via a twelve-week-long journalism course, and a bespoke online app. CJNN is a platform for citizen journalists to work collaboratively on investigating stories and raising awareness of social issues that directly affect the communities reporting on them. © 2020 by the authors; licensee Cogitatio (Lisbon, Portugal).

AB  - In Hungarian libraries, the development of financial literacy (FL) is either not present at all or is very low in intensity. The Hungarian government strategy does not involve libraries in FL development. Based on the dissemination of information and digital literacy, there are numerous good examples worldwide proving that libraries, reaching all of their users, can effectively take part in financial education and, built thereon, business development and business information services. This can increase their social recognition and even supplement their funding. In 2022, for the first time in the country, the authors conducted a survey among Hungarian librarians to assess the current situation, to identify what hinders the expansion of services related to FL, and what tasks should be performed and what innovations should be introduced in libraries. The survey also seeks to define which fields of competence are to be acquired by librarians. It also reveals the forms of external professional cooperation that are necessary to organise library programmes strengthening financial awareness. The results provide valuable information not only for Hungary, but also internationally, since they showcase the challenges that the library system of a former socialist country in Europe faces after three decades of market economy in this current, market- and profit-oriented world. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - This paper examines the effect of founders' financial education on the quality of financial information provided to investors as well as on the perceived capabilities of the founding team. The examinations are based on a unique sample of 130 international student-run start-ups. This paper finds that founding teams with at least one member having a financial education background provide more useful and specific, however less readable financial information in their business plans. The results suggest that investors regard founding teams comprised of at least one team member with financial education as more capable and competent. This effect stems from investors' screening of team members' biographic information rather than from indirect effects resulting from higher quality financial reporting in business plans. The findings contribute to the existing entrepreneurship education literature by providing empirical evidence that accounting and finance courses should be core elements of entrepreneurship curricula. © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The outbreak of the contagious pandemic Covid-19 has disturbed various economic and business activities across the globe. This has resulted in the declination of cash flows and revenues, which significantly increases the probability of corporate bankruptcies and adversely affects the stock market performance. The current study investigated the Covid-19 and stock market nexus whilst considering the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSX). Covid-19 active cases and deaths have been considered proxies for the Covid-19 from 1 April 2020 to 30 July 2020. For empirical analysis, this study utilised quantile regression and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS). Empirical findings of both quantile regression and DOLS illustrate that both the Covid-19 active cases and deaths significantly decline the SSX closing index. However, the quantile estimates reveal that from lower (0.25) quantile to medium (0.50) to higher (0.75) quantile, the magnitude of these variables is found declining. Moreover, the frequency domain causality test confirmed the unidirectional causal relationship between the study variables, running from Covid-19 cases and deaths to the SSX. The findings are robust, which leads to providing practical policy implications that identified the need to revise health-finance-related policies and financial education to combat such circumstances in the future. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: University students are known to face many challenges in achieving high financial literacy. The purpose of this paper is to examine the level of financial literacy among Malaysian Muslim undergraduates as explained through sociocultural variables. Furthermore, this paper explores a few additional Islamic measurements as part of assessing the level of financial literacy among the students. Design/methodology/approach: The questionnaires were drafted based on a multi-dimensional financial literacy model and distributed conveniently to 330 respondents. Post-interviews were also conducted with selected students to further comprehend the sociocultural context. Findings: The findings suggest that exposing students to financial education and practices influence their financial literacy scores. Students who attended muamalat-related courses demonstrated better financial literacy scores. Meanwhile, post-interview results indicate that the students’ social environment and interactions also play important roles in enhancing their financial literacy. Hence, it is believed that it is essential to embed Islamic-based measurements to equip students with financial literacy in tandem with their pedagogic development. The results thus extend previous studies by confirming the importance of Islamic-based finance- and business-related knowledge for all tertiary students. Furthermore, the curricula should be made compatible to their studying environment and attuned to their values and cultures. Practical implications: The findings suggest the introduction of personal financial and muamalat-based knowledge and practices relative to their Islamic programme orientation. This should take place during the students’ academic years and across all academic programmes’ orientation. The study also highlights the importance of developing special measurements of Islamic financial literacy for Muslims congruent to their distinct Islamic identity. Social implications: The study indicates the importance of high financial literacy among tertiary students for them to have a financially stable future. Originality/value: The research is original in its use of several measurements of financial literacy that embedded Islamic teachings concomitant to the Muslim respondents. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background and Aims: Widows in India face immense challenges through enduring abuse, discrimination, and poor financial opportunities. Whilst there are many nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) undertaking women's empowerment programs, there is a paucity of literature reviewing their impact. Project Sampan, located in Uttarakhand, India, started by helping widows form self-help groups and provides financial education and agricultural skills training as well as group and private counselling. This study aims to evaluate the experiences of participants in the Sampan widows' empowerment program. Methods: This qualitative study involved conducting seventeen semi-structured interviews between February to March of 2021; fifteen with participant widows and two with program facilitators. Widows who were minimum of 18 years of age and had 18 months of involvement were included. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling. Thematic analysis was undertaken to generate common themes relating to the impact of Sampan on the widows, and triangulation of this data was also conducted with observation diaries kept by program facilitators. Results: The evaluation revealed four key themes. Firstly, it was found that the agricultural education Sampan provides changed widows' daily practices, leading to improved produce as well as corresponding sales and an increased opportunity to partake in community business. This has helped improve widows' confidence, agency, and independence. Furthermore, the microfinancing component of the Sampan program was consistently found to be a strength of the project, providing widows with financial security. Their improved productivity and contribution to their communities has led to increased recognition by society, helping to mitigate some of the social stigma surrounding widowhood. The Sampan program has also strengthened solidarity among widows through opportunities to socialise together. Conclusions: This evaluation describes the plight of widows in Uttarakhand, who have been historically excluded and financially vulnerable, but are growing in confidence and emancipation though their involvement in Sampan. This study serves to underscore the existing literature about the discrimination Indian widows face and demonstrate the value of self-help groups in empowering widows. © 2022 Center for Health in Mission.

AB  - Social media is widely recognized as a challenging new communication technology in both economic and social contexts. The present article explores how banks have exploited this technology in the range of consumer retail banking services offered by 100 leading global banks on the three major social networking sites (SNS): Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Viewing social network (SN) banking as a separate delivery channel and offering a working definition of SN banking, the article shows that banks have been more cautious than other businesses in using SNS. The available services are classified on nine main dimensions: marketing, financial education and advice, information support, customer support, sales representativeness, customer engagement, online recruitment, survey and polling, and other services. The scope of these SN banking services is for the most part non-cash-based. Conclusions, implications, and recommendations are discussed and future research priorities are identified.

AB  - Purpose: Strong agreement in the extant business literature emphasizes that digital developments are key to economic growth internationally. This is in spite of the recorded high levels (up to 50 percent) of failure among digital companies and entrepreneurs. The purpose of this paper is to identify the digital debates in Italy, explore current policies and develop a typology that characterizes digital entrepreneurs (DEs) and their start-up companies in Italy. Design/methodology/approach: The digital debates and policies are explored through an extensive telephone survey of the self-perceptions and identified supports required by 348 Italian active DEs. Quantitative statistical techniques were used including factor analysis, cluster analysis and ANOVA, to identify motivations, profiles and critical success factors relevant to the sample. Findings: The study identifies three main clusters among the DEs: emerging very young; emerging business focused and experienced. These clusters vary with the entrepreneurs’ background and competence base, motivation and satisfaction factors. The different kinds of profiles require specific kinds of supporting policies identified by the sample that focus on financial, educational and/or networking provision. Originality/value: The paper affirms the central role of digital entities in modern economies expressed in the current literature and increases knowledge of the perceived success factors identified by DEs. The identification and classification of self-reported characteristics of Italian DEs and to what extent these characterizations might be useful for tailored interventions to support their success are the main contributions of this study. Accordingly, an authentic, original and self-reported portrayal has been constructed of the self-perceptions of Italian DEs. Finally, the study explores the implications for actions and new policies considering self-perceived profiles, needs and expectations of DEs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Romania is in a rather dishonorable position from the financial literacy perspective in the European Union, ranking last among countries. To increase the level of financial education of the Romanian population, public and private institutions, organizations, and companies have recently taken the initiative in this field, mostly after 2015. Our contribution builds on these recent developments and aims at testing the level of basic financial literacy of Romanian university students, enrolled in business and economics studies, using the OECD Financial literacy test. Data was collected through an online survey on a voluntary basis, and the responses were analyzed using statistical indicators. Results indicate a rather high level of financial literacy among students, but also significant differences among respondents that may be explained by several demographic characteristics and specific attributes. The most important characteristics that influence the degree of financial literacy of students are age, students' cycle of studies, the way the students live, property ownership and students' involvement in financial market transactions and contracts. We stress towards the need to act through concrete measures to improve young people financial literacy, as a necessary condition to navigate in an increasingly complex environment, where finance plays an essential role. © 2020 Horobeţ Alexandra et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

AB  - Purpose: Financial communication is an important vehicle toward Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) growth in developing countries, including Tanzania. Financial communication enables various units in the business to understand the available opportunities either for investment or improving investments. From that ground, the study seeks to explore the challenges of financial communication on SMEs growth in Tanzania. To meet this goal three specific objectives were employed: identify the availability of financial communication used by SMEs in Tanzania, explore the financial communication practices used by SMEs in Tanzania and examine the financial communication challenges for developing SMEs in Tanzania. Design/Methodology/ Approach: The study was qualitative in nature and it employed a case study approach as it enables a researcher to retain the holistic and meaningful features. Three cases were selected and studied based on the classification of enterprises. Purposive sampling was employed to select 20 respondents including owners or managers, employees and customers in the respective businesses. The study was conducted in Dar es Salaam City. The instruments used included in-interviews, observation and documents review. Data collected via interview recorded and transcribed by using Express Scribe Transcription Software. Descriptive analysis technique to analyze data collected. Findings: The data obtained show the availability of inadequate financial communication, the presence of both traditional and modern channels of disseminating financial information, limited financial education, cooking of financial records and absence of monthly and quarterly financial statements. All those shortcomings hinder SMEs development in Tanzania to develop and tap business opportunities around them. Practical Implications: Therefore, SMEs should be provided with an appropriate financial education which will help them to see the opportunities around them by having and disseminating appropriate financial information. These results will enable the government to stress on viability of financial information and its effective use in the growth of SMEs. © African Journal of Applied Research Arca Academic Publisher.

AB  - Purpose: The primary aim is to renew academic discourse on financial education in business families. It emphasizes the need for effective financial literacy programs to foster a healthier relationship with money, addressing both technical aspects of finance and its psychological and relational impacts among family members. Design/methodology/approach: This perspective article explores the impact of money education within business families. It discusses the psychological effects of money education on family dynamics and decision-making in family businesses. The research draws on previous studies, surveys and practical examples to highlight the importance of financial education and its implications on family and business sustainability. Findings: Financial education is essential in business families as it enables more meaningful discussions on money and wealth, fostering informed decisions and decreasing conflict. Yet, it is often overlooked. There is a need for academic research into effective strategies for financial education for family members and the effects of financial literacy, or its absence, on various aspects of the business and the family system. The article presents a selection of pertinent questions for future research in this domain. Originality/value: This article contributes to the family business field by underscoring the gap in scholarly research on money education within family businesses. It advocates for comprehensive financial education strategies that balance technical knowledge with an understanding of the psychological and relational aspects of money. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The study focused on the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs at the Galerías Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia, from 2019 to 2023. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the paper is empirical-analytical, focusing on the tangible and unique aspects of reality that can be fragmented for measurement. This approach privileges the use of data from the study population’s experience, which is treated analytically through statistics to establish frequencies and correlations between variables. The research involved a structured questionnaire based on bibliographic references and considering the operational framework of the variables, which underwent expert review, necessary adjustments, a pilot test and subsequent validation in 2019 and 2023. The reliability of the instrument was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, ensuring a reliable indicator when equal to or greater than 0.7 in each analysis period. This methodology aimed to identify practices and how the financial profile influences short term. Findings: The findings from the survey conducted with the microentrepreneurs at Galerías Shopping Center reveal several significant connections to the theoretical framework. The study revealed that many microentrepreneurs relied on their personal funds for business financing, indicating a limited understanding of financial principles. Additionally, a significant portion of microentrepreneurs mitigated investment risk by securing loans from financial institutions, yet none utilized government subsidies like entrepreneurship loans, pointing to a lack of advice. The findings underscore the importance of financial education and suitable financial services for business development. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this study is the lack of detailed data on the financial structure of microentrepreneurs' businesses, as well as specific information on interest rates and the terms and conditions of the microcredit used. These limitations may affect the generalization of the results and the comprehensive understanding of the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs. Future research could include a larger sample size and more accurate data on the financial structure of businesses, as well as a detailed investigation of interest rates and terms and conditions of microcredit, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the financial impacts for microentrepreneurs. Practical implications: The findings of this study have practical implications for microentrepreneurs in the Galerías Shopping Center. The research emphasizes the need for improved financial knowledge, accounting practices and debt management among microentrepreneurs. It also highlights the importance of financial education and access to suitable financial services for business development. The study’s insights can guide the development of training programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing financial literacy and financial management among microentrepreneurs, leading to more informed decision-making and improved financial outcomes. Social implications: From a social perspective, this research contributes to promoting economic development and financial inclusion. By addressing the mismanagement of microcredit by microentrepreneurs and providing insights into their short-term finances, the study aims to foster economic empowerment and sustainable development within communities. The findings underscore the significance of microfinance in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. The research emphasizes the importance of equitable access to financial services, which can contribute to narrowing the gap between the financially excluded population and the conventional financial system. Originality/value: This research adds originality and value to the academic community by addressing the incidence of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs in the specific context of the Galerías Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia. By characterizing the financial profile of microentrepreneurs, establishing the relationship between microcredit characteristics and the financial profile and proposing an action plan, the study provides valuable insights for decision-making in both the academic and microfinance fields. The research contributes to the existing literature on microfinance and financial inclusion, offering a unique perspective and potential solutions for optimizing the use of microcredit-funded resources by microentrepreneurs. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Financing capital investments and working capital have been the key challenges for small businesses during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. Excessive indebtedness can increase the fragility of firms, particularly during times of uncertainty. While there are several programs globally that target entrepreneurs' financial literacy, most of them do not take into consideration entrepreneurs' financial resilience during and after crisis times such as pandemics. The objective of this paper is to discuss the status of financial literacy programs targeting entrepreneurs. This paper conducts a review of the relevant literature to establish the initial understanding and then generates a framework consisting of entrepreneurs' financial literacy along with its components. This is done by carrying out qualitative content analysis of the various financial literacy initiatives targeting entrepreneurs in twenty countries globally to understand their target segments, scope, initiating organisations and limitations. The paper then suggests a framework for entrepreneurs' financial education that takes into consideration financial resilience during and after crisis situations in general and pandemics in particular. © 2023 Malaysian Economic Association.
