TI  - Financial literacy and entrepreneurial risk aversion
T2  - JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - We explore the interaction effects of financial literacy and risk aversion on becoming an entrepreneur. We use two independent datasets to provide evidence that the difference in risk aversion between entrepreneurs and wage earners is conditional on their financial literacy. First, we use the De Nederlandsche Bank's Household Survey and find lower risk aversion only for entrepreneurs with lower financial literacy. The difference disappears for entrepreneurs with higher financial literacy. Second, we show that the results are robust in a fully incentivized field experiment with high-tech startups from three European countries. The results reveal a potential channel of how financial literacy can promote entrepreneurship.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY AND NEW BUSINESS ENTRY
T2  - FINANCIAL INTERNET QUARTERLY
AB  - The issue of the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurship is still not a fully explored research area. On the one hand, there are common views that financial literacy and education in finance are necessary in every individual's life, and that an insufficient level of financial literacy may result in erroneous economic decisions. On the other hand, research on the impact of narrowly defined financial literacy on business start-up decisions is still rare. As a result, there are no clear indications regarding the need for education in the area of finance in order to stimulate entrepreneurial decisions, including the survival of launched economic undertakings. This article deals with the relationship between financial literacy and chosen entrepreneurial aspects such as 1) Phases of Entrepreneurial Activity; 2) Entrepreneurial potential; 3) Motivation; 4) Involvement in the technology sector; and 5) Business exit reasons. All of the above aspects are embedded in the context of financial literacy. The article sheds light on the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurship and creates a background for further attempts to deepen understanding of this issue.

TI  - Does financial literacy drive entrepreneurship in rural China?
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Developing financial literacy is a crucial part of entrepreneurship. It can aid aspiring entrepreneurs to learn how to analyze market trends, formulate business plans, conduct cost accounting activities, and navigate fiscal risks in their businesses. Therefore, we investigated the most recent dataset on rural residents in China to determine the effects of financial literacy on their entrepreneurial behaviors. Our observations reveal that individuals with high financial literacy, that is, those who have attained advanced financial knowledge, are more likely to start a business than those with low financial literacy. We employed instrumental variable analysis to mitigate the endogeneity of financial literacy. Results show a causal relationship between Chinese rural residents' financial literacy and entrepreneurship. Finally, we demonstrate that the aggressive risk attitudes of rural families magnify the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurship.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL LITERACY TENDENCIES WITH YOUNG PEOPLE
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - The following skills, such as planning of personal finances, formation and diversification of savings, augmentations of personal capital, and open-mindedness to new initiatives in the entrepreneurship activities, enhance the financial sustainability of the population, and are decisive for their life quality. Every person in certain circumstances can be financially and economically active, if s/he has got such competence as financial literacy which is much more important in the course of life than the level of income or professional qualifications, because, hereafter the governing factor will be not the possession of financial instruments by the person, but skills of effective management for the achievement of one's own objectives.Knowledge of financial matters at a young age makes administration of finances much easier when becoming adult, getting education, or joining the labor market. At the same time the necessity of improving the financial literacy among young people and educating schoolchildren is more and more discussed. Taking into consideration the fact that young individuals are a significant factor for the development of national economy, substantial improvement of young people's financial literacy is essential. Young people with a high level of financial literacy would be those who could give greater contribution to state economy, so it is important to research the level of financial literacy among young people. The objective of the present research is to analyze the financial literacy of young people in Daugavpils. Methods used in the research: monographic method - theoretical description of financial literacy, graphical method - graphical representation of obtained results, interview method (questionnaire) - data acquisition required for the research, statistical method - analysis of statistical information, comparative method - description of the obtained data and drawing conclusions. The financial literacy of Daugavpils youth has been researched and evaluated. The results of the questionnaires show that more than half of respondents have given good estimates of their financial literacy; however, at the same time research results prove that the overall level of financial literacy is not sufficiently high.

TI  - Individual entrepreneurial behavior and financial literacy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - The technological revolution we have been witnessing over the last 30 years is bringing about important changes in business management, specifically in the conception, development, and management of its financial aspects. How to face these challenges is a particularly critical question for individual entrepreneurs who have to assume a much greater responsibility for decisions than in other corporate environments. In this sense, it is very important to understand the financial capabilities and skills and their limitations of this type of entrepreneurship, which is so important for the renewal and extension of the business community in any developed economy. Based on an extensive official survey of this type of entrepreneurship, this research proposes a logistic regression modeling, in order to find out the level of financial knowledge of this business group. One of the findings of this research is that individual entrepreneurs have a higher level of financial knowledge than salaried workers, with a higher qualification in this respect in the case of individual entrepreneurs with employees. This study analyses the link between individual entrepreneurs or self-employed workers - with or without employees - and financial literacy. In addition, we investigated the relationship between this group with their socio-demographic characteristics, financial product holdings, financial planning, and financial fragility. Different binary logistic regression models with maximum likelihood were estimated using a sample of individual entrepreneurs and self-employed workers from the Survey of Financial Competences database conducted in Spain to achieve this. The results of the study show that individuals who choose to be individual entrepreneurs or self-employed, and in particular those with hired workers, had a higher level of financial literacy than salaried workers. Moreover, it was confirmed that financial literacy complements the explanatory power of the other variables analyzed with respect to sole proprietors without employees, although not to a significant degree. The limitations of this work are due to the use of data from the Financial Skills Survey, so some dichotomous variables offer very generic information. In addition, the database is cross-sectional and we cannot analyze variations between different periods. No research before had applied the relationships between the behavior of individual entrepreneurs, with and without employees, and financial competencies using logistic functions and on the basis of a rigorous and comprehensive formal questionnaire. The conclusions provide a valuable perspective for developing training programs for this type of human capital aimed at raising the financial skills of individual entrepreneurs to improve personal and business management.

TI  - GENDER DIFFERENCES IN RATIONALITY AND FINANCIAL LITERACY
T2  - TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS
AB  - Financial literacy is an important indicator of the overall knowledge of individuals needed for everyday decision-making in individual finances. Acceleration of economic processes has increased importance of financial literacy over time. The aim of the presented study is to examine the financial literacy of adolescents and young adults in Slovakia in context of their rationality. Using questionnaire, we collect data on 447 individuals. Correspondence analysis reveals that men's financial literacy is more dependent on rationality for less rational men and strongly rational men. In the case of moderately rational men, we find relatively inconsistent results in relation to financial literacy. Women ' s financial literacy is less determined by their rationality.

TI  - The Effects of Financial Literacy on Sustainable Entrepreneurship
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Entrepreneurship contributes to the economic well-being of every country. Specifically, the level of individual entrepreneurship is crucial in the process of developing and building economic potential, especially in Central European countries. Among the several factors impacting entrepreneurship, the ability to access the necessary external sources of financing need to be considered crucial. The financial literacy of the entrepreneur plays a crucial role in the relationship between the lender and the borrower. In this paper, we investigate the effects of financial literacy on sustainable entrepreneurship. We based our analysis on the framework proposed by the World Economic Forum. We present an OLS model that adopts entrepreneurship, financial literacy and macroeconomic variables. The analysis is carried out on individual and national data from different sources of information (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, World Bank, and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development). The results show a positive and statistically significant relationship between financial literacy and sustainable entrepreneurial activity. This evidence supports the increasing number of financial education initiatives and the inclusion of topics related to economic and financial culture in school education systems. We identify internationally valid policy implications. In the context of the growth strategies of Central European countries, financial literacy takes on even greater importance. The introduction of financial education in the national curricula could strengthen entrepreneurial skills and accelerate the inclusive growth process across Europe.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - We examine the impact of financial literacy on the propensity for entrepreneurship among rural-urban migrants, using panel data from the 2013 and 2015 China Household Finance Survey. While migration's positive influence on entrepreneurship is well-recognised, we document novel evidence suggesting that higher levels of financial literacy among rural-urban migrants have an additional positive effect. Among the mechanisms through which financial literacy facilitates the transition of disadvantaged rural-urban migrants into entrepreneurs, social capital emerges as the most important, consistent with the findings of the literature on underdog entrepreneurship.

TI  - Financial literacy and security-based crowdfunding
T2  - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW
AB  - Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the relationship between financial literacy and the survival profile of the security-based crowdfunding platforms. Security-based crowdfunding has recently emerged as a novel market that allows small investors to engage directly in financing entrepreneurial ventures. However, a certain level of financial literacy is required to understand and manage these digital finance tools. A better understanding of the impact of financial literacy is, therefore, central to the development of these markets and the achievement of their inclusive potential.
   Research Findings/Insights: Using data of the universe of 432 security-based crowdfunding platforms in 37 OECD countries from 2007 to 2019, we find higher platforms' survival profiles where the level of financial literacy is high. Financial literacy, however, needs to combine with specific platform characteristics to take full effect, as it matters more to those platforms that deliver voting rights and that provide poorer value-added services to crowdfunding investors.
   Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support to the role of governance mechanisms at the platform level for differences in the level of financial literacy across countries. As such, it contributes to literature both on financial literacy and corporate governance. Additionally, it extends previous research in crowdfunding to the platform level.
   Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study calls for the attention of policymakers interested in the development of crowdfunding markets. The importance of financial literacy varies with the presence of governance mechanisms and information production at the platform-level.

TI  - Entrepreneurial participation and performance: the role of financial literacy
T2  - MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurial activities, and the moderating effects of industrial regulation in the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurship.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In this study, the role of financial literacy on entrepreneurial participation and performance is investigated through multi-sourced data from the Chinese Family Panel Studies with manually merged provincial and industrial data from 2014. Four hypotheses are tested based on Probit and Tobit models. Moreover, instrumental variable method and principal component analysis are applied to provide robustness checks.
   Findings
   The empirical results demonstrate that financial literacy has significantly positive effects on entrepreneurial participation, as well as on entrepreneurial performance. In addition, industrial regulation positively moderates the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurial participation and performance, which indicates that financial literacy plays a more important role in promoting entrepreneurship in tightly regulated industries.
   Originality/value
   This study proposes and tests the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurial activities, which fills an important gap in the literature. The results in this paper provide evidence that financial literacy has positive impacts in both the entry and operation stages of entrepreneurship. This evidence provides theoretical foundations for policy making in popularizing financial knowledge and supporting entrepreneurial activities. Moreover, this research further reveals the effects of industrial regulation in the context of China, suggesting that the government should be more effective in promoting administrative decentralization and reducing unnecessary interventions.

TI  - Financial Literacy to Improve Sustainability: A Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The study of financial literacy and sustainability has attracted much interest recently and is expanding quickly. This paper offers a trustworthly, consistent, and current financial literacy and sustainability analysis following bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review. Concerning 127 documents published between 2008 and October 2022, we specifically examined the co-occurrence of author keywords, co-citation analysis of cited references, and subsequent in-depth analysis. Results show that the following topics have received the most attention in analyzing financial literacy and sustainability research: (1) financial inclusion; (2) financial behaviour; (3) financial systems; and (4) decision-making. The trick-down growth and development theory, the consumption function theory, the resource-based view theory, and the theory of entrepreneurship are the theoretical pillars supporting this study's structure. Next, we create an integrative framework as the foundation for additional research. As a result, this review provides a thorough overview of financial literacy and sustainability research.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Financial Performance of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
T2  - SOUTH EAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - Research Aims - The study aims to examine the influence of financial literacy on the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data were obtained from questionnaires distributed to 200 SME managers/owners. Multiple regression analysis was applied to test the influence of financial literacy on SMEs performance by controlling manager profile and SME-specific characteristics.
   Research Findings - Multiple regression results prove that financial literacy has a positive and significant impact on SMEs' performance. Managers/owners with financial literacy skills understand business-related financial concepts, including debt, savings, takaful, insurance, and investment, which ensure the good performance of their business.
   Theoretical Contribution/Originality - Similar research has been conducted outside Malaysia. However, there is a need to validate the financial literacy and SME performance relationship in the Malaysian environment due to differences in culture; ways of thinking; and legal, business, and political situations. These differences lead to different responses which then contribute to the way the effect of financial literacy on SME performance is explained. In addition, this study improves the consistency of the existing evidence on SME performance and expands the scope of the Resource-Based View (RBV) from the perspective of SMEs
   Research limitation & implications - Government agencies such as SME Corporation recognise the importance of financial literacy among entrepreneurs. Therefore, proactive efforts need to be accelerated to provide an adequate level of financial literacy among entrepreneurs. Furthermore, entrepreneurial finance can be introduced in formal and non-formal education to ensure that every layer of society enjoys the benefits regardless of their economic status.

TI  - TOWARDS FINANCIAL LITERACY: A CASE OF SLOVAKIA
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - The level of financial literacy in the Slovak Republic has long been below the European Union average, which is confirmed by several surveys in recent years. In practice, this creates several problems. Almost a million Slovaks have at least one foreclosure, resulting from buying necessities on credit and then living in ever-increasing debt. Knowledge of finance and business among employees or budding entrepreneurs is also problematic. Conservative Slovaks also keep most of their money in products with zero interest and are afraid to invest and capitalize on their savings. The National Bank of Slovakia and the Slovak Bank Association have been calling for a change in school curricula for a long time because financially illiterate pupils eventually become poorly literate clients. The contribution's primary purpose was to analyze the state of financial education in secondary schools in the Slovak Republic, including a more effective design of the content and method of teaching financial literacy. More effective financial education could help reduce poverty in Slovakia and more effective financial and business literacy in society.

AB  - This research aims to scan financial literacy in Mozambique, assessing its levels and identifying the sociodemographic factors that influence it, generalizing to the developing countries. Quantitative research was performed using a survey database of 3,875 respondents collected in Mozambique. Our results document that more than 61% of the respondents did not answer correctly the questions regarding financial literacy, which indicates that the levels of financial literacy in Mozambique are low. Individuals are not qualified to make the most appropriate financial decisions and end up compromising their financial well-being. It was also found that age impacts respondents' financial knowledge, gender influences financial behavior, educational level influences financial knowledge and behavior, and the training area influences financial knowledge, attitude, and behavior. This article contributes by providing information regarding the financial literacy of Mozambique, which is still scarce and providing a sci-entific basis for decision-makers to improve public policies regarding financial literacy.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Determinants of financial literacy: Empirical evidence from micro and small enterprises in India
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of general financial literacy, specific financial literacy and overall financial literacy among the Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) entrepreneurs. The data has been collected from 309 respondents from three districts in the Punjab state of India. Using ordered logit model, the results depict that the age of the entrepreneur has positive and significant effect on different types of financial literacy for the MSEs in Punjab. The findings also show that the micro and small-service enterprises have significantly higher level of financial literacy than its other manufacturing counterparts. The study also found that entrepreneurs with higher level of education have significantly higher level of all types of financial literacy. The most influencing determinant that affects the financial literacy of the entrepreneurs is found to be the level of gross profit ratio of the enterprise. Higher the gross profit ratio of the firm, significantly higher will be the level of all three types of financial literacy of the entrepreneurs. For policy perspectives, the present study recommends that firms should keep some portion of their profits to educate their employees that enhance the financial literacy. Government should help the MSEs to educate the firms to improve their level of financial literacy. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Financial literacy, farmland mortgage financing, and household entrepreneurship: Empirical evidence from rural China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN ECONOMICS
AB  - Farmland mortgage financing policy has been actively carried out and intertwined with mass entrepreneurship strategy in China in recent years. Using survey data of 1947 rural households in pilot counties of farmland mortgage loans (FMLs), we contribute to the literature by examining the impact of financial literacy on rural households' entrepreneurship with considering the heterogeneity between agricultural and non-agricultural entrepreneurship and exploring how financial literacy affects entrepreneurship through FMLs. The results show that financial literacy has a significant and positive impact on both rural households' agricultural and non-agricultural entrepreneurship. Moreover, households with higher level of financial literacy show a higher probability in the application for and approval of more FMLs. This study provides strong evidence that the impact of financial literacy on farm households' agricultural entrepreneurship is partially mediated by FMLs, while that impact on their non-agricultural entrepreneurship is partially suppressed by FMLs. We further find that financial literacy can also increase rural households' entrepreneurial income through their approval of FMLs. These findings suggest that systematical financial literacy training programs are needed to popularize FML products and services and facilitate rural households' entrepreneurship.

TI  - Financial inclusion - does digital financial literacy matter for women entrepreneurs?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose - Women's financial inclusion has become a global research agenda, and past studies provide mixed evidence on the determinants of financial inclusion among women entrepreneurs across the globe. However, the impact of digital financial literacy on women's financial inclusion has seldom been addressed in the past literature.Design/methodology/approach - The authors perform a cross-sectional analysis of 144 countries using the World Bank Global Findex Database.Findings - This study's probabilistic regression results indicate that women entrepreneurs with a higher degree of digital financial literacy are more likely to engage in formal banking channels.Practical implications - The study findings have practical implications in terms of allowing regulators and banks to draw effective policies to attract women customers. Lack of effective regulatory intervention could lead to women exploring financial crimes, such as money laundering, due to their lack of involvement with the formal banking channel.Originality/value - The authors explore the impact of digital financial literacy on women's financial inclusion. Such evidence is rare in the existing literature.

TI  - Financial literacy, financial development, and leverage of small firms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - This study examines the relationship between financial literacy and the leverage of small firms, specifically of the legal forms, sole proprietorships, and partnerships. Using a cross-section of 73,302 firms in 22 countries, we find that the leverage of small firms is negatively associated with financial literacy. Further, we explore the role of financial development, bankruptcy and transaction costs, and information asymmetry, in moderating the rela-tionship. We find that the negative relationship is less pronounced in countries with lower financial development, high bankruptcy and transaction costs, and high information asymmetry environments, respectively. We contribute to the understanding of small firms' leverage and the literature on financial literacy, SMEs, finance, and entrepreneurship. This study offers policy implications for economies that promote SMEs for entrepre-neurship training and development.

TI  - Financial literacy and the household participation in commercial insurance: Evidence from China
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Utilizing China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data in 2017, this study examines the influence of financial literacy on household commercial insurance engagement. Empirical findings reveal that higher financial literacy correlates with increased likelihood and expenditure on commercial insurance. Education level and trust in commercial insurance also significantly enhance market participation. The study also discovers that financial literacy interacts with entrepreneurship, positively affecting family insurance purchasing behaviors. Particularly, financial literacy more significantly promotes insurance purchases in less educated families and communities with lower purchasing rates. In conclusion, our research not only contributes to enriching the study on the real effects of financial literacy, but also provides policy guidelines for governments on enhancing household participation in commercial insurance markets.

TI  - Digital transformation, financial literacy and rural household entrepreneurship
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - This paper empirically investigates the impact of digital transformation on the performance of rural household entrepreneurship. We find that digital transformation promotes rural household entrepreneurship performance. Financial literacy plays a role as a moderating variable between the two. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the facilitating effect of digital transformation on rural household entrepreneurship performance is more significant in the central and western regions. This paper enriches the research on digital transformation from a micro perspective, complements the relevant research on rural households, and explores the mechanism of digital transformation ' s impact on rural household entrepreneurship performance.

TI  - Effect of Financial Literacy on Poverty Reduction Across Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda
T2  - GLOBAL SOCIAL WELFARE
AB  - Financial literacy can be critical to reducing poverty, but limited evidence exists on the mechanisms of change. Guided by the financial capability framework, this study examines the direct effects of financial literacy on poverty and the indirect effect through financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, using data from wave 5 of the InterMedia Financial Inclusion Insights Program for Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. We also examined how the relationships differ by gender and locality. Overall, the endogeneity-corrected results suggest that an increase in financial literacy is associated with a 6.9% decrease in poverty. We found that entrepreneurship and financial inclusion act as mechanisms of change through which financial literacy decreases poverty, with the findings differing by gender and locality. These findings point to the poverty-reducing effect of financial literacy, mainly in Tanzania, followed by Kenya and Uganda. The results contribute to understanding how financial literacy and poverty interact and can inform contextually relevant interventions and policies.

TI  - Financial Literacy of legislators in Africa: An Exploratory Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
AB  - Financial literacy is a catalyst to improve financial decisions and financial inclusion in the society. Existing studies demonstrate a growing research outputs on financial literacy in all facets of the society except the legislature, one of three principal branches of government. Despite the fact that the legislature is the law-making body of financial bills and regulations in the society, little is known a bout the level of financial literacy of the members of the legislature. This study aims to explore the financial literacy of the legislators in Africa. A survey aided in obtaining primary data from 87 legislators of the Pan-African Parliament in Africa. Data obtained were analysed using descriptive and the probit statistical techniques. The results reveal education, profession and income as the main factors influencing financial literacy of legislators. In addition, the results revealed an average level of knowledge on cash budget, savings and investment, retirement planning and bank accounts of legislators. The study recommends that legislators must enroll in current and relevant financial programs, and use more financial apps for their financial activities. As a first of its kind, the study makes significant contributions to further studies and public policy.

TI  - Constituting financialized subjectivities: cultural political economy of financial literacy in Turkey
T2  - TURKISH STUDIES
AB  - Financial literacy is defined as the knowledge, skills, and ability to navigate increasingly complex financial markets, and is considered to empower consumers to make responsible financial decisions. It has been widely promoted as a crucial life skill following the 2008 financial crisis. This study critically analyzes financial literacy education initiatives in Turkey through ethnographic research. Financial literacy curricula provide the basic knowledge of finance as well as instruct subjects ways to conduct financial planning, budgeting, debt management, creditworthiness, saving, and investment. Financial literacy agenda deepens neo-liberal governmentality by promoting an entrepreneurial subjectivity and making individuals more aware and responsible for social risks. The cultural political economy perspective of this study analyzes financialized capital accumulation dynamics together with the reshaping of culture and the constitution of financialized subjectivities.

TI  - Entrepreneurial spirits in women and men. The role of financial literacy and digital skills
T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the attitudes to entrepreneurship of Italian households, focusing on the importance of financial literacy and digital skills as potentially relevant factors shaping entrepreneurship. We put the gender focus to our analysis to detect whether, and to what extent, women and men differ in their propensity to run a business. We carry out our research by using the Bank of Italy SHIW dataset for the years 2008 and 2010. Our findings suggest a strong heterogeneity between men and women in the role played by financial literacy and digital skills. Results show a positive and significant correlation between financial literacy and the probability of being an entrepreneur but only for men. We also find that digitally skilled male respondents are much more likely to be entrepreneurs.

TI  - FOLLOW US, NOT? GENDER DIFFERENCES IN FINANCIAL LITERACY IN GLOBAL LEADER OF GENDER EQUALITY*
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - Gender differences in financial literacy are examined in this research. A considerable body of research suggests women are inferior to men when it comes to financial literacy. Various social factors (e.g., gender inequality) are typically attributed as antecedents of this reality. We set out to investigate whether gender differences in financial literacy are present in Iceland, the most gender-equal country in the world. If financial literacy is based on social norms and issues, gender differences in financial literacy should be less in countries like Iceland, where women are highly economically and otherwise empowered. Using a representative sample from the Icelandic population and controlling for a host of factors, we find women to be less financially literate than men despite substantial gender equality in Iceland.

TI  - Financial literacy and support for free trade in the UK
T2  - WORLD ECONOMY
AB  - Recent events in Europe and the United States suggest that open economies are increasingly under stress as nationalist, protectionist and populist political entrepreneurs are gaining significant ground across the Western world. Many theories have been formulated as to which factors are more likely to explain such policy preferences. The hypothesis tested in this paper is that financial literacy affects economic policy preferences. I analyse data from the British Election Study and test my theory on support for free trade in the United Kingdom. Findings suggest that financial literacy does affect economic policy preferences. On average, financially literate individuals are more likely to think that free trade is good for the British economy. Furthermore, this is true regardless of economic self-interest, as both financially literate winners and losers from globalisation are more likely to support free trade than their illiterate counterparts.

TI  - The impact of entrepreneurs's financial literacy on innovation within small and medium-sized enterprises
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS JOURNAL-RESEARCHING ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - This article analyses the impact of an entrepreneur's financial literacy upon innovation within small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and, in so doing, extends human capital theory to consider the effect of financial literacy on risky investment decisions. Using a large survey dataset of Chinese SMEs in 2015 and 2017, our findings suggest that financial literacy is positively associated with innovation; positive relationships are robust to different innovation metrics. In addition, we find that gender matters, as male owners appear to promote more innovations, while firm size is positively associated with innovation. Additional analysis suggests that risk tolerance is a transmission mechanism for the impact of financial literacy on innovation. Our results corroborate previous studies showing that individuals with greater financial literacy make sound personal financial decisions and so have important public policy implications.

TI  - Improving financial literacy of the poor and vulnerable in Indonesia: An empirical analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION
AB  - We describe and report the results of an 18-month long training of trainers program in financial literacy and soft skills designed to improve employability of poor and vulnerable Indonesian youth. The program was part of an Inclusive Workforce Development project sponsored by USAID/Indonesia. Twenty-five teachers received training in December 2017 and subsequently conducted 30 trainings for 601 students in West Java from January through May 2018. The training consisted of 18 sessions covering basics of financial literacy and employment-related soft skills. Both participating trainers and students showed statistically significant increases in financial literacy knowledge, and student perceptions about their acquisition of soft skills improved as well. Increases in student financial literacy knowledge were found to relate to prior knowledge, job experience, the type of school they attend, the perceived acquisition of soft skills, and the intention to incorporate the training into their daily lives. Given that the economic education literature links financial literacy to improved worker productivity, decreased absenteeism, and entrepreneurial success, these findings are encouraging for both the students involved and for their employers in Indonesia.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY OF SECONDARY SCHOOL LEAVERS: A CASE OF LATGALE REGION IN LATVIA
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - Financial literacy, as a totality of knowledge and skills, provides an opportunity for a person to manage finances successfully, and take rational decisions concerning the choice of various financial services, thus facilitating both individual and public welfare and sustainability. The financial markets have changed along with the financial consumers' awareness. Financial services have become a mass and freely accessible product group, whereas financial institutions have become a part of everyday life for all social groups. Over time, the age of the persons involved in financial processes and evolving consumers of financial services becomes younger and younger. Hence, the need for knowledge and awareness of finances, financial product diversity and related risks is growing more acute for improving financial decision-making. For this reason, financial literacy is acknowledged as a vital life skill globally. The research aims to study, assess, and analyse the financial literacy of secondary school leavers in Latgale.

TI  - Financial literacy and self employment-The moderating effect of gender and race
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Within the next decade, the number of self-employed workers, now 40% of the workforce, is predicted to surpass that of traditional employees. Managing finances (financial literacy) is an important skill set for self-employment. We bring attention to the growing prevalence of self-employment at a time when financial literacy is in decline in the United States. Using a sample of 15,069 participants in the 2015 and 2018 National Financial Capability Study, we find support for a positive association between financial literacy and self-employment in a U.S. context and extend prior research by focusing on two widely studied and important U.S. demographic segments in selfemployment and entrepreneurship literature - gender and race. Contrary to other U.S.-based studies, we find that women with higher financial literacy scores are more likely to be self-employed than men; yet surprisingly, there is no significant difference in the association between higher financial literacy scores and self-employment between non-white and white U.S. respondents. We discuss the implications of the findings for researchers, policymakers, educators, and those considering self-employment.

TI  - Financial literacy and advice perceptions among UK higher education students: an ethnicity tale?
T2  - REVIEW OF ECONOMICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD
AB  - Although considerable efforts have been made in many countries to raise the financial literacy of those from disadvantaged backgrounds, it is unclear whether these are having an effect. This is particularly the case for those of ethnic minority background, who may suffer from other disadvantages. This study examines the financial literacy of students from two universities in the East Midlands region of the UK. It considers the role played by ethnic background. It is found that significant differences in financial literacy remain between the White majority and particular ethnic groups. In part, this appears to reflect their perceptions of the types of decision they see financial literacy relating to. Some ethnic groups saw financial literacy as being of more relevance for larger, less frequent financial decisions, but saw less connection, and relevance, to the day to day choices they had to make. Ethnicity also potentially has an indirect effect, as informal sources of advice, and those that promote a financial market perspective, tend to be valued more highly. The implications are worrying given that the respondents are the more highly educated independent young members of the population. Current attempts to assist the development of financial literacy therefore appear to be failing those from some ethnic minority groups. This will leave them at a continuing disadvantage, unless interventions can highlight the day to day importance and value of financial literacy.

TI  - Does female descendent entrepreneur's self-compassion and financial literacy matter for succession success?
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposePresent study investigated the influence of female descendent entrepreneur's self-compassion on the perceived succession success of small-family businesses (S-FB) with the mediating mechanism of financial literacy.Design/methodology/approachThe primary data was collected from 319 female descendent entrepreneurs who were designated as chairwomen, and managing director positions in their retails sector S-FBs. The purposive sampling technique was used to collect the data. The provided hypotheses are tested using the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. This study followed multiple regression analyses to see the influence of self-compassion (mindfulness, self-isolation, self-judgment and over-identification) on financial literacy and perceived succession success.FindingsThe results reveal that female descendent entrepreneurs mindfulness and over-identification significantly increase but self-isolation decreases the likelihood of successful succession transition. Moreover, female descendent entrepreneur's financial literacy increases mindfulness and overidentification while it decreases self-isolation and improves the likelihood of succession success. However, financial literacy does not influence self-judgmental traits and perceived succession success.Practical implicationsThis study highlights a vital issue, how the financial literacy of female descendent entrepreneurs manages their self-compassion and increases the likelihood of succession success. In addition, it covers a research gap and helps the S-FBs to improve their survival rate by focusing on the descendent entrepreneur's self-compassion and financial literacy.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the body of knowledge by emphasizing predictors that influence the successful succession transition to subsequent generations. This study determines the influence of self-compassion of female descendent entrepreneurs on perceived succession success and financial literacy as a mediator by using the self-control theory. The study can be useful to family business consultants, policymakers and family businesses.

TI  - Social Capital, Financial Literacy, and Rural Household Entrepreneurship: A Mediating Effect Analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - In rural areas, entrepreneurship helps lift households out of poverty by alleviating unemployment and increasing income, and financial literacy plays an important role in promoting entrepreneurship. Social capital is a resource embedded in social relationships, the boundaries of which have been expanded by the development of information communications technologies (ICTs). This article aims to link social capital, financial literacy, and rural entrepreneurship through a partial mediating effect analysis. Using data from the 2015 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), we analyze how social capital affects rural entrepreneurship and the role of local ICTs development in this effect while also accounting for reverse causality. We construct a social capital indicator, mainly referring to bridging social capital, and two financial literacy indicators to make the conclusions robust. The empirical results show that social capital promotes rural entrepreneurship by sharing financial literacy. Furthermore, the spread of ICTs enhances this mediating effect. Our study provides empirical evidence for encouraging entrepreneurship and promoting knowledge sharing and implies the importance of ICTs in promoting entrepreneurship in rural areas.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Risk Aversion, Financial Performance, and Innovative Behavior in Indonesian SMEs
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - Lampung is one of the provinces that makes a major contribution to the Indonesian economy. The aim was to investigate the relationship between financial literacy and risk aversion on financial performance with innovative behavior as the mediating variable. The population were the SMEs in Lampung and a sample of 284 were selected. Structural equation modeling was used to test the research hypothesis. The research findings show that financial literacy had a positive direct effect on financial performance (beta= .27, rho = .006), risk aversion had a positive direct effect on financial performance (beta= .21, rho = .000), risk aversion, which had a positive direct effect on innovative behavior (beta= .16, rho = .005). Financial literacy was found to had a positive direct effect on innovative behavior (beta= .73, rho = .000); and innovative behavior had a positive direct effect on financial performance (beta= .39, rho = .000). When innovative behavior entered the relationship between financial literacy and financial performance, the direct effect (beta= .04, rho = .000) was significant. When innovative behavior was introduced into the link between risk aversion and financial success, the direct effect was significant (beta= .34, rho = .01). As a result, innovative behavior is regarded as a moderator of financial literacy and risk aversion on financial performance. This study elaborates on the ways that SME owners can improve their financial success by enhancing their financial literacy and embracing innovative behaviors that will ultimately benefit their business.

AB  - The evaluation of financial literacy was undertaken across poor and marginalized women engaged in entrepreneurial activities across major markets of Purulia town, West Bengal. The poor performance of women entrepreneurs on the Financial Literacy Score (FLS) was noticed. A significant gap was observed between the information about the financial system and access to their instruments. The study suggested developing financial literacy through induction programs and awareness camps among local entrepreneurs. The bank correspondence model can serve more efficiently by extending cooperation and trustworthiness.

TI  - Is Awareness That Powerful? Women's Financial Literacy Support to Prospects Behaviour in Prudent Decision-making
T2  - GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Financial literacy is of utmost relevance in the field of entrepreneurship, especially in developing countries. However, what builds financial literacy and how it shapes investment decision-making of women entrepreneurs is an exiguously researched area. Building on this gap, this study postulates that women entrepreneurs' prospect behavioural factors (loss aversion, regret aversion, mental accounting, and self-control) impact their investment decision process through the intervening role of financial literacy. Based on a stratified sample of 579 women entrepreneurs operating in Punjab, Pakistan, structural equation modelling was used to analyse the hypothesized relationship among variables. Findings showed that loss aversion, regret aversion, mental accounting, and self-control significantly influenced women's financial literacy and investment decision process, whereas no impact of regret aversion was traced on investment decision-making. Thus, our results offered robust support that financial literacy stimulated by women entrepreneurs' prospect behaviour invigorates their investment decision power.

TI  - Financial literacy, role models, and micro-enterprise performance in the informal economy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS JOURNAL-RESEARCHING ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - This article analyses how financial literacy and role models contribute to explaining the performance of micro-enterprises in the informal economy. Grounded in human capital reasoning and social learning theory, we argue that financial literacy and personal knowledge of role models lead to improved firm performance. We test our hypotheses on a unique dataset of 739 micro-enterprises in Ecuador. We find that financial literacy is an important predictor of financial performance but not growth, and the use of role models predicts return on assets but not other performance metrics. Our results have implications for future work on micro-enterprises and the nature of the human and social capital of their founders.

TI  - The role of financial literacy in households' asset accumulation process: evidence from Ghana
T2  - REVIEW OF ECONOMICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD
AB  - This paper examines the impact of financial literacy training on household asset accumulation using data collected from a randomised controlled trial implemented in Ghana. Financial assets are measured using account holdings and savings while durable assets and their decomposed components are captured using their total values. After testing for baseline balance, impact is estimated using treatment effect models. We find that financial literacy training plays a significant role in accumulation of both financial and durable assets, but the impact is more evident in the accumulation of productive durable assets. Our overall findings on productive and non-productive assets are robust to alternative conceptualisations of what constitutes productive and non-productive assets. Our results also show that financial literacy training has an impact on the accumulation of both total and productive assets in female-beneficiary households, as well as enhancing account holdings for females, although this effect was larger for males. The analyses for different age cohorts also revealed that financial literacy training results in higher asset accumulation among younger household heads.

TI  - A Study on the Impact of Financial Literacy and Digital Capabilities on Entrepreneurial Intention: Mediating Effect of Entrepreneurship
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
AB  - In the post-COVID-19 era, the content of work and the necessary skills are rapidly changing due to the digital transformation of the way people work. Entrepreneurial adaptability and digital capability are the most necessary competencies for exploring opportunities and quickly turning them into a professional career amid a crisis. Financial literacy is also essential for expanding skills in economic and social life. The purpose of this study is to verify the influence of university students' financial literacy and digital capability on entrepreneurial intention and the mediating effect of entrepreneurship. To this end, a survey was conducted on university students in Busan and Gyeongnam, and a sample of 162 respondents was verified using SPSS 28.0. As a result of the study, it was found that financial literacy had a partially positive effect on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention. Digital capability was found to have a positive effect on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention. It was found that entrepreneurship had a partially positive effect on entrepreneurial intention. It was found that entrepreneurship had a partially positive mediating effect between financial literacy and entrepreneurial intention. It was found that entrepreneurship had a positive mediating effect between digital capability and entrepreneurial intention. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that financial literacy, digital capability, and entrepreneurship are very important competencies for university students to adapt to new trends and promote start-ups in a rapidly changing job environment after COVID-19, suggesting the need for further education.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL SELF-EFFICACY ON PERSISTENCE: DO FINANCIAL LITERACY AND ENTREPRENEURIAL PASSION MATTER?
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - The primary purpose of the current study is to investigate the entrepreneurial self-efficacy as an antecedent to persistency among entrepreneurs. In addition to that, the study examines the mediating role of entrepreneurial passion between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and entrepreneurial persistence. Lastly, the study explored the relationship between financial literacy and persistence and its moderating role between entrepreneurial passion and persistence. Structural equation modeling through of partial least square bootstrapping resampling was used for hypotheses testing to analyze the data collected from a sample of 273 Malaysian entrepreneurs. The results of the study supported all arguments broached in the current research for the subjective norm, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, which showed a significant impact on entrepreneurial passion and entrepreneurial persistence. The moderating effect of financial literacy on entrepreneurial passion and entrepreneurial persistency was also highly significant. The current work is among the pioneering studies that examine entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial passion, financial literacy and entrepreneurial persistence among entrepreneurs.

TI  - Investigating The Mediating Role of Financial Literacy on The Relationship Between Women Entrepreneurs' Behavioral Biases and Investment Decision Making
T2  - GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS
AB  - This study investigates the theoretical link between heuristic behavioral factors and the investment decision-making of women entrepreneurs, focusing on the importance of financial literacy as a potential mediator shaping prudent decision-making. We argue that women's financial literacy is an efficient way to apply behavioral considerations in wise decision making. Using the proportionate stratified sampling method, we collected data from women entrepreneurs who were formally registered in Punjab Province, Pakistan. Owing to the complex model and small sample size, the smart PLS method was applied to analyze the structural relationship between the measured and latent constructs. The results show that overconfidence and availability heuristics have a significant positive impact on investment decisions, while financial literacy plays an essential intervening role between the overconfidence heuristic, availability heuristic, and investment decision-making. Our results support the execution of financial literacy awareness among women entrepreneurs to stimulate their financial decision control and give them the independence to make prudent financial decisions.

TI  - How Does Financial Literacy Promote Sustainability in SMEs? A Developing Country Perspective
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Role of the knowledge-based resources in promoting sustainability in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is currently a topic of debate. Financial literacy has been identified as a vital knowledge resource for financial decision making, but insufficient attention has been given to how SMEs' financial literacy affects their sustainability. Drawing upon a knowledge-based perspective, peaking order theory and dual process theory, we constructed an integrated model to examine the impact of financial literacy, access to finance and financial risk attitude on SMEs' sustainability. The sample included 291 chief financial officers (CFOs) of SMEs in Sri Lanka. The output of structural equation modelling revealed direct positive effects of financial literacy, access to finance and financial risk attitude on sustainability. Financial literacy also emerged as a predictor of access to finance and financial risk attitude. Moreover, access to finance and financial risk attitude were found to be partial mediators of the relationship between financial literacy and SMEs' sustainability. Theoretical implications and practical implications for policymakers, industry practitioners and academics interested in promoting sustainability amongst SMEs are discussed.

TI  - The role of financial literacy in retirement investment choice
T2  - EQUILIBRIUM-QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND ECONOMIC POLICY
AB  - Research background: Preparation for retirement is a major concern for the people in the workforce as they have to encounter considerable difficulties in making the right investment decisions for their retirement.
   Purpose of the article: This research extends the literature on personal finance by investigating the impact of both financial literacy levels and pension knowledge on employees' investment choice decision for their retirement, while in previous literature the role of these factors has mainly been explored separately.
   Methods: To conduct the research, a survey questionnaire was applied to collect data in three main regions of Vietnam comprising Northern. Central and Southern Vietnam. Data collection was made in 2018, in which 427 valid questionnaires Were used for data analysis from 700 questionnaires. Two estimation methods are employed for analysis in this study, including a linear probability model (LPM) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) model. The findings of this research remain significant after the Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression model is used as an estimation technique to eliminate potential bias caused by endogenous problems.
   Finding & Value added: 'the results show that basic financial literacy level and pension knowledge are principal factors which significantly increase the probability of exercising retirement investment choice of employees, while advanced financial literacy level factor has a significant effect on choosing growth investing options for their retirement. Further. this research finds that there is no correlation between employees' financial risk tolerance and their retirement investment choice. Furthermore, the study proposes and offers new evidence that pension knowledge is a decisive factor providing employees with encouragement to exercise retirement investment choice and those who consult with financial advisors tend to take part in growth investing option.

TI  - Does Financial Mindfulness Make a Difference? A Nexus of Financial Literacy and Behavioural Biases in Women Entrepreneurs
T2  - IIM KOZHIKODE SOCIETY & MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - This article aims to determine the intervening strength of financial mindfulness between financial literacy and behavioural biases in women entrepreneurs. The literature has an enduring discussion regarding the profoundly unique financial behaviour of women. Financial literacy and behavioural biases constitute a recurrent research topic, yet how this nexus exists in the premise of women's entrepreneurship is not well known. Building on this gap, we examined the impact of financial literacy on women entrepreneurs' behavioural biases by focusing on financial mindfulness as a potential moderator. A random sample of 346 women entrepreneurs operating in Pakistan was analysed using structural equation modelling through AMOS 21. The results revealed a significant direct impact of financial literacy on reducing anchoring and herding bias; however, financial literacy was found to be unrelated to mental accounting bias. The moderation analysis further revealed interesting indirect impacts, such that financial literacy strongly reduced mental accounting and herding bias for financially mindful women. Nonetheless, financial mindfulness does not negatively catalyse the relationship between financial literacy and anchoring bias. By encompassing the concepts of financial literacy, mindfulness and behavioural biases, we offer a unique theoretical strand with practical implications for women entrepreneurs. We suggest new avenues for the longstanding dilemma related to the factors instigating suboptimal financial decision-making in women entrepreneurs in developing markets.

TI  - Influence of Financial Literacy and Educational Skills on Entrepreneurial Intent: Empirical Evidence from Young Entrepreneurs of Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This paper attempts to study the impact of Financial Literacy on Youth Entrepreneurial Intent in Pakistan. A closed-ended self-administered structured questionnaire covering financial literacy, computer knowledge, financial attitude, and financial knowledge with Entrepreneurial Intent was collected from young entrepreneurs. The research tried to investigate the education level with computer skill to inspect the effect of financial literateness on young generation Entrepreneurial Intent in the context of Pakistan. The research model was tested using PLS-SEM and authenticating a measurement model through the advanced methodology and their association with Entrepreneurial Intent. Results revealed that financial literacy and its two parts (financial attitude and financial knowledge) have a positive impact on Entrepreneurial Intent. The size of the joint impact of financial literacy and its components on Entrepreneurial Intent was assessed to be adequate. Entrepreneurial Intent is essential for creating new firms to maintain economic development. Furthermore, it is determined in this research that if youth has better financial knowledge and financial attitude, the probability of Entrepreneurial Intent increases. This suggests that if the youth in Pakistan desire to attain a higher limit of Entrepreneurial Intent, they must implement financial literacy models for enhancing and promoting their current Entrepreneurial Intent.

AB  - This article examines the relationship between financial literacy and business interruption (BI) insurance among Italian entrepreneurs. Following an increase in unexpected shocks, such as COVID-19 and geopolitical conflicts, a high level of BI risk is expected to persist, especially among small firms, which play a key role in the Italian economy. Using a Bank of Italy 2021 survey of 1998 non-financial firms with fewer than 10 employees, we show a significant positive association between the level of the entrepreneur's financial literacy and the purchase of BI insurance. Our results highlight the key role of financial literacy in shaping risk management strategies and are robust to different model specifications, also addressing endogeneity concerns.

T2  - BILIMNAME
AB  - Financial Inclusion is one of the important parts of the financial system and Islamic Financial Literacy is a concept that requires knowledge about the Islamic financial system and can contribute positively to financial inclusion. This research has several goals. First, it aims to determine students' Islamic financial literacy levels in various faculties in a Turkish university. Secondly, it is aims to investigate the relationship between Islamic financial literacy level and financial attitude and behavior. Third, the impact of Islamic financial literacy on the entrepreneurial tendency is predicted. Finally, determining whether the level of Islamic financial literacy differs according to various demographic factors, especially the faculty variable, whether it is taking finance, or Islamic finance courses, is among the sub-objectives of the study. The universe of the research consists of students studying in the third and fourth grades of the faculties of business, engineering, and theology at Duzce University. 513 questionnaire data obtained within the scope of the research and data were analyzed with SPSS 25 statistical program. As a result of the research, Islamic Financial Knowledge levels and Islamic Financial literacy were gauged. It was determined that the Islamic Financial Knowledge levels and Literacy were quiet low among students and, students taking Islamic finance courses had high Islamic finance literacy. Also, looking attractiveness did not put a difference on Islamic financial knowledge, it provided a statistically significant relationship between those looking attractive to entrepreneurship and those not looking attractive to entrepreneur with respect to Islamic financial literacy level.

TI  - Financial Literacy. Who, whom and what are they Training for? Comparative Analysis 2016-2020
T2  - PUBLIC FINANCE QUARTERLY-HUNGARY
AB  - The research assessed whether progress has been made in the education and development of financial awareness in Hungary since 2016. We reviewed the changes in the state's role in the development of financial literacy, and in a questionnaire survey we examined what kind of organizations, who and in what topics are involved in trainings outside the public education. It was found that between 2016 and 2020, there was an increasing focus on developing the financial literacy, while the vast majority of the trainings continues to target the most easily reachable school age group. The National Core Curriculum identified economic and financial education as a goal for schools. However, outside of vocational high schools, such knowledge is not taught as a compulsory subject. In 2017, the Government adopted a strategy to improve the financial awareness of the population, and the first accredited financial literacy textbooks were published. The results of non-public education organisations show that the number of training programs and their participants has tripled. The average duration of trainings has become longer, multi-day trainings mainly for adults appeared. Knowledge transfer continued to focus on individual frugality and financial awareness, financial self-knowledge, attitude, and behaviour. The education of investment and entrepreneurship knowledge still isn't a priority. Most of the trainings do not take into account the income situation and social background of the target groups and do not pay attention to the development of financially vulnerable groups.

TI  - Entrepreneurial Competency, Financial Literacy, and Sustainable Performance-Examining the Mediating Role of Entrepreneurial Resilience among Saudi Entrepreneurs
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This paper investigated the influence of entrepreneurial competency and financial literacy on sustainable small enterprise performance. We simultaneously investigated the mediating role of entrepreneurial resilience on the association between competence and financial literacy with sustainable business performance. We used a quantitative method for collecting data from 220 small business entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia using an online questionnaire. The collected data were analysed with the help of PLS-SEM. The results reveal that financial literacy significantly positively affects entrepreneurial competency and resilience. Entrepreneurial competency has a significant positive effect on Saudi SMEs' entrepreneurial resilience and sustainable performance. Finally, entrepreneurial resilience was simultaneously found to have a considerable impact on sustainable performance while mediating the effect of financial literacy and competency on sustainable performance across Saudi SMEs. In line with Saudi Vision 2030, with its profound focus on entrepreneurship and developing a financially independent entrepreneurial community, this research contributes to creating economic opportunities for local entrepreneurs managing small enterprises. Apart from extending the body of knowledge, this research can support policymakers in formulating relevant strategies to encourage SMEs that have been worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic to perform sustainably. Several other implications for financial institutions and entrepreneurs have also been drawn.

The authors run ordinary least squares regressions and use both the base and the partition approaches to test the hypotheses. Findings The analysis reveals a positive association between the CEO's financial literacy and firm growth. However, this relationship is not uniform across generations. The CEO's financial literacy-firm growth relationship becomes weaker for first- and third or subsequent-generation family firms while becoming stronger for second-generation family firms. Originality/value This study adds the financial literacy of the CEO as a novel individual-level determinant of family firm growth. It also shows that CEOs do not always use their financial literacy to its full potential to foster growth. More specifically, the extent to which financial literacy leads to firm growth is found to be conditional on the generational stage of the family SME. The obtained findings are valuable for family SMEs intending to hire a new CEO, encouraging the financial literacy of the current CEO and educating the next generation of family members.

TI  - Household financial literacy and relative poverty: An analysis of the psychology of poverty and market participation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Financial literacy is the significant human capital factor affecting people's ability to obtain financial services. Evaluating the relationship between financial literacy and relative poverty is of great significance to poverty reduction. This study investigated the impacts of financial literacy on relative poverty from the perspective of poverty psychology and market participation using data from the 2017, 2019 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). The empirical findings showed that financial literacy can alleviate relative household poverty through household participation in entrepreneurial activities, commercial insurance participation and the choice of lending channels. Financial literacy has significant poverty reduction effect on households of continuous operation, reduces the likelihood of exiting operation. Further discussion showed that the poverty reduction effect of financial literacy is more pronounced among households with higher levels of financial literacy, under the age of sixty, low levels of indebtedness and in the eastern region. Our study provides empirical evidence for encouraging market participation and promoting financial literacy and provide valuable recommendations for the policymaker to improve poverty reduction effect in the developing country context.

TI  - Financial literacy, access to digital finance and performance of SMEs: Evidence From Central region of Ghana
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This paper expands on financial literacy, access to digital finance, and SME performance in the Central Region of Ghana. First, the study analysed SMEs' digital platform knowledge and utilisation. It examined the relationship between financial literacy, access to digital finance, and SME performance. The paper discussed the mediating influence of access to digital finance on SMEs' financial literacy and performance. The study employed the quantitative research approach. Using the purposive sampling technique, a total of 400 responses were gathered from SMEs in Cape Coast, Mankessim, Assin Fosu, Agona Swedru, and Kasoa. The study used self-administered questionnaires to collect data. SPSS was employed to evaluate descriptive statistics. Results show that SMEs in the study areas use Mobile Money more than any other digital platform. PLS-SEM was used to investigate the relationship between financial literacy, digital finance, and SME performance. It was found that financial literacy positively affects access to digital finance. Also, access to digital finance improved performance. Access to digital finance mediates the relationship between financial literacy and SME performance. Access to digital finance is as crucial as financial literacy for increasing performance. Therefore, using digital platforms to trade would boost business performance. Digital trading platform providers should improve advertising and make their systems user-friendly.

TI  - Business experience or Financial Literacy? Which one is better for opportunity recognition and superior performance?
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Recognition of useful opportunities is very crucial for small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs') survival and growth in the competitive environment. However, the majority of SMEs cannot easily recognize new opportunities in the turbulent markets due to a lack of managerial competencies and knowledge. Several studies have been carried out to unleash the determinants of opportunity recognition that configure SMEs' success, but the results are disjointed. In particular, the mediating role of opportunity recognition between business experience, financial literacy, and SME performance has been missed. This study aims to test if either financially literate or experienced managers can recognize new opportunities that result in high performance. For testing the hypotheses, we surveyed 232 Pakistani SMEs from the manufacturing, trading, and service sectors. After performing the structural equation modeling, we found that financial literacy and business experience are the substantial prognosticators of opportunity recognition and SMEs' performance. Opportunity recognition shows a partial mediating role between financial literacy and SMEs performance as well as between business experience and SMEs performance. However, this research endorses that business experience is more vital for high performance as compared to financial literacy whereas in terms of opportunity recognition financial literacy is more crucial as compared to experience. This study recommends the enterprises to hire the financially literate and experienced managers as both display a prominent role in the identification of opportunities and high performance. Further implications are discussed.

TI  - The impact of financial literacy and financial behavior in entrepreneurial motivation - evidence from Indonesia
T2  - COGENT EDUCATION
AB  - Entrepreneurship has been viewed as a catalyst for economic growth because it creates jobs and offers solutions to social issues. The government is trying to make entrepreneurship popularized among the public, especially in students in universities. This analysis aims to ascertain how financial behavior and literacy, particularly among accounting students who are the sample of this study at West Java universities, affect entrepreneurial motivation. In addition, this research also examined the level of financial literacy and the level of financial behavior in accounting students in West Java, Indonesia. This research employs a quantitative approach and the data were collected using a survey questionnaire. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) method were used to analyze data of 252 respondents of accounting students from universities in West Java, Indonesia. The study discovered a significant positive association between financial literacy and accounting students' financial behavior and their willingness to start their own business. The research also assessed the degree of financial literacy and financial behavior among participants who achieved a relatively strong overall outcome, along with the level of drive for entrepreneurship among respondents with a similarly elevated average performance. This research contributes to educators and educational institutions that it is very important to design an integrated educational curriculum to strengthen the entrepreneurial motivation of accounting students who are the sample of this study at West Java universities in Indonesia.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL LITERACY AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, GRADUATES, AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS IN GERMANY
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - This research paper aims to examine various factors influencing the financial literacy of high school students, graduates, and young professionals. Although the academic literature has dealt extensively with the factors influencing financial literacy, no current study focuses on Germany and explicitly on the group of young people with an upper educational level. The empirical research undertaken primarily examines the influence of different manifestations of academic status, income, gender, and origin on the degree of financial literacy. In this context, financial literacy is approximated using the scientifically established set of questions, the so-called "Big Three" questions. A total of over 500 participants were surveyed. To evaluate the results, a simple linear regression model is formulated for each hypothesis and then tested for significance using the T-test. Subsequently, a multivariate regression model based on the significant influencing factors is specified and tested again. Thereby, the examined factor of gender is highly significant. Immigration background also influences financial literacy. Findings related to education, background, and income were often inconclusive or weak. No influence of the place of residence, the parent ' s educational level, or a practice-related education on financial literacy could be found.

T2  - STRATEGIC CHANGE-BRIEFINGS IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE
AB  - Different financial literacy models adopted by formal and semi-formal institutes have dissimilar impacts on individuals' decision-making and financial behavior. Individuals who participated in semi-formal financial literacy training are more likely to borrow than those who participated in the formal financial literacy training program. Decomposition suggests that people who participated in the formal financial literacy program are more likely to subscribe to insurance services than people trained from semi-formal financial literacy program. Individuals who participated in the semi-formal financial literacy training program are more satisfied with their current financial situation than those who participated in the formal literacy training program.

TI  - Homeownership and financial literacy: evidence from China in the perspective of 'learning by doing'
T2  - HOUSING STUDIES
AB  - Financial literacy is becoming an increasingly important policy consideration, yet its determinants are still underexplored. From the theoretical perspective of 'learning by doing', the effect of homeownership on financial literacy in urban China is identified by the instrumental variable strategy. First, the borrowing experience to purchase a home can awaken homeowners to develop basic financial knowledge, but the resulting debt burden constrains homeowners from participating in the financial market, crowding out their access to advanced financial skills. Second, the growth in home equity wealth induces homeowners pledge high-value properties as collateral and invest in more homes, in which case the collateralizing experience facilities the advancement of basic finance literacy, while locking the asset portfolio in the housing sector hinders homeowners from learning advanced financial skills. Moreover, the specific kind of financial literacy that homeowners show an advantage in differs depending on their income. These findings cast a new light on understanding the return of housing property to family financial affairs.

T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
AB  - Training programmes are popular development interventions that aim to address problems of youth unemployment. This paper estimates the impact of a youth entrepreneurship programme in Tanzania on financial literacy and employment knowledge. Using primary data within a successive cohort design in a community-led programme, the authors employed propensity score matching and fixed-effect estimation methods to assess changes in knowledge, skills and attitudes of marginalised youth. They found strong positive effects of the programme on key intermediate employment outcomes: savings ability, employment confidence and personal finance. The positive impact of this programme supports youth entrepreneurship training programme and non-experimental evaluation methods.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Network Competency, and SMEs Financial Performance: The Moderating Role of Market Orientation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - Research on SMEs highlights their limited resources and the influential role of SMEs' owners/managers. In this respect, scholars stressed the importance of different capabilities possessed by owners/managers of SMEs in developing a competitive position and enhancing firm performance. This study intended to examine the direct influence of two fundamental capabilities: financial literacy and networking competency possessed by owners/managers of SMEs in China and the United Arab Emirate (UAE) on SMEs' financial performance. In addition, this research tested the moderating impact of market orientation. The quantitative research method was employed by administering structured questionnaires. A total of 150 and 120 questionnaires were collected from owners/managers of SMEs in China and UAE. Structural equation modeling was used for data analysis using Smart-Pls. Findings revealed that SMEs' financial performance was positively related to maintaining financial literacy and networking competency in both samples. Further, market orientation was found to strengthen the positive impact of financial literacy and networking competency on SMEs' financial performance in China. However, market orientation had a significant moderating impact only on the relationship between networking and the financial performance of SMEs in the UAE. This paper ends with providing a set of concluding remarks, recommendations, and potential areas of further research.

AB  - In this paper, we study the relationship between financial literacy and self-employment. We use established financial literacy questions to measure literacy levels. The analysis shows a highly significant and positive correlation between the index and self-employment. We address the direction of causality by applying instrumental variable techniques based on information about maternal education. We also exploit information on financial support and family background to account for concerns about the exclusion restriction. The results provide support for a positive effect of financial literacy on the probability of being self-employed. As financial literacy is acquirable, the findings suggest that entrepreneurial activities might be increased by enhancing financial literacy.

TI  - Financial literacy, value creation and firm performance: an investigation of Italian small and medium enterprises
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP & SMALL BUSINESS
AB  - This article aims to determine the influence of entrepreneurs' financial literacy for the growth of SMEs' value. The paper verifies the hypothesis that there is a significant relationship between financial literacy and value creation, as indicated by economic value added (EVA (R)). The study analyses 162 Italian SMEs operating in the textile and clothing sector. The analysis period is between 2011 and 2013. Regression analysis and correlation analysis have been applied to test the hypotheses. The results suggest a positive and significant relationship between financial literacy and the variables that drive the value creation. Greater financial literacy allows SMEs to optimise their capital structure and select the most profitable projects. This work is useful to stimulate debate on the role of financial education in mitigating the difficulties of small and medium entrepreneurs in achieving value creation goals and in enabling policy makers to identify gaps and design appropriate responses.

TI  - Impact of religiosity and branding on SMEs performance: does financial literacy play a role?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING
AB  - Purpose This study aims to examine the relationship between religiosity and branding on small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs') performance in Saudi Arabia. It also examines the mediating role of financial literacy on the relationship among Islamic religiosity, branding and SMEs' performance.
   Design/methodology/approach This study adopts the purposive sampling technique in three major commercial cities, namely, Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Qassim to sample 100 SMEs each, resulting in a total sampling of 300 SMEs in Saudi Arabia. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze the hypotheses formulated in this study. The structural equation modeling is aided with the help of Smart-PLS software.
   Findings This study finds that Islamic branding (on customer, compliance and origin) significantly affect financial attitude, while Islamic religiosity affects financial awareness among the SMEs. Findings reveal that there is a mediating role of financial awareness on the relationship between Islamic branding and Islamic religiosity with the SMEs' performance. No mediation effect was recorded for financial attitude and financial knowledge. Further investigation reveals that financial attitude, financial awareness, Islamic branding (compliance and origin) and Islamic religiosity were the most significant determinants of SMEs' performance in the context of Saudi Arabia.
   Research limitations/implications This study is conducted on SMEs in Saudi Arabia only. Further studies are required to examine SMEs in other Islamic countries and regions to improve the explanatory power of financial literacy on Islamic religiosity and Islamic branding for improved SMEs performance.
   Originality/value This study establishes that Islamic religiosity and branding could further increase the predictive power of financial literacy on SMEs' performance. This study concludes that efforts to improve financial literacy should be religion-based as well as culture-based depending on where the SMEs are located so that specific strategies can be implemented, to enable the conducive growth of the SMEs and maximize the contribution of the SMEs to economic growth.

We use a sample of beneficiaries of a publicly run micro-entrepreneurship program. We evaluated the program using administrative data with information on the debt level, interest rates, and new loans provided by the formal sector. The program tends to decreased debt level in the short run while increasing the probability of having formal debt. The program had effects in parts of the country where the take-up was higher and the implementation was smoother.

TI  - The nexus between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success among young entrepreneurs from a low-income community in Cape Town: a mixed-method analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to explore the association between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success among young entrepreneurs within an economically disadvantaged community in Cape Town, South Africa.
   Design/methodology/approach - The mixed-method approach was adopted for the study. In-depth interviews were used in collecting the qualitative data while structured interviews using questionnaires were administered in collecting the quantitative data. The participants for the study were strictly young entrepreneurs.
   Findings - The study found that entrepreneurs understood the concept of financial literacy and this was corroborated by their financial literacy average score of 59.03, which is above the national financial literacy average score of 54.00. The study further revealed that a positive association exists between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success. Hence, high levels of financial literacy result in increased business success.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample size of the study was relatively small, for which reason, a mixed-method approach was adopted to strengthen the research findings. The research also considered only one disadvantaged community in South Africa (Khayelitsha).
   Originality/value - To the best of the knowledge, the influences of financial literacy on the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) among young entrepreneurs have not been well-explored in economically disadvantaged areas within the South African context. As a result, this study sheds light by assessing the level of financial literacy among young entrepreneurs in economically disadvantaged communities and by determining the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success. The study further provides recommendations on policy-making to ensure that through successful entrepreneurship, developmental challenges such as unemployment can be reduced.

TI  - Supporting SMEs Financial Resilience during Crises: A Framework to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Financial Literacy Programs Targeting SMEs
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - Financing capital investments and working capital have been the key challenges for small businesses during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. Excessive indebtedness can increase the fragility of firms, particularly during times of uncertainty. While there are several programs globally that target entrepreneurs' financial literacy, most of them do not take into consideration entrepreneurs' financial resilience during and after crisis times such as pandemics. The objective of this paper is to discuss the status of financial literacy programs targeting entrepreneurs. This paper conducts a review of the relevant literature to establish the initial understanding and then generates a framework consisting of entrepreneurs' financial literacy along with its components. This is done by carrying out qualitative content analysis of the various financial literacy initiatives targeting entrepreneurs in twenty countries globally to understand their target segments, scope, initiating organisations and limitations. The paper then suggests a framework for entrepreneurs' financial education that takes into consideration financial resilience during and after crisis situations in general and pandemics in particular.

Implementing the prospect theory and theory of planned behavior to explore these interactions, a series of hypotheses were constructed, considering financial risk tolerance and saving behavior as mediator variables and herding behavior as moderator variables. The study examined partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) obtained by sampling data from 388 entrepreneurs of medium-scale in the Bekasi Regency, Indonesia. The study revealed (a) how financial literacy on retirement planning is serial mediated by financial risk tolerance and saving behavior, (b) herding behavior can strengthen financial literacy's influence on retirement planning, and (c) saving behavior as a mediator does not influence the relationship between financial literacy and retirement planning. The study confirms how financial risk tolerance and herding behavior bridge a positive relationship between financial literacy and retirement planning.

TI  - Financial literacy, access to finance, SMEs performance and Islamic religiosity: evidence from Saudi Arabia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP & SMALL BUSINESS
AB  - This paper seeks to explore the impact of access to finance and financial literacy on the SMEs performance in an Islamic context. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design by employing 255 SMEs in Saudi Arabia. The findings showed a positive mediating effect of access to finance on the relationship between financial awareness, financial attitude and SMEs performance while access to finance does not mediate the nexus between financial knowledge and SMEs performance. Subsequently, the findings revealed that access to finance have positive effect on SMEs performance. This study also found that access to finance increases the positive relationship between financial literacy and SMEs performance. The role of religiosity was found to positively increase access to finance towards affecting SMEs performance. The findings of this study provide SMEs with the knowledge to increase their religious practices to access government Islamic funds, i.e., Mudarabah and Musharakah while Islamic banking firms should increase their Islamic products and services to attract SMEs in Saudi Arabia.

TI  - Propensity Score Weighting with Mismeasured Covariates: An Application to Two Financial Literacy Interventions
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Estimation of the causal effect of a binary treatment on outcomes often requires conditioning on covariates to address selection concerning observed variables. This is not straightforward when one or more of the covariates are measured with error. Here, we present a new semi-parametric estimator that addresses this issue. In particular, we focus on inverse propensity score weighting estimators when the propensity score is of an unknown functional form and some covariates are subject to classical measurement error. Our proposed solution involves deconvolution kernel estimators of the propensity score and the regression function weighted by a deconvolution kernel density estimator. Simulations and replication of a study examining the impact of two financial literacy interventions on the business practices of entrepreneurs show our estimator to be valuable to empirical researchers.

TI  - Effect of Financial Literacy on Starting a New Business: Using Survival Analysis to Examine Differences between Older and Younger Entrepreneurs
T2  - ESIC MARKET
AB  - Objective: This paper focuses on financial literacy as an antecedent to entrepreneurial involvement in order to examine and better understand differences between older and younger entrepreneurs. Financial literacy is the ability to apply the knowledge and skills needed to effectively manage financial resources over the life-course and is related to a wide range of economic outcomes.
   Methodology: The antecedence of financial literacy with respect to entrepreneurial engagement is examined using novel entrepreneurship data from the United States. The study uses three waves (2014, 2016, and 2019) of complex survey data from the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative and probability-based internet panel of households representing roughly 8,500 respondents ages 18 and older, and active since 2014. The data are used to generate survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method, and to run survey linear and Cox proportional hazards regression models where outcomes are starting a new business with respect to two time frames: over one's lifetime, and since 2014.
   Results: The results show that there are associations between financial literacy and the rate of starting a new business both over one's lifetime and since 2014, but only among older adults.
   Limitations: The study data were collected using a sample of adults in the United States which may limit the generalizability of the study findings to countries and regions other than the United States.

TI  - The role of entrepreneurship education in the entrepreneurial readiness of generation Z students: why do digital business literacy and financial literacy matter?
T2  - COGENT EDUCATION
AB  - Entrepreneurship has become a central issue in an effort to improve the nation's economic welfare. Several previous studies agree that the ideal country is one that has an entrepreneurial contribution of at least 4% of its total population. However, when compared with other countries, Indonesia's entrepreneurial contribution is currently still low because it has only reached an entrepreneurial ratio of 3.47%. One of the causes of this low contribution is the lack of effective entrepreneurship education. Some empirical evidence has not been able to explain how entrepreneurship education is able to prepare generation Z to become entrepreneurs through various new literacies. This research aims to investigate the influence of entrepreneurship education on the entrepreneurial readiness of generation Z students, which is moderated by digital business literacy and financial literacy. This research was conducted using a quantitative approach and involved 700 students in Makassar City, Indonesia. The data analysis technique used is partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis. Research findings show that entrepreneurship education plays an important role in the entrepreneurial readiness of generation Z students, which is strengthened by digital business literacy and financial literacy. The findings of this research can help expand and develop concepts related to digital business literacy and financial literacy in the context of entrepreneurship education in higher education, so that, by implication, this research provides a valuable contribution to entrepreneurship education, which paves the way for further research regarding entrepreneurial readiness in the context of diverse higher education through various other new literacies.

TI  - Influence of human capital and social capital on MSME access to finance: assessing the mediating role of financial literacy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThe authors investigate the role of financial literacy in influencing the relationship between human capital and social capital, with access to finance of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).Design/methodology/approachData were gathered from 337 MSMEs in Brunei Darussalam, and analysis on the data was carried out using a number of statistical methods. The relationships between human capital, social capital, financial literacy and access to finance were analyzed using PLS-SEM.FindingsThe results show that human capital does influence access to finance but contrary to previous studies, the influence is negative. Financial literacy is an important element in the relationship between human capital, social capital and access to finance, although it plays a greater role in the relationship between social capital and access to finance. Further analysis shows that financial knowledge is significant in moderating the relationships between human and social capital with access to finance. Financial skills is found to only moderate the relationship between social capital and access to finance.Originality/valueTo the authors' knowledge, this study is the first that integrates the human capital, social capital, financial literacy and access to finance in a single model. The authors also highlight the importance of enhancing the financial literacy of MSMEs so that the problem of access to finance can be alleviated, especially in developing countries.

TI  - Covid-19 and the changing face of financial literacy in India : Evidence from Delhi NCR during lockdowns
T2  - JOURNAL OF STATISTICS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
AB  - With a change in global market entanglement and composite retail financial products, financial literacy has gained distinction in the recent past. More importantly, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought attention to the preparation of individuals' financial budgets for unforeseen losses. As a result, financial literacy has gained immense importance. Literature available on the subject suggests that individuals when faced with a situation of crisis, tend to reduce their risk of not paying the liabilities, by controlling their budget. This research article aims to understand whether or not individuals with a good understanding of financial literacy have better skills in financial management, particularly during lockdowns. Primary data was collected after the second phase of lockdowns in August 2021 from 232 individuals residing in Delhi NCR, using a questionnaire adapted from the OECD study. Besides, a scale was developed to understand their financial behaviour and financial management skills. The results of the study indicate that a good understanding of financial principles helped manage financial risk effectively and avoid any financial pitfalls. It helps individuals avoid financial concerns and enable individuals to regulate their income, even in challenging conditions like the Covid-19 pandemic.

TI  - The Importance of Financial Literacy: Household's Income Mobility Measurement and Decomposition Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This study introduced income mobility analysis using pseudo-longitudinal panel data from Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) to consider the dynamic process of individual's well-being through time. Since there is no comprehensive measurement of income mobility because of its dynamic process, various income mobility indices such as Chi-square, Average Jump Index, Atkinson et al. Mobility Ratio, and Shorrocks' Mobility Index were used. These indices revealed that Filipino households' income movements are more mobile than expected, and their income status improved from 2000 to 2015. As income mobility takes place, income inequality is reduced by 91.80 percent (91.80%). Furthermore, the growth effect is the main factor of income mobility. This indicates that households took the economic opportunities from economic growth to earn more. However, income mobility due to transfer effect (transfer of income from one household to another through lottery winning and borrowing) increased when the economy is not good. The higher income mobility due to growth effect compared to transfer effect, whether the economy is good or bad, means that households learned how to use their income in savings, investments, and entrepreneurship. This is the result of a successful financial literacy program of the government wherein households realized financial stability and security.

TI  - Entrepreneurial financial literacy-small business sustainability nexus in Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study empirically examined the relationship between entrepreneurial financial literacy, access to credit, and the sustainability of small businesses in Ethiopia. The study used cross-sectional data collected from 293 owner-managers of small businesses through a survey questionnaire in 2022. It used structural equation modelling to analyze the results. Therefore, the paper's empirical evidence revealed that entrepreneurial financial literacy contributes to small business sustainability. The findings also show that access to formal credit financing mediates entrepreneurial financial literacy- small business sustainability nexus. In this regard, the paper contributes to the literature on small businesses by demonstrating the importance of entrepreneurial financial literacy and access to formal credit financing for the sustainability of small businesses in Ethiopia, considering the knowledge-resource-based view.

TI  - Developing the capability of digital financial literacy in developing countries: A Case of online loan for small entrepreneurs
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - The rapid growth of digital financial services especially during the COVID-19 outbreak, is a factor accelerating the use of online loan applications that inevitably require the knowledge of digital finance. This study used the behavior change theory and digital financial literacy to identify relevant and correlated variables to confirm positive motivational factors on digital financial skills and capability. Structure equation modeling (SEM) and path analysis were applied to find the correlation and confirm the proposed hypotheses presented. There were 400 samples of small entrepreneurs from different provinces, and online questionnaires were used for data collection. The findings showed that the knowledge and motivation variables were related and had a positive effect. It contributes to continuously building up the skills and capabilities of small entrepreneurs who need to develop their capabilities in digital financial literacy adequately in line with the changes in business and technology after the outbreak of COVID-19. This concept can apply to online loan policy for small entrepreneurs trained with motivating courses who accepted digital finance literacy's usefulness.

TI  - What makes equity crowdfunding successful in Japan? Testing the signaling and lack of financial literacy hypotheses
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND INNOVATION
AB  - PURPOSE: The first objective of this study is to identify the factors that contribute to the success of equity crowdfunding (ECF) campaigns in Japan. We examined what makes a campaign successful using data from 217 campaigns conducted on FUNDINNO, Japan's largest ECF platform, between February 2017 and May 2021. The second objective is to assess individual investors' financial literacy based on the ECF campaign's success or failure. This study is unique in that it focuses on funding method differences as well as the contents of the business plans disclosed in the ECF campaigns. In Japan, a common equity campaign and stock acquisition rights campaign are run on the same ECF platform, as if they were the same type of funding. Common stock and stock acquisition rights are treated differently by venture capitalists and other professional investors. By comparing the success or failure of the two Japanese projects, we can assess individual investors' financial literacy after taking into account the project signals. METHODOLOGY: The "Signaling Hypothesis" and the "Lack of Financial Literacy Hypothesis" were tested. Nine and four variables were set as proxy variables for the Signaling Hypothesis and the Lack of Financial Literacy Hypothesis, respectively. This study first divides the qualitative data into success/failure dichotomies for the proxy variables that comprise the hypotheses and then uses a chi-square test to examine the composition ratio of each. The quantitative data among the hypotheses' proxy variables are then tested for differences in means (t-test) and medians (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Subsequently, we perform a probit analysis with the explained variable being "success (1)/failure (0)" and the explanatory variable being a proxy variable for the hypothesis. We begin with a probit analysis, and the Logit model is then introduced. Finally, a multiple regression analysis is run with the explained variables "fundraising rate" and "number of investors" and the hypothesized proxy variables as explanatory variables. FINDINGS: We found that the "number of directors" is an effective management ability indicator of ECF success. In terms of start-up fundamentals, investors appear to accept the signals "intellectual property", "product releases" and "tax incentives." Awards affected the size of the final funding round. In contrast, B2C companies negatively signaled to private investors. The proxy variable "in final year sales" was supported concerning the lack of a financial literacy hypothesis. Individual investors can be assumed to be financially literate if they perform due diligence. However, since "expected rate of return (Internal Rate of Return, hereafter abbreviated as IRR)" and "common stock dummy" are uncorrelated, we can conclude that they do not demonstrate financial literacy in "valuation," nor whether or not the investment is profitable. Thus, individual investors' financial literacy in the Japanese ECF can be considered to be limited. IMPLICATIONS: We have demonstrated which signals investors in Japan's ECF campaigns respond to. These guidelines will be useful for future start-ups planning ECF campaigns. We were able to identify the lack of financial literacy among ECF individual investors. Therefore, for Japan's equity capital market to grow in the future, individual investors' financial literacy must be improved. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: With very limited analysis in Asia, home to the world's second-and third largest stock markets, we have identified the factors behind the success of Japan's ECF.
   Identifying success factors in a country like Japan, where many individual investors are extremely risk averse, will provide new insights. By comparing the success or failure of the two types of Japanese ECF projects (common equity projects and stock acquisition rights), we could test the financial literacy of individual investors, taking into account the project signals.

TI  - Preferences for ethical intermediaries and sustainable investment decisions in micro-firms: The role of financial literacy and digital financial capability
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - This study analyses the effects of financial literacy and digital financial capabilities in shaping entrepreneurs' preferences for ethical financial intermediaries and sustainable investment decisions. Exploiting novel survey data on Italian micro-enterprises, we find that more financially literate business owners have higher preferences for intermediaries with a strong ethical stance, are more likely to make investments inspired by environmental and social criteria and have a higher awareness of sustainable financial products. Moreover, digital financial competencies are found to play a significant role in enhancing preferences for ethical intermediaries and sustainable investment decisions. Finally, we show that the beneficial effect of financial literacy is mostly direct, while the indirect effect operating through higher digital financial abilities, despite being statistically significant, impacts firms' sustainable financing and investing decisions only to a lower extent.

TI  - Do Access to Finance, Technical Know-How, and Financial Literacy Offer Women Empowerment Through Women's Entrepreneurial Development?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The motivation of the study is to gauge the effects of access to finance, technical know-how, and financial literacy on women's empowerment through establishing women's entrepreneurial development. A sample of 950 women-owned SMEs was considered, and structured questionnaires were sent from getting target responses. After careful assessment through the data cleansing procedure, it was found that only 795 responses are suitable for further investigation, implying the sample response rate for the study is 74.71%. The study implemented structural equation modeling and multivariate regression analysis for gauging the causal association that is direct and indirect effects of target variables. According to findings, a positive statistically significant linkage was revealed with women's entrepreneurship sustainability and women empowerment. Furthermore, the mediating effects were also established for women's empowerment. According to the study findings, it is suggested that for women entrepreneurship sustainability, effective policies surrounding financing accessibility, technical knowledge expansion, and financial understating have to be promulgated in the economy, which allows bringing women empowerment at large.

TI  - Overconfidence heuristic-driven bias in investment decision-making and performance: mediating effects of risk perception and moderating effects of financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to show how overconfidence influences the decisions and performance of individual investors trading on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), with the mediating role of risk perception and moderating role of financial literacy. Design/methodology/approach The deductive approach was used, as the research is based on the theoretical framework of behavioural finance. A questionnaire and cross-sectional design were employed for data collection from the sample of 183 individual investors trading on the PSX. Hypotheses were tested through correlation and regression analysis. The Baron and Kenny method was used to test the mediation effect of risk perception and the moderation effect of financial literacy. The results of mediation and moderation were also authenticated through the PROCESS and structural equation modelling (SEM) technique. Findings The results suggest that risk perception fully mediates the relationships between the overconfidence heuristic on the one hand, and investment decisions and performance on the other. At the same time, financial literacy appears to moderate these relationships. The results suggest that overconfidence can impair the quality of investment decisions and performance, while financial literacy and risk perception can improve their quality. Practical implications The paper encourages investors to base decisions on their financial capability and experience levels and to avoid relying on heuristics or their sentiments when making investments. It provides awareness and understanding of heuristic biases in investment management, which could be very useful for decision makers and professionals in financial institutions, such as portfolio managers and traders in commercial banks, investment banks and mutual funds. This paper helps investors to select better investment tools and avoid repeating the expensive errors that occur due to heuristic biases. They can improve their performance by recognizing their biases and errors of judgment, to which we are all prone, resulting in better investment decisions and a more efficient market. The paper also highlights the importance on relying on professional knowledge, giving it greater weight than feelings and biases. Originality/value The current study is the first to focus on links between overconfidence, financial literacy, risk perception and individual investors' decisions and performance. This article enhanced the understanding of the role that heuristic-driven bias plays in the investment management, and more importantly, it went some way towards enhancing understanding of behavioural aspects and their influence on the investment decision-making and performance in an emerging market. It also adds to the literature in the area of behavioural finance specifically the role of heuristics in investment strategies; this field is in its initial stage, even in developed countries, while, in developing countries, little work has been done.

TI  - The nexus of digital financial inclusion, digital financial literacy and demographic factors: lesson from Indonesia
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study aims to answer the impact of digital financial literacy (DFL) and the demographic factors on digital financial inclusion (DFI). This model employed the independent variables that consist of digital financial literacy and demographic factors including gender, age, occupation, marital status, income. By applying purposive sampling, this study collected the data from 160 households who have minimum one banks' accounts. To answer the research hypotheses, this study analyzed the data using binary logistic regression that categorized sample into DFI or otherwise. Based on the model fit test, the findings showed that DFL and demographic factors affect DFI. The effect of gender and marital status showed an insignificant effect on DFI. Conversely, DFL and other demographic factors including age, income, occupation significantly explain DFI in Indonesian household. The model can predict 84.4% respondents in a correct classification as DFI or otherwise.
   This study highlights the impact of digital financial literacy (DFL) and demographic factors on digital financial inclusion (DFI) among Indonesian households. It contributes in filling the research gap which is conducted using entrepreneurial households. DFI has become a crucial factor to accelerate the economic growth especially for society who are financially excluded. Therefore, DFI is needed to support entrepreneurial household business activities. These findings underscore the importance of tailored financial literacy initiatives and inclusive policies to promote broader access to digital financial services, driving socioeconomic development in Indonesia and beyond.

TI  - How financial literacy moderates the relationship between qualitative business information and the success of an equity crowdfunding campaign: Evidence from Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperation Council countries
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - This paper presents empirical evidence suggesting that financial literacy moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship between the amount of qualitative business information provided and the success of an equity crowdfunding campaign. Drawing on a sample of 807 equity offerings posted on 26 platforms operating in 6 Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Cyprus, France, Israel, Italy, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates), the findings indicate that higher levels of financial literacy amplify the positive effect of more comprehensive qualitative business information. However, once a qualitative business information threshold is crossed, financial literacy results related to observed negative returns are even more substantial. These results, rooted into the signalling and information overload theoretical frameworks, offer valuable insights for entrepreneurs, platform administrators, investors and policymakers.

TI  - How Does Financial Literacy Affect Digital Entrepreneurship Willingness and Behavior-Evidence from Chinese Villagers' Participation in Entrepreneurship
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - How financial literacy (FL) can contribute to both digital entrepreneurship (DE) willingness and behavior has become a widely concerned and controversial topic among scholars and practitioners, one that is particularly relevant for bottom of pyramid (BOP) entrepreneurs. However, existing literature has not established a systematic theoretical framework for this issue, and its internal mechanism has not been thoroughly revealed. Hence, based on behavioral finance theory and digital business-related literature, we construct a multi-layer linear and mediated-moderation model that relates latent variables of FL, financial inclusion (FI), digital literacy (DL), and DE. A total of 664 villagers carrying out DE are the sample from China, and the empirical results mainly reveal the following: FL significantly improves the DE willingness and behavior, and the sense of FI plays a partial mediating role between FL and DE willingness and behavior. DL is a crucial influencing factor that moderates a positive effect between FL and DE willingness and behavior. Moreover, DL plays a mediated-moderating role. By contrast, FL in poverty-stricken counties (PSC) has a more substantial influence on DE than that in non-poverty-stricken counties (NPSC). If the family background (social capital) is superior (excellent), and the resources are abundant, then the influence of FL on DE will be stronger. This research contributes to the theories and practices related to FL, DE, FI, and DL.

TI  - Financial Literacy as a Key to Entrepreneurship Education: A Multi-Case Study Exploring Diversity and Inclusion
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - This article presents the results of the financial literacy assessment of young Mexican students between the ages of 17 and 24 enrolled in public and private institutions in five Mexican cities. This study's objective was to approach the financial knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes of young Mexicans through focus groups and questionnaires to identify their perceptions of complex thinking and its use for financial products and services. The most relevant findings suggest that (a) most of the young participants in the study use banking services through their parents, (b) there are significant gender differences in financial knowledge and behaviors, (c) critical thinking significantly and positively correlates with financial behaviors and attitudes, and (d) the level of critical thinking predicts financial behavior. There is a need to develop women's critical thinking to discern between the financial behavior they socially imitate and their capabilities to become more involved in financial issues, thus decreasing the gender gap.

TI  - The Effects of Financial Attitudes, Financial Literacy and Health Literacy on Sustainable Financial Retirement Planning: The Moderating Role of the Financial Advisor
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Financial planning for retirement is essential to ensure that people have enough money to live the lifestyle they desire when they retire. Self-employed business owners in developed countries widely do financial retirement planning. However, in Malaysia, the percentage of self-employed individuals concerned about financial retirement planning is lower than in other countries. This study aims to identify the relationship between the financial attitude, financial literacy and health literacy of self-employed individuals toward sustainable financial retirement planning in Malaysia and find out the moderating effect of the role of financial advisors. The study utilized structural equation modelling. Data were collected through a survey questionnaire and analyzed using SMART PLS 3.3. The total sample size was 416 self-employed individuals from the northern Malaysian region. The findings revealed that financial attitude and financial literacy significantly impact retirement planning. Moreover, the role of financial advisors moderates the relationship between financial attitude-financial retirement planning and financial literacy-financial retirement planning. The result of the study will fulfil the needs of self-employed individuals to plan their retirement by including the financial planning determinants needed for a well-planned retirement.

TI  - The Impact of Marketing Communication and Islamic Financial Literacy on Islamic Financial Inclusion and MSMEs Performance: Evidence from Halal Tourism in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The development of halal tourism in Indonesia is the focus of the Indonesian government and MSMEs have an important role in supporting the development of halal tourism in Indonesia. This study aims to examine the relationship between marketing communication and Islamic financial literacy on Islamic financial inclusion and MSME performance in the halal-tourism sector. A covariance-based SEM technique utilizing LISREL software was used to analyze the data from this investigation. Nonprobability sampling was employed to collect the data, and the sample consists of 152 halal-tourism entrepreneurs. This study found a positive and significant association between Islamic financial inclusion and business performance. This study also found that there is a positive and significant association between Islamic financial literacy and Islamic financial inclusion. Marketing communication and Islamic financial inclusion have a positive relationship, but it is insignificant. This study implies that to establish a halal-tourist ecosystem for long-term development in Indonesia, commercial actors must lend their full support. This study demonstrates that they can thrive when MSMEs in the halal-tourist ecosystem are backed by Islamic banking and Islamic rural banks. As a result, a more accommodating approach from Islamic banking is required to provide access to halal finance for business actors in Indonesia's halal-tourism ecosystem.

TI  - The interplay of skills, digital financial literacy, capability, and autonomy in financial decision making and well-being
T2  - BORSA ISTANBUL REVIEW
AB  - Covid-19 and the unprecedented surge in financial technology contributed to unexpected financial challenges, affecting the relevance of financial decision making and perceived financial well-being. This paper examines the mediating effects of digital financial literacy, financial autonomy, financial capability, and impulsivity on financial decision making and perceived financial well-being. The data come from 512 re-spondents in Delhi/NCR (National Capital Region), India, using a snowball-sampling technique and partial least squares structural equation modeling to test 13 structural hypotheses with SmartPLS3.3. Partial least squares (PLS) prediction is employed to estimate the out-of-sample predictive power of the proposed model. Our findings reveal that skills directly affect financial decision making and perceived financial well-being, and digital financial literacy emerges as a direct and mediating predictor of financial decision making. The dominance of financial capability and financial autonomy as mediators in financial decision making and financial well-being become more evident, and impulsivity fails to have mediating effects on financial decision making. The results have academic, regulatory, and managerial implications, all of which calls for more concerted efforts at recognizing the unique interaction among skills-financial decision making-perceived financial well-being, the cu-mulative effect of which enhances the critical ability to deal with environmental challenges, manage socioeconomic pressures in a sustainable manner, and translate the benefits into prudent gender-specific policy decisions and practices.Copyright (c) 2022 Borsa Istanbul Anonim S , irketi.

TI  - IMPACT OF DISTANT TEACHING DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON CIVIC AND FINANCIAL LITERACY
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021 resulted in the most significant disruption to school attendance in the history of humanity. Subsequent anti-pandemic caregivers demanded a shift to distance learning from kindergartens to higher education. Slovakia was one of the European Union countries with the most extended closed schools - 28 weeks. The main aim of the research was to analyze the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on education in the Slovak Republic by teaching civic and financial literacy in secondary schools in 2020-2021. In the form of in-depth interviews with selected teachers, the authors analyzed the actual state of education during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, the research showed that Slovakia was not prepared for the distance form of teaching. As a result, some children were educated in the form of self-study, some online, others combined, and some were not educated at all. Teachers used different didactic aids in online teaching; the competent state institutions published online textbooks only with hindsight. The global pandemic thus demonstrated shortcomings in the digitization of regional education. In the paper, the authors offer solutions for the future.

TI  - Knowledge creates value: the role of financial literacy in entrepreneurial behavior
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Under the backdrop of economic globalization and the digital economy, entrepreneurial behavior has emerged not only as a focal point of management research but also as an urgent topic within the domain of family finance. This paper scrutinizes the ramifications of financial literacy on household entrepreneurial behavior utilizing data from China's sample of the China Household Finance Survey spanning the years 2015 and 2017. Employing the ordered Probit model, we pursue our research objectives. Our findings suggest that financial literacy exerts immediate, persistent, and evolving positive effects on households' engagement in entrepreneurial activities and their proclivity toward entrepreneurship. Through the mitigation of endogeneity in the regression model, the outcomes of the two-stage regression corroborate the primary regression results. An examination of heterogeneity unveils noteworthy disparities between urban and rural areas, as well as gender discrepancies, in how financial literacy influences household entrepreneurial behavior. Furthermore, this study validates three potential pathways-namely income, social network, and risk attitude channels-demonstrating that financial literacy significantly augments household income, expands social networks, and enhances risk attitudes. Moreover, through supplementary analysis, we ascertain that financial education amplifies the impact of financial literacy on entrepreneurial behavior. Our study contributes to the enrichment of human capital theory and modern entrepreneurship theory. It advocates for robust efforts by governments and financial institutions to widely disseminate financial knowledge and foster family entrepreneurship, thereby fostering the robust and stable operation of both the global financial market and the job market.

TI  - The Impact of Financial Literacy on Entrepreneurial Intention: The Mediating Role of Saving Behavior
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This study explored the impact of financial literacy (financial awareness) on potential entrepreneurs' intent in Saudi Arabia. It also examined saving behavior as a mediator in the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurial intention. The study's data were collected by an online questionnaire sent to a sample of 270 potential entrepreneurs at Abqaiq Applied College, affiliated with King Faisal University. Data analysis was done using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). According to the findings, there is no direct relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurial intent. However, it has been reported that saving behavior can mediate between financial literacy and entrepreneurial intent.

TI  - Financial Literacy and the Impact of Movement Control Order (MCO) Among the Muslim Mompreneurs A Qualitative Study
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ECONOMICS-TUJISE
AB  - This empirical paper investigates how the mompreneurs manage their businesses during the Covid-19 lockdown and how the pandemic affects their family. The role of a mother in a family encompasses the livelihood of the family members, which extends to the family's financial standing. A mother's role in a family ranges from a homemaker and, to a certain extent, a financial provider. In Malaysia, it was reported in 2018 that 60.2% of entrepreneurs are housewives. However, it is believed that many women are working at and from home with high cost of living, especially in urban areas. They become home-based entrepreneurs, especially during this unprecedented pandemic, i.e. Covid-19, and restricted by the Movement Control Order (MCO). This study adopted an exploratory qualitative study whereby six (6) mompreneurs who are operating their businesses from home were interviewed to understand how the pandemic and the lockdown have affected their lives. This paper further examines their coping mechanism to the pandemic and financial income during this crisis. Mompreneurs' financial literacy is also observed in this paper to explore their financial understanding. This research is an exploratory study, and it only provides general ideas on how a home-based businesswoman survive and cope during the lockdown. The findings from this paper are suitable to be used as a benchmark for an extensive quantitative study in the future to further understand the behaviour of the mompreneurs, especially in Malaysia.

TI  - Keeping It Simple: Financial Literacy and Rules of Thumb
T2  - AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Micro-entrepreneurs often lack the financial literacy required to make important financial decisions. We conducted a randomized evaluation with a bank in the Dominican Republic to compare the impact of two distinct programs: standard accounting training versus a simplified, rule-of-thumb training that taught basic financial heuristics. The rule-of-thumb training significantly improved firms' financial practices, objective reporting quality, and revenues. For micro-entrepreneurs with lower skills or poor initial financial practices, the impact of the rule-of-thumb training was significantly larger than that of the standard accounting training, suggesting that simplifying training programs might improve their effectiveness for less sophisticated individuals.

TI  - Impact of financial literacy, perceived access to finance, ICT use, and digitization on credit constraints: evidence from Qatari MSME importers
T2  - FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB  - This study investigates the role of financial literacy (FL), perceived access to finance (PAF), information communication technology (ICT) usage, and digitization in alleviating the level of credit constraint that micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) face in an emerging market. We draw on the economic research theories of human capital, knowledge-based view, and lifecycle hypothesis to explain the relationship between the variables. Using survey data collected from 333 MSME importers in Qatar-a country with heavy reliance on foreign goods-we find strong evidence that FL, PAF, ICT usage, and digitization are key determinants of Qatari MSME access to credit. In particular, PAF and FL are significant and have their expected signs in almost all the Probit regressions. For ICT usage and digitization, although they are key determinants of credit constraints, the findings are more sensitive and dependent on the type of financing and the resulting type of credit constraint.

TI  - Changing Saving and Investment Behaviour: The Impact of Financial Literacy Training and Reminders on Micro-businesses
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - In developing countries, savings is an important financial tool, particularly for micro-business with limited access to credit. However, micro-entrepreneurs often undersave, even when they have some surplus and the desire to save. Knowledge gaps and behavioural biases such as limited attention have been discussed as potential constraints on saving. To test ways to alleviate such constraints, we offered a 4-hour financial literacy training and periodic SMS reminders for 3 months to a randomly selected group of micro-entrepreneurs in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We particularly compared the joint treatment to the two treatments in isolation for the first time in the literature. We find that SMS reminders increased savings relative to no treatment, and that the combination of reminders and financial training improved the financial literacy score and increased short-term deposits in the bank. Our results confirm earlier findings that savings can be limited by attention, and that financial literacy matters for saving behaviour when saving is at the top of the mind.

TI  - EMPLOYEE FINANCIAL LITERACY AND RETIREMENT PLAN BEHAVIOR: A CASE STUDY
T2  - ECONOMIC INQUIRY
AB  - This article uses administrative data on all active employees of the Federal Reserve (FR) System to examine participation in and contributions to the Thrift Saving Plan, the System's defined contribution (DC) plan. We link to administrative records a unique employee survey of economic/demographic factors including a set of financial literacy questions. Not surprisingly, FR employees are substantially more financially literate than the population at large. Most importantly, financially savvy employees are also most likely to participate in their DC plan. Sophisticated workers contribute three percentage points more of their earnings to the DC plan than do the less knowledgeable, and they hold more equity in their pension accounts. We examine changes in employee plan behavior 1 year after employees completed a Learning Module about retirement planning, and we compare it to baseline patterns. We find that those employees who completed the Learning Module were more likely to start contributing and less likely to have stopped contributing to the DC plan postsurvey. In sum, employer-provided learning programs are shown to significantly impact employee retirement saving decisions and consistent with a lot of other research, higher levels of financial literacy are found to have a beneficial impact on retirement saving patterns.

TI  - Financial literacy programs and youth entrepreneurial attitudes: some insights from the Jordanian community
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of a financial literacy program (FLP) recently implemented in Jordanian junior high and high schools as part of a national financial literacy agenda on students' attitudes toward entrepreneurship relative to a control sample of students who had not yet participated in the FLP. This paper also examines the role of moderating variables, including students' perception of teachers' attitudes (TA) on students' entrepreneurial attitudes.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Survey methodology was used to obtain data and hierarchical regression analysis was used to test hypotheses.
   Findings
   Results indicate that students who completed the FLP exhibited significantly higher entrepreneurial awareness than those that had not yet participated in the program. Students who took the entrepreneurship module of the FLP exhibited significantly lower entrepreneurial intention than those that had not yet taken the entrepreneurship module. However, TA did not impact students' attitudes.
   Research limitations/implications
   The study examines a sample of middle and high school students in only one district in Amman, Jordan, and cannot be generalized to other communities where the FLP has been implemented.
   Practical implications
   The findings provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers and non-governmental organizations considering large scale, publicly funded FLPs as part of the K-12 educational system.
   Social implications
   Stakeholders should consider reforms to the implementation of entrepreneurship education as part of the FLP in Jordanian schools and other developing country K-12 programs.
   Originality/value
   This study is the first to examine the new Jordanian literacy program and the impact it has on attitudes toward entrepreneurship of middle and high school students.

TI  - Entrepreneurship as a Neglected Pitfall in Future Finnish Teachers' Readiness to Teach 21st Century Competencies and Financial Literacy: Expectancies, Values, and Capability
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine entrepreneurship in the context of future Finnish teachers' readiness to teach 21st century (broad-based) competencies. Teachers' self-efficacy in teaching entrepreneurial skills and financial matters is vital for their pupils to actively participate and flourish in future society. The study utilized survey data of future teachers' expectancy-values in teaching seven broad-based competencies of the current national curriculum and their financial literacy. Future teachers expressed high interest in all competencies but reported the least self-efficacy and highest cost in teaching ICT as well as working life and entrepreneurship competencies. Teaching self-efficacy (TSE) in entrepreneurial competencies was predicted by subjective evaluations of financial capability and TSE in consumer skills. Teaching STEM subjects as well as male gender were related to better objective financial knowledge. We discuss the implications of observed financial capability, lack in self-efficacy, and high experienced cost of teaching these competencies. Support for future teachers' readiness to teach working life skills, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy through phenomenon-based school subject collaboration, formal teacher training, and digital applications are emphasized.

TI  - Does intention influence the financial literacy of depositors of Islamic banking? A case of Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose Since the establishment of Islamic banks in Malaysia since the 1980s, the banking system has undergone rampant development within the financial industry. It has resulted in a positive competitive challenge for the conventional banks and able to attract not just the Muslim customers, but also those non-Muslim customers. At the same time, understanding the customers' knowledge of Islamic banking products is an interesting issue to explore. This issue is raised because the Islamic bank products are often packaged using Arabic terms, even though it is marketed in non-Arabic countries like Malaysia. Therefore, this study aims to examine the factors that influence the intention of the Islamic banking customers as the result of relying on some information produced by Malaysian Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach This study is conducted using the existing underpinning theory of planned behaviour (TPB). A total of 300 questionnaires were analysed using the structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings The results indicated that perceived behavioural control, attitude and subjective norms of the Islamic banking depositors are positively influenced by the intention of the depositors to learn about Islamic banking. Research limitations/implications One of the main issues faced in this study is the result cannot be generalised. It is not possible to know based on the collected data if the sample is representative, other than the fact that all of the respondents are Islamic bank depositors. Nevertheless, it can still be a catalyst for further research as a link to existing findings in the area. There might be a bias on the understanding of the respondents about Islamic banking. This is due to the fact that Malaysia is a multi-racial population. Malay people might have a better understanding and basic knowledge about Islamic banking than the Chinese, Indians and other races. This cultural bias could be overcome in future studies by identifying respondents who have experiences in dealing with Islamic banking. Originality/value This study provides interesting insights of the Malaysian banking industry in terms of the multi-racial customers' intention to learn about Islamic banking, which is scarcely discussed in the extant literature.

TI  - Entrepreneurs on their financial literacy: evidence from the Netherlands
T2  - VENTURE CAPITAL
AB  - Using a representative survey of Dutch entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals, (i) we measure their subjective financial knowledge and the extent to which they ask for advice when managing their companies, and (ii) we examine whether subjective financial knowledge and the demand for advice are related to the firm economic performance. We find that the respondents feel more comfortable with accounting subjects than they do with strategic ones, of which they feel that they know the least. Entrepreneurs with a greater extent of financial knowledge are more likely to report a higher gross margin and higher revenue growth for their firm. These entrepreneurs are also less likely to seek advice and to delegate financial decisions. Seeking professional advice does not increase the likelihood of an entrepreneur having better performance. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs' degree of financial knowledge is related to the success of their businesses, while seeking advice is not significantly correlated with better firm performance.

TI  - A STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL OF FINANCIAL MSMES PERFORMANCE: MODERATION BY ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS
T2  - JIMS8M-THE JOURNAL OF INDIAN MANAGEMENT & STRATEGY
AB  - mercialSale dated17-Nov-2020on In order to remain creditworthy and investable, the entrepreneurs should be able to produce high quality and standardised financial information on a regular basis. This information can be fed further into formal business plans in order to optimise management decisions and improve business processes. The critical question that needs to be answered is: Do the entrepreneurs possess adequate financial literacycompetencies, to gather and utilize the financial information, to achieve their business objectives? Does their level of financial literacy significantly explain their use of information technology for gaining competitive advantage? With the introduction of GST, there has been a change in the accounting environment of business through increased usage of computerised accounting systems (CAS) and heavy reliance on accountants for this purpose. This paper specifically aims to assess the financial literacy skills of MSME entrepreneurs in creation and utilisation of financial information using CAS and digital skills, to achieve better financial management and control over business activities. The structural model developed in this paper confirmed the positive association of financial accounting practices and use of IT with the business performance of MSMEs. Since entrepreneurial skills are intended to complement the financial literacy competencies of entrepreneurs, the paper also examined and confirmed the moderating effect of entrepreneurial skills on financial accounting practices and business performance relationship. 2 N a

T2  - SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL
AB  - PurposeGrounded in upper echelon (UE) theory, this study aims to examine the role of managerial competencies (business experience, financial literacy and digital literacy) in sustainable development strategy, with resource management as a mediator.Design/methodology/approachThe empirical data collection is conducted through a survey completed by 297 top management teams of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in Pakistan. Structural equation modelling in Smart PLS is used to substantiate the hypotheses.FindingsThe findings reveal that financially and digitally literate managers significantly contribute to the sustainable development strategies of SMEs. However, experienced managers do not focus significantly on sustainable development strategies. Resource management partially mediates the nexus between financial literacy and sustainable development strategy, as well as between digital literacy and sustainable development strategy. In contrast, resource management does not mediate the nexus between business experience and sustainable development strategy.Research limitations/implicationsThis study recommends that SMEs should prioritize managers with digital and financial literacy over those with experience. SMEs led by a management team with digital and financial literacy are more effective in resource management for sustainable development practices, whereas experienced managers may not significantly prioritize managing resources for sustainability.Originality/valueWhile research based on the UE theory significantly contributes to the body of knowledge on sustainable development, the role of managerial competencies, particularly business experience, financial literacy and digital literacy, in sustainable development strategy via resource management is neglected. This research fills this gap in the context of UE theory and thereby enriches the literature.

TI  - Hubris or talent? Estimating the role of overconfidence in Chinese households' investment decisions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - We document the extent to which overconfidence in one's financial literacy (FL overconfidence) plays a role in households' reported financial risk aversion and their actual investment behavior, using data from the China Household Finance Survey. We measure FL overconfidence by estimating the gap between people's self-reported financial literacy and their objectively measured financial knowledge. Our results indicate that FL overconfidence is negatively associated with self-reported financial risk aversion. Additionally, FL overconfidence is positively associated with the likelihood of having a brokerage account, holding risky financial instruments (other than just stock), and a proportion of assets allocated towards risky assets. We then use machine learning methods to predict which factors are most important in determining households' risky investment decisions. We find that overconfidence plays a significant predictive role. Our work signals that households' risky investments may be driven by biased optimism about their own financial know-how rather than their actual knowledge. We conclude that financial literacy programs should not only teach financial concepts but also make program participants aware of their own biases.

TI  - Social Capital and Household Economic Welfare: Do Entrepreneurship, Financial and Digital Literacy Matter?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Alleviating household economic fragility and poverty is a global challenge in achieving a nation's well-being. This study aims to examine the impact of social capital and Indonesian household economic welfare, as well as understand the mediating role of entrepreneurial, digital, and financial literacy. To address this objective, a structural equation modeling partial least square was adopted to acquire comprehend findings. The survey data were gathered from households in East Java of Indonesia using a simple random sampling approach. The findings from this study highlight that social capital significantly influences several literacies of households in Indonesia, including digital literacy, financial literacy, and entrepreneurial literacy. However, this study failed to confirm the nexus between social capital and household economic welfare. In addition, financial literacy, digital literacy, and entrepreneurial literacy all play an important role in mediating the connection between social capital and the economic welfare of households.

TI  - Women entrepreneurs' success factors of Northern Indian community: a person-environment fit theory perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
AB  - Purpose Women entrepreneurs contribute significantly to Asian economies. However, women in this region face an alarming array of barriers to entrepreneurship. This research study aims to examine the factors, i.e. government support, family social support, financial literacy and managerial skills, in building the entrepreneurial capacity of women entrepreneurs under the lens of the person-environment (P-E) fit theory. Furthermore, the study also examines the moderating effect of socio-cultural barriers in the said relationships. Design/methodology/approach For the study, the data was collected from the owners of 311 women-owned manufacturing and services sector enterprises from the northern Indian community. Findings Findings suggest that all the factors significantly affect the entrepreneurial capacity of women entrepreneurs, and the barriers work as a moderator between the relationships. Originality/value Based on P-E fit theory, this unique research study proposes a model to test the role of factors such as government support, family social support, financial literacy and managerial skills in developing women entrepreneurs' entrepreneurial capacity along with examining the moderating role of socio-cultural factors contributing to the entrepreneurial capacity of women.

TI  - Determinants of knowledge of personal loans' total costs: How price consciousness, financial literacy, purchase recency and frequency work together
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
CP  - Annual Conference of Business Association for Latin American Studies (BALAS) - From Starting Up to Sustained Growth - Challenges and Opportunities for Latin American Entrepreneurs
AB  - Politicians and analysts frequently call for stricter regulation of personal loans. Two variables that are easy to measure, and therefore easy to include in regulations and public policy, are purchase recency and purchase frequency. Politicians and analysts also regularly demand an increase in price consciousness and financial literacy among customers. This paper aims to analyze how these four factors work together to generate perceived and actual knowledge of the personal loans' total costs. An empirical study employing a survey administered through personal in-home interviews was carried out. This paper shows how perceived and actual knowledge of personal loans' total costs are affected differently by these four factors. The results are discussed, and implications for regulators, managers, and researchers are presented.

TI  - Measuring financial divide in the rural environment. The potential role of the digital transformation of finance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - Financial inclusion, which means the promotion of an affordable, timely and adequate access to a wide range of regulated financial products and services, as well as its use by all the segments of the society, is a high potential tool that may contribute to the development of the rural environment, while its absence could in turn cause a major harm. The availability of a sufficient level of financial literacy, which can be defined as the ability to understand financial concepts and risks, as well as the motivation and trust to use it when making financial decisions, is frequently deemed to be a need to reach financial inclusion by the academic literature. Financial literacy is, in turn, influenced by different variables, such as the degree of rural or urban predominance, the level of education and the available income in the household. This paper analyses the impact of such factors on financial literacy. The degree of financial literacy tends to be lower in rural environments, with limited incomes and poorer educational backgrounds, which creates a vicious circle that potentially worsens the situation of what has been called the empty Spain. Considering the importance of financial literacy to reach financial inclusion, we remark the potential of digital transformation as a valuable tool to break this negative trend in the less populated Spanish regions, and so, a cornerstone for the regenerative development of the Spanish rural areas.

TI  - Digital financial inclusion, traditional finance system and household entrepreneurship
T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - This study examines the impact of digital financial inclusion (DFI) on household entrepreneurship and the role of the traditional finance system (TFS). The results show that a 1% increase in DFI increases entrepreneurship by 0.264%. Improved willingness to borrow and financial literacy enhance DFI's effect. DFI and TFS have a willingness to borrow competitive relationship but a financial literacy synergistic relationship. The DFI-TFS relationship exhibits heterogeneity based on the rural-urban divide, bank types, and entrepreneurial motivations. These findings offer insights into the interplay between DFI and TFS in promoting household entrepreneurship.

TI  - FINANCIAL PLANNING IN SLOVAKIA: RESULTS OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH *
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - In this paper, we have highlighted one of today's most critical issues: financial literacy and its importance in our lives. According to several studies, financial literacy needs to be at the appropriate level, not only among the younger but also among the middle and older generations. Financial literacy is the knowledge that allows people of different ages to understand the workings and importance of finances. It helps people make the right decisions in appropriate situations. Finance is a part of everyone's life. Daily, we perceive their importance concerning current spending and the financial concepts to which people are exposed at every step. We have analysed the population's financial literacy and financial planning, which contains Slovakian households, especially in the case of the young generations. Our goal was to have a sample size of at least 400 people, and our sample size was 463 people. As we applied snowball sampling, our research can not be considered representative. Collected data were analysed in statistical software and commented. While the older generation is more attentive to planning for their retirement, even if they cannot always stick to the plan they have set, they also design their spending goals to a greater extent.

TI  - Schoolteachers' experiences of knowledge sharing when teaching new education programs
T2  - JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to explore schoolteachers' experiences of knowledge sharing as a source of informal learning in the workplace when teaching new education programs on financial literacy and entrepreneurial skills. Design/methodology/approachThis study is based on interviews with American schoolteachers teaching education programs provided by Junior Achievement USA that aim to equip pupils with practical skills in financial literacy and entrepreneurship to improve their work-readiness in adult life. FindingsThe findings of this study indicate that knowledge sharing is a source of informal learning among the teachers when dealing with the JA programs. This takes place through collaboration in communities of practice. Experienced teachers (who have previously taught the programs) are especially valuable in sharing their insights and helping the teachers prepare their teaching. Such knowledge-sharing practices help the schoolteachers to improve their practices. Having a supportive social culture encourages knowledge sharing between schoolteachers, but more time is needed to prioritize this kind of collaboration between co-workers. Originality/valueTeaching financial literacy and entrepreneurship through pupil-driven activities can be experienced as different from teaching regular subjects, and teachers in the study seem to benefit from sharing experiences when it comes to preparing or adding to their teaching. The findings suggest that to facilitate knowledge-sharing practices can be helpful to schoolteachers when introducing new topics and pedagogical methods in schools.

TI  - Framing the Retirement Planning Behavior Model towards Sustainable Wellbeing among Youth: The Moderating Effect of Public Profiles
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study examines the effect of financial literacy, saving attitudes, social influence, and goal clarity on the retirement planning construct. In addition, it investigates how the public demographic profile moderates these relationships. The questionnaire approach was utilized to collect data by adopting and customizing the measurement scale from previous studies. A systematic random sampling approach was employed on 323 prospective respondents. The outcomes of this study illustrate that all relationships are significantly and positively associated with retirement planning using structural equation modeling (SEM). Furthermore, all moderator variables (gender, age, status, income, and education) moderated the relationships. The government should construct a holistic retirement planning model that is based on demographic characteristics.

TI  - Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy and Financial and Calculation Skills Can Shape Different Profiles of Venture Intentions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - The complexity of finances and access to financial markets is one of the main challenges facing an entrepreneur. However, not many studies examine the effect of financial skills on entrepreneurial intentions. Our research describes venture intentions, considering motivations, contextual factors and personal traits in different clusters, based on the strong sense of entrepreneurial self-efficacy and the levels of financial literacy and numeracy skills. Results demonstrate that financial and numeracy skills and self-efficacy shape different profiles of potential entrepreneurs. The study shows that social motivations exert a favourable impact on entrepreneurial intentions only for those who firmly believe in their abilities or have high financial and numeracy skills. For those without outstanding skills or high self-efficacy, contextual factors play a key role in the decision to launch a new venture.

TI  - Assessing pharmacists' awareness of financial indicators in community pharmacy management: A cross-sectional study
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Background: Community pharmacists play a vital role in the healthcare system, serving as accessible healthcare providers and entrepreneurs. To effectively manage community pharmacies, pharmacists must possess financial literacy and utilize appropriate financial indicators. However, studies addressing community pharmacists' awareness of financial indicator concepts are scarce. This study assesses the awareness of community pharmacists in Jordan regarding financial indicators. Methods: Employing a cross-sectional study design, we utilized a structured and validated questionnaire to collect data from 353 community pharmacy owners across Jordan. The questionnaire assessed pharmacists' awareness and utilization of financial indicators in pharmacy management. Descriptive statistics summarized demographic data, while analytical statistics examined associations between demographic factors and financial indicator awareness. Results: The study revealed varying levels of awareness among pharmacists regarding financial indicators, with younger pharmacists exhibiting higher awareness levels. Factors such as educational background and years of experience were found to influence awareness. Furthermore, pharmacists predominantly utilize profitability indicators to assess financial performance. Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of enhancing pharmacists' financial literacy and integrating financial management principles into pharmacy education. Continuous professional development programs are essential to improve financial competence among pharmacists. This study provides valuable insights into the awareness of financial indicators among community pharmacists in Jordan, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts from policymakers, pharmacy faculties, and associations to enhance financial education and promote research in this critical area.

TI  - The financial ambidexterity of the immigrant entrepreneurs: a conceptualization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR & RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose Access to financing has long been identified as a stumbling block for the economic endeavors of immigrant entrepreneurs (IEs) in host countries. Yet, little is known about the internal enablers for the IEs success to overcome their financing barriers in host countries. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to introduce the theoretical concept of the financial ambidexterity of IEs as a potential behavioral ability some IEs develop over time to access financing in both host and coethnic contexts. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses sociopsychological lenses to introduce and discuss the term "financial ambidexterity of IEs" by synthesizing empirical evidence drawn from the different literature on immigrant entrepreneurship, biculturalism, financial literacy and cultural intelligence. This discussion is carefully embedded within the framework of the immigrant entrepreneurship literature. Findings The study proposes and discusses the role of bicultural identity integration, cultural intelligence and financial literacy in enabling the "financial ambidexterity of IEs." It further defines the "financial ambidexterity of IEs" as their ability to explore and exploit financing opportunities, either simultaneously across the contexts within which they are embedded, e.g. coethnic and mainstream, or alternately in one context when barriers occur in the other. Originality/value The paper mainly contributes to the literature on immigrant entrepreneurship by suggesting an explanation for how IEs overcome financing barriers in their host countries, and why some IEs are more successful in that than other peers. Moreover, the paper attempts to advance the understanding of immigrants' entrepreneurial endeavors using a sociopsychological lens that considers cultural, cognitive and knowledge-related factors.

TI  - Who Lacks Pension Knowledge, Why and Does it Matter? Evidence From Swedish Retirement Savers
T2  - PUBLIC FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Recent pension reforms have shifted a larger responsibility towards savers. Individuals therefore need better knowledge of the rules and incentives embedded in the pension system to adequately save and prepare for retirement. In this paper, we use a novel Swedish survey matched with high-quality administrative data to show that many lack, and feel that they lack, such pension-specific knowledge. We also show that the most economically vulnerable groups know the least. Linking pension knowledge to behavior, we find that knowing less is associated with lower preparedness for retirement, even after controlling for financial literacy and subjective knowledge. Moreover, a large majority state the complexity of the pension system, or that they have planned to learn more about pensions but that it just hasn't happened, as reasons for why they do not have sufficient knowledge.

TI  - Analysing the behavioural, psychological, and demographic determinants of financial decision making of household investors
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Adding to the behavioural science domain, the principal idea behind the study is to investigate the impact of an array of behavioural, psychological, and demographic factors on financial de-cision making. The study utilizes a structured questionnaire to collect the opinions of 634 in-vestors using a blend of random and snowball sampling techniques. The partial least squares structural equation modelling has been used to test hypotheses. PLS Predict has been applied to estimate the out-of-sample predictive power of the proposed model. Finally, the multi-group analysis has been applied to assess the differences across gender. Our findings attest the rele-vance of digital financial literacy, financial capability, financial autonomy, and impulsivity on financial decision making. Additionally, financial capability partially mediates the nexus between digital financial literacy and financial decision making. Also, Impulsivity negatively moderates the relationship between financial capability and financial decision making. The overall results of this comprehensive and unique study portray the influence that various psychological, behav-ioural, and demographic factors have on financial decision making, favouring the design of a feasible and lucrative financial portfolio to ensure financial well-being of households in the long run.

TI  - Perception of sources of private wealth. A qualitative study of perceptive schemes of Western and Eastern Bloc students
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Over the recent years, money has become one of the most compelling topics in modern societies. Consequently, financial literacy turns out to be an indispensable ability in today's complex reality. Numerous studies reveal that the level of financial literacy is dependent on the socio-economic context in which the financial experience is formed. Against this background, this study aims to verify how the specific socio-economic context affects the perception of students with regard to the main sources of private wealth in the Western and Eastern Bloc countries. The research problem focuses on the following question: Do students' perceptions precisely reflect the economic reality in their countries? Data from 115 essays written by students from Poland, Austria, Russia, The Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, and Ukraine were analyzed using directed qualitative content analysis. A structured matrix of four predetermined sources of wealth - CEO compensation, financial trading, entrepreneurship, and inheritance - was developed and subsequently compared with students' observations. As a result, two conceptual models were developed presenting differences in the perceptive schemes of Western and Eastern Bloc students. Then the perceptions were compared with empirical data from the Forbes list of billionaires. This paper provides an example of how essays written by students can become a source of empirical research. Its added value lies in showing the usefulness of directed qualitative content analysis in socio-economic studies.

TI  - DO WOMEN BEHAVE FINANCIALLY WORSE THAN MEN? EVIDENCE FROM MARRIED AND COHABITING COUPLES
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Extensive empirical evidence shows that women perform worse in financial literacy tests, which implies that their financial behaviour may also be worse compared to men. However, the literature on the gender gap in financial behaviour is scanty and highly inconclusive. Using data from a survey of married and cohabiting couples living in Poland (N=1,000) and a multi-dimensional scale validated in terms of its psychometric properties, this article compares the financial behaviour of women and men. The applied tests did not show any significant gender differences in the overall financial behaviour index or in any of the subdomains of the behaviour distinguished in the applied scale. Using the social identity theory as a framework, we discuss possible explanations of these puzzling findings, which may imply that women are unnecessarily considered a disadvantaged group in terms of preparedness to participate in financial life, including the business sphere.
   Implications for Central European audience: Assuming that the gender differences in financial literacy and behaviour can be explained on the grounds of the social identity theory, Central and Eastern Europe may differ from Western Europe in terms of the gender gap. Socially-imposed gender roles were presumably shaped differently behind the Iron Curtain, which resulted in that the distinction between masculine and feminine roles got blurred under the Soviet regime. As a result, the absence of gender differences in financial behaviour is more likely to occur in Central and Eastern European countries. Financial education initiatives should take this circumstance into account.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - This study aims at investigating the financial knowledge, financial behaviour and the attitude towards finance amongst on small medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) in Kuching. More specifically on how these powerful factors affect the profitability on fast growing business enterprises in largest city in the Borneo Island over the last decade. The research takes a descriptive approach fitting its underlying pursue and draws interesting conclusions with over 75% response rate. Analysis of the data collected clearly reveals that the knowledge of finance in general relates significantly stronger to the bottom line of these business entities relative to the owners' financial attitude and their ensuing behaviour towards financial decision making. Therefore, small medium entrepreneurs are highly recommended to participate in financial education on a regular basis to keep them well informed and equipped with the latest ways of managing the finances of their businesses to ensure better financial planning, execution and monitoring of enterprises that inevitably will lead to increased and sustainable earnings.

T2  - DIGITAL POLICY REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE
AB  - PurposeCryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly attractive as alternatives to traditional currencies. Although many retailers accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in online shopping, consumers' cryptocurrency adoption intention in online shopping (CCAI) is still low. This study aims to investigate the influence of attitudes, subjective norms, consumer trust, financial literacy and fear of missing out (FOMO) on CCAI.Design/methodology/approachA quantitative research approach was followed using a consumer survey. Hypothesized relationships were tested through regression and mediation analyses.FindingsThe results revealed that consumers could accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in online shopping. Attitudes, subjective norms, consumer trust and financial literacy directly and positively influence CCAI, while they indirectly affect CCAI through the mediating impact of FOMO.Practical implicationsMarketing managers should improve consumers' knowledge about cryptocurrencies and trust in online shopping to increase CCAI. Social media marketing can be appropriate, while the advertising content can address keeping up with others and staying connected.Originality/valueThis study addresses a critical gap in the literature by empirically examining the antecedents of CCAI within an original conceptual model based on the theoretical framework provided by the theory of planned behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, trust and financial literacy influence CCAI, where FOMO plays a significant role as a mediator.

TI  - Keeping it in the family: financial constraints and the succession intention of micro and small enterprises in China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - Despite the significance of business succession in the family firm literature, few studies have paid attention to the role of financial constraints, a common feature of micro and small firms, in entrepreneurs' succession intention. Using a nationally representative survey of micro and small firms in China, we find that a higher degree of financial constraints significantly strengthens the entrepreneur's intention of passing the firm on to the next generation. Moreover, the effect of financial constraints works particularly for firms whose entrepreneurs possess lower levels of financial literacy and for firms in regions with less-developed financial markets. Our results still hold after addressing potential endogeneity problems and conducting a wide array of robustness checks.

TI  - Personal finance apps and low-income households
T2  - STRATEGIC CHANGE-BRIEFINGS IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE
AB  - The use of personal finance smartphone apps results in an improvement in various measures used to assess financial knowledge and skills, attitudes and motivations, and financially capable behaviors for those in low-income households. Those provided with smartphone apps demonstrated increased self-confidence in financial decision-making and financial literacy and improved their ability to delay self-gratification and their sense of being able to effect change. Financially capable behavior changes manifested in being better able to keep track of finances and manage unexpected bills. User engagement with finance apps could be improved by targeting users with a specific financial decision-making problem, personalizing the apps through push notifications to encourage ongoing user engagement, and incorporating game mechanics.

TI  - Impact of E-Commerce Adoption on Farmers' Participation in the Digital Financial Market: Evidence from Rural China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB  - Although the increasing adoption of digital finance in recent years has exerted a wide-ranging influence on farmers' consumption and production activities, many farmers in China still seriously suffer from digital financial exclusion. Few studies have documented the different impacts of e-commerce adoption characterized by online purchases and sales on farmers' participation in the digital financial market measured by their engagement in digital payments, digital wealth management, and digital credit in rural China. Using survey data from 832 entrepreneurial households in rural China, we contribute to the literature by confirming that both online purchases and sales have a robust significant and positive impact on farmers' participation in the digital financial market and that this impact on digital wealth management is successively larger than that on digital payments and digital credit, with the propensity score matching (PSM) method and instrument variable (IV) approach employed. We further discover that the impact of online purchases and sales on farmers' participation in the digital financial market is significantly mediated by digital financial literacy. Moreover, the impact of online purchases and sales on farmers' participation in the digital financial market is larger for those with high education levels, pursuing skills training, running new agricultural operation entities (i.e., family farms, professional cooperatives), and engaging in agricultural entrepreneurship. Our findings suggest that more effective measures to enhance adoption rates of online purchases and sales, innovation in rural market-oriented digital financial products and services, systematic training for farmers in e-commerce skills as well as digital financial literacy, and differentiated support measures for different groups of farmers to reduce the gap are urgently needed in China.

TI  - Teachers' views on the role of economic and management sciences in preparing learners for accounting in the Further Education and Training Phase
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB  - With this study we explored teachers' views on the role of economic and management sciences (EMS) in preparing learners for accounting in the Further Education and Training (FET) Phase. A qualitative research approach was employed along with the interpretivist paradigm to underpin the study. We used a qualitative case study approach to allow for an in-depth understanding of the views of the teachers by talking to them directly. Semi-structured individual and focus-group interviews were used as data collection methods. Participants in the study included 5 Grade 9 EMS teachers and 5 Grade 10 accounting teachers who were conveniently and purposively sampled from 5 secondary schools. A thematic analysis approach was adopted to analyse the interview responses. The findings of the study reveal that teachers understood that EMS was an integrated subject. However, Grade 9 teachers struggled to teach EMS in an integrated manner and this hampered the teaching of financial literacy. The challenges in teaching EMS are aggravated by the lack of relevant pedagogical strategies, the lack of adequate knowledge of the subject and missing pertinent foundational content in the EMS curriculum and textbooks. As a result, learners enter the FET phase without being adequately prepared to study accounting in subsequent grades.

TI  - Changing lives: Transformative learning and financial attitudes of Filipino women migrants in Italy
T2  - STUDIES IN THE EDUCATION OF ADULTS-NIACE
AB  - Faced with impoverishment after the financial crisis of 2008, Filipino women migrants in Italy struggle to sustain their financial commitments to their families in the Philippines. Research shows that financial literacy and entrepreneurship (FLE) education can improve financial management and decision-making processes. Spanning a period of eighteen months, this case study aimed at investigating whether the existing training modules organised by Atikha, the Filipino Women Council and the ALSE OF-LIFE Consortium in Italy have led to changes in the financial attitudes of the thirty-three interviewed Filipinas who attended the programs in the last ten years. This paper seeks to highlight the value of FLE training in promoting the transformative interpretation of individual perspectives in line with Mezirow's Transformative Learning process. The training programs can be viewed as empowering interventions, capable of contributing to the development of new personal and financial goals. The interviewees' responses to the in-depth, semi-structured interviews showed that the FLE programs have helped participants critically assess how to develop more productive attitudes towards financial management, and identify sustainable forms of support to their left-behind families.

TI  - Empirical nexus between financial and psychological entrepreneur characteristics and its analogy to entrepreneurship financial performance
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose
   This study aims to examine the key entrepreneurial roles (financial literacy, risk tolerance and competency) in the financial performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Pakistan and the mediating effects of locus of control and spiritual and emotional quotients.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study data was collected from 541 SMEs in Pakistan (the target population) through a survey and analysed with partial least squares structural equation modelling.
   Findings
   The findings revealed that the key entrepreneurial characteristics were positively related to locus of control and spiritual quotient and elevated the financial performance in entrepreneurship. It was also reported that locus of control and spiritual quotient mediated between key entrepreneurial characteristics and financial performance. In this regard, emotional quotient strengthened the existing relationships between key characteristics, locus of control and spiritual quotient.
   Practical implications
   This study highlighted sustainable implications for SMEs to develop an effective mechanism and improve financial performance through guidelines that emphasized entrepreneurial characteristics and behaviours towards positive entrepreneurial ventures. This study also enabled policymakers to design policies that catalysed SME performance in Pakistan.
   Originality/value
   This study contributed a novel concept of key entrepreneurial characteristics by introducing a characteristics tool kit. Consequently, information on a unique framework (by integrating entrepreneurial characteristics and financial performance) and literature on spiritual quotient and locus of control in entrepreneurship were enriched. Contributions to the regulatory focus theory and four-phase Rubicon model in the study context were also made.

TI  - Predicting Stock Market Investment Intention and Behavior among Malaysian Working Adults Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of risk tolerance, financial well-being, financial literacy, overconfidence bias, herding behavior, and social interaction on stock market investment intention and stock market participation among working adults in Malaysia. Adopting the cross-sectional design, this study collected quantitative data from a total of 349 respondents in an online survey via Google form link across various social media platforms. This study used the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach to test the hypotheses. This study revealed the significant positive effects of risk tolerance, herding behavior, and social interaction on stock market investment intention. Stock market investment intention also had a significant effect on stock market participation. Stock market investment intention was also found to successfully mediate the relationships of risk tolerance and overconfidence bias with stock market participation. When it comes to stock market investment, the government and related authorities should focus on developing programs and policies that provide a financial safety net for investors and promote investment-related social platforms. This study linked risk tolerance, financial well-being, financial literacy, overconfidence bias, herding behavior, social interaction, stock market investment intention, and stock market participation. This is one of the few early attempts to address issues in light of the stock market investment participation among the working adults in a developing country.

TI  - Can gamification improve financial behavior? The moderating role of app expertise
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore potential benefits of gamification (application of game-playing elements) for financial well-being and motivation to save.
   Design/methodology/approach - A preliminary survey of college students explored how gamification principles incorporated into money-savings/personal finance smartphone apps could improve financial well-being. The main study utilized Mechanical Turk participants, exposing them to financial game app descriptions that emphasized social features (e.g. leaderboards and ability to share achievements) or economic features (e.g. ability to earn real money or a higher interest rate). Objective and subjective financial measures including expertise with financial apps, perceived benefits of financial apps and behavioral intentions were examined.
   Findings - Financial worry, financial literacy, subjective knowledge and expertise with money-savings/financial applications predicted financial well-being. Additionally, consumers varied in their preferences for certain financial game app features based on past financial app experience. Those who already used a financial app tend to exhibit higher subjective (though not objective) knowledge, and want both "social" and "economic" features of financial applications, whereas those with no experience are more motivated by economic features.
   Practical implications - These results could be used to guide game designers regarding which features may be more attractive to consumers depending on their prior expertise with financial smartphone applications. Financial services marketing would benefit from further research into whether smartphone financial applications that emphasize social features have benefits for consumers' motivation and financial well-being.
   Originality/value - Examining college students about to enter the real world and the general population, this project contributes to research to improve understanding of financial well-being by examining how already having a financial gamification application impacts perceptions of knowledge and expertise, as well as intentions to save given a more socially focused vs economically focused savings app. Additional research needs to further explore gamification as an experimental intervention to ultimately improve both subjective financial well-being and objective financial behaviors, especially for consumers with lower expertise and high risk of financial vulnerability.

TI  - The welfare impact of financial inclusion: a research agenda
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING LITERATURE
AB  - Purpose - This paper provides a systematic review of literature pertaining to the welfare impact of financial inclusion. We identify the 50 most influential publications in the field that have evolved into three distinct categories, each of which we critically review to identify the main contributions of this research area. Design/methodology/approach - By conducting a state-of-the-art literature review, this paper identifies the most influential papers in the research fields on the welfare impact of financial inclusion. One caveat is that as newer publications generally have fewer citations, reviewing prior work can result in a misleading account of emerging trends and research directions. Manual assessment of publications after 2018 facilitates a discussion of important emerging research trends and their directions. Findings - The three key research streams are identified as financial services and financial accessibility, financial capability, and financial literacy and household welfare. By assessing publications from 2018 to 2023, we also document four key emerging research trends: Fintech and digital financial inclusion, sustainability and climate change, growth, poverty, income inequality, financial stability, and Entrepreneurship. Drawing on these emerging trends, we highlight the opportunities for future research. Research limitations/implications - Keyword searches have limitations as some papers might be overlooked if they do not match the specific search criteria, despite their relation and significance to the overall topic of the welfare impact of financial inclusion. To address this issue, we have expanded this review by incorporating more literature from other databases, such as the Scopus database which may alleviate this issue. Practical implications - The three key research streams contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the welfare impact of financial inclusion. The emerging trends integrate existing knowledge and leave the chance for innovative research to expand the research frontier. Originality/value - This paper fulfils the systematic literature review streams in the welfare impact of financial inclusion and provides fruitful opportunities for future research.

TI  - Women empowerment, attitude toward risk-taking and entrepreneurial intention in the hospitality industry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURE TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose First, this study aims to investigate the factors affecting entrepreneurial intentions. Second, it is to identify the influential factors with the highest influence on entrepreneurial intention. Design/methodology/approach The sample of the current study was female employees in various hospitality firms, including restaurants, hotels and wellness services. The questionnaire was developed based on past research studies and was tested for reliability prior to the full set of data collection. To represent the early to mid-level career women in hospitality, female employees with at least one-year experience from hospitality businesses, such as restaurants and hotels, participated in the study and total usable samples were 416. Findings The findings demonstrated that attitude toward risk-taking, self-efficacy, subjective norm and empowerment is significantly influential to the entrepreneurial intention of the women in the hospitality industry. Based on the data analysis, attitude toward risk-taking has the highest influence on entrepreneurial intention. In other words, with a positive attitude toward risk-taking, female employees showed the greatest tendency to start their own business. Research limitations/implications The current study extended the theory of planned behavior in that it can be used to explain the women's entrepreneurial intention with subjective norms, attitudes and self-efficacy. The study also highlighted the flexibility of the theory in allowing the researchers to add external variables to help further investigate the relationships among all the factors in the models. Practical implications To highlight the opportunity to promote more equality and diversity in the business management environments, the results from the study promoted the roles of women entrepreneurs to support hospitality business development. One of the most influential factors is the attitude toward risk-taking. This suggested that with the positive attitude toward risk, the respondents have higher entrepreneurial intentions. Promoting and sharing the success stories of female entrepreneurs can affect the attitude of female employees and raise their interests toward becoming entrepreneurs. Originality/value The current study provided a unique investigation on the early to mid-level career hospitality female employees to explore their intention to be entrepreneurs. This research offered the extension of the theory of planned behavior in the context of entrepreneurship.

TI  - Accounting and finance literacy and entrepreneurship: An exploratory study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate whether the level of financial literacy differs signif-icantly among entrepreneurs in three European countries: Italy, Spain, and the UK. Moreover, I analyze whether financial literacy fosters or hinders entrepreneurial resilience and success. I find that the level of basic financial literacy is significantly lower among entrepreneurs in the UK. I provide an explanation based on job opportunities arguing that basic financial literacy increases the chances of survival of a business, whereas advanced financial literacy decreases it. I propose a taxonomy linking levels of financial literacy with different approaches to financial management. I conclude that a "conservative" approach to financial management (cash based, debt-averse and diversified) is more likely to guar-antee survival even if it is not necessarily the best way to maximize firm value.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Community extension MSME's entrepreneurial activities in relation to poverty reduction
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionHigher Education Institutions play a role in poverty reduction by implementing community extension programs focusing on capacity building and entrepreneurship training. Cebu Technological University programs offer these programs through various skills training to its targeted beneficiaries. This study aims to assess the community extension Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) entrepreneurial activities concerning poverty reduction. The research participants are beneficiaries of community extension programs that primarily focus on capacity building and entrepreneurship training, and they eventually become entrepreneurs. MethodUsing a cross-sectional survey, 172 valid responses were analyzed, with entrepreneurship education (EE), budgeting financial literacy (BFL), access to credit facilities (ACF), and entrepreneurial performance (EP) as predictors of poverty reduction (PR). Results from Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) generate insights from the seven hypothesized paths of the proposed model. Results and discussionFindings revealed that entrepreneurship education (beta = 0.258, p < 0.05), budgeting financial literacy (beta = 0.147, p < 0.05), and access to credit facilities (beta = 0.541, p < 0.001) help reduce poverty. However, no significant relationship was found between entrepreneurial performance and poverty reduction (beta = 0.132, ns) whose cause may be directly pointed to the pandemic's significant impact on MSME's entrepreneurial activities. ConclusionThis study confirms the importance of entrepreneurship education, budgeting, financial literacy, and credit access in promoting entrepreneurial success and reducing poverty.

TI  - Combining teaching methods and developing students' entrepreneurial skills and entrepreneurial intention: The case of students in the Faculty of Economics and Management of Tunis
T2  - INDUSTRY AND HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - This paper analyzes the effects of the combination of two teaching methods on entrepreneurial intention in Tunisia. The developed model suggests that entrepreneurial intention depends on eight cognitive and non-cognitive variables; namely, financial literacy and entrepreneurial knowledge developed through a theoretically-oriented course, and teaching methods, creativity, managing ambiguity, entrepreneurial mindset, entrepreneurial attitude and core self-evaluation developed through a practically-oriented course. The authors use structural equation modeling to test the proposed model, based on a sample of 92 undergraduate management students in the Faculty of Economics and Management of Tunis, Tunisia. The results demonstrate that creativity is a good predictor of students' entrepreneurial intention. Creativity can be developed by entrepreneurial teachers who enhance students' ambiguity management and improve their core self-evaluation. The results also show that financial literacy positively influences entrepreneurial knowledge and managing ambiguity. Entrepreneurial knowledge positively influences entrepreneurial mindset and core self-evaluation. The management students' entrepreneurial mindset positively influences their entrepreneurial attitude, which develops their core self-evaluation. Because the respondents were all studying at the same faculty, the results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to broaden the field of investigation and to include in their studies students from other institutions.

TI  - Social capital, financial intelligence, and entrepreneurial financial performance: evidence from the post-pandemic challenges
T2  - VENTURE CAPITAL
AB  - The convergence of social capital and financial intelligence becomes a dynamic catalyst in the realm of post-pandemic challenges, promoting entrepreneurial financial performance to unforeseen levels as businesses use networks, knowledge, and financial expertise to overcome challenges and grasp new opportunities. Hence, the study explores the factors that influence entrepreneurial financial performance of employees in Pakistan's corporate sector. Using two theoretical frameworks, Regulatory Focus Theory and Rubicon Four-Phase Action Model in Entrepreneurship, study identifies essential traits for entrepreneurship and their direct correlation with financial success. The study utilized a survey questionnaire to gather responses from 276 employees of the corporate sector involved in entrepreneurial activities. The findings suggest that financial literacy, financial risk tolerance, entrepreneurial competency, and social capital positively impact an entrepreneur's locus of control and financial intelligence. Financial literacy equips entrepreneurs with necessary skills and knowledge to manage finances effectively, identify potential financial risks, and increase profitability. Financial risk tolerance enables entrepreneurs to understand financial markets better and make sound financial decisions. Entrepreneurial competency leads to sound financial decision-making and control of financial outcomes. Social capital provides valuable resources, information, and support to improve financial decision-making skills.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC EDUCATION
AB  - This review discusses the heterogeneity in the effectiveness of financial education programs that occurs because of the unique conditions for programs and methods to evaluate them. The authors define six groups served by financial education: children, youth, college students and young adults, working adults, military personnel, and low-incomeconsumers. They then discuss research and evaluation literature for each group with a critical eye on program purpose, content, and evaluation. They also present findings affecting multiple groups on four issues: student loans, homeownership, retirement planning, and financial advising. The accumulated evidence on the effectiveness of financial education is positive, although the results are nuanced and sometimes limited. The authors argue that understanding this broad landscape in studying financial education is critical for future research and evaluation.

TI  - Risk Perception-Perceived Investor Performance Nexus: Evaluating the Mediating Effects of Heuristics and Prospects With Gender as a Moderator
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - As the financial condition of most individuals has taken the toll during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aims to analyze varied risk perceptions owing to dynamic behavioral aspects ingrained in individuals. The study primarily incorporates the impact of COVID-19 induced risk perceptions on psychological bias and its aftermath on perceived investment performance, with gender differences being moderators in the aforesaid relationship. A mix of probability and non-probability sampling has been used to collect data from 1,133 respondents through a structured questionnaire. The partial least square structured equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has been employed as an estimation technique. The findings highlight that risk perception has been significant in affecting the heuristics and prospects. However, it is insignificant in directly impacting the perceived investment performance. However, psychological biases, proxied by heuristics and prospects, were found to mediate the relationship between risk perception and perceived investment performance. Practical implications suggest a judicious combination of risk, return, and behavioral portfolio to stimulate, and upscale investments thereby enhancing the investment momentum to reach pre-covid levels. At the same time, the relevance for society lies in the fact that they need to re-consider their investment portfolio to adjust for uncertainties like COVID-19. Future studies can embark on cross country research to investigate varied risk perception-investment performance relationships prevalent in respective economic settings. Also, studies can explore the variation in findings with respect to different classes of investors that is, experiences, first timers, institutional, influencers and others.
   The purpose of the study is to assess the influence of individuals risk perceptions due to psychological bias on their investment performance. The structured questionnaire was shared with prospective respondents and total of 1,133 responses were received. SEM was used to assess the influence of psychological bias on the relationship of risk perception and investment performance of an individual. The findings highlight that with clear understanding of risk perception, people tend to use few mental shortcuts and focus more on rational decision making and better investment performance. Practitioners/portfolio managers/financial planners can design combinations of risk, return and behavioral portfolio to bring investors back in the market in post covid19 investment scenarios. The researchers can build on the findings of the present study by assessing the longitudinal effect of the heuristics and prospects that influence the investment decision of household investors. In terms of assessment of risk, the studies can be conducted by incorporating various personality traits, cultural influences, family influence, exposure to better investment advice and others such additional variables for having a deeper understanding of differences in the risk perceived by different people.

TI  - Remittances and the financial capabilities of migrant households in the Philippines
T2  - ASIAN AND PACIFIC MIGRATION JOURNAL
AB  - This exploratory mixed methods study sought to determine the financial capabilities of remittance-receiving households from two rural municipalities in the Philippines: San Nicolas in Ilocos Norte province and Moncada in Tarlac province. The broader concept of financial capabilities not only looks at people's financial literacy but also their financial inclusion (access to financial products) and financial functionings (actions on finance). Quantitative household surveys and qualitative data gathering methods that fall under a rapid qualitative inquiry (RQI) design were employed. Results and findings show that more remittance households from San Nicolas saved, invested, and did business in their hometown compared to counterpart migrant household respondents from Moncada. Differences in migrant households' levels of financial literacy, as well as the geographic make-up and economic activities of the two municipalities, may help explain why one municipality had more migrant investors, savers, and entrepreneurs over the other.

TI  - PIRAP: Data Crawling and Internet of Things-Based Opportunity and Challenge Analysis of Migrant Workers' Entrepreneurship Based on Rural Revitalization Environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB  - The main obstacles to migrant workers starting businesses when they return to their hometowns are their own lack of financial literacy and aptitude, a lack of sufficient venture capital, and inadequate financing options. This paper conducts an analysis of the opportunities and challenges under the rural revitalization environment in conjunction with the Internet of Things Technology, through which a migrant labor entrepreneurship analysis platform is built. Data crawling technology is applied to capture internet data resources related to innovative entrepreneurship in the data collection module, and the entrepreneurship data is processed by the Internet of Things Technology. Based on the research, the approach suggested in this paper has its benefits for analyzing the opportunities and difficulties that migrant workers encounter in a rural revitalization context, in order to finally provide some theoretical support for pertinent research.

TI  - Stimulating new business creation through system dynamics education
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose The international community recognizes the role of entrepreneurship education in fostering economic growth and sustainable development. However, preparing the next generation of entrepreneurs is not an easy task, since today's complexity requires the creation of skills and capabilities for which the traditional programs reveal their inadequacy. Some scholars remark how entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intention are not necessarily related and, in line with policy makers' concerns, call for educational programs more routed in financial skills' enhancement. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of system dynamics (SD) for entrepreneurial education, investigating the relationships between financial and entrepreneurial skills' formation and business development. Design/methodology/approach The paper introduces the main elements of SD, describes literature streams of SD applications fitting the entrepreneurial education spheres and proposes an SD' insight model based on selected literature and declined in terms of stock-and-flow and causal loop structures. Findings The study provides a causal model capturing the links between the processes of entrepreneurial skill formation and firms' start-ups and closures. Such model introduces a double effect of financial literacy on entrepreneurial orientation and locates the contribution of simulated entrepreneurial decisions in formal and informal educational contexts. Originality/value The paper displays how SD can contribute to entrepreneurship and presents an original causal model highlighting the accumulation of financial and non-financial skills through education and experience, their impact on business development and the usefulness of SD methodology for skill achievement.

TI  - Income trajectories in later life: Longitudinal evidence from the Health and Retirement Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF AGEING
AB  - We track low-income respondents in the longitudinal Health and Retirement Study for 23 years, to observe how their financial situations unfolded as they aged. We document that (a) real incomes remained relatively stable as individuals entered retirement and progressed through their later years; and (b) labor force participation declined and thus earnings became less important with age, while Social Security and retirement savings rose as a proportion of annual income. Low-income people near retirement also tended to fare poorly during retirement.

TI  - Impact of private and public initiatives on individuals' employment and income during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from Peru
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of private and public initiatives (financial literacy, entrepreneurship, remote work and government aid) on individual job loss and decrease in income during the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru.Design/methodology/approach The authors used an unbalanced panel data analysis with the National Household Survey for 2019-2020. The hypotheses are tested with a probit panel data model since the dependent variables are binary.FindingsThe study findings indicate that financial preparedness reduced the probability of having a decrease in income, but only to informal workers in metropolitan Lima. Furthermore, entrepreneurship helped mainly female informal workers to reduce their probability of becoming unemployed in metropolitan Lima. Besides, the implementation of remote work as a substitute of face-to-face work was not enough to avoid the decrease in income in the case of informal workers and it was only effective to avoid unemployment in the case of formal workers in metropolitan Lima. Finally, public aid proved to be instrumental in mitigating the decrease in income, but only to informal workers in Metropolitan Lima.Research limitations/implications The study results only apply for the first year of the pandemic.Practical implicationsPolicymakers should focus on increasing the financial preparedness of informal workers, especially in provinces.Social implicationsPolicymakers must expand unemployment benefits, and design public aid programs targeting informal workers in provinces.Originality/valueThis is the first study that analyses the impact of private and public initiatives on the decrease in income and unemployment situation of Peruvian individuals during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Ability or opportunity to act: What shapes financial well-being?
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
CP  - Sustainability and Development Conference (SDC)
AB  - This paper draws on nationally representative survey data from 11 emerging and developed economies to measure consumer financial well-being and provide a systematic analysis of its predictors. Whereas the extant literature has been dominated by studies emphasizing the role of individuals' levels of financial literacy and formal financial inclusion, the paper shifts focus towards contextual-level predictors by exploiting subregional variation in structural and institutional features of financial sectors, both within and across countries. It develops a conceptual framework that categorizes such features into 1) those that enhance or inhibit decision-making when selecting or using formal products and 2) those that provide viable substitutes or complements to formal products. It then provides empirical evidence on several examples. Specifically, it highlights the relative importance of having greater prevalence of independent information resources concerning financial products and services, additional provider choice, and some forms of semi-formal and informal finance. The main policy implications are that current efforts to improve broader welfare outcomes through financial literacy and inclusion interventions may still be too narrowly framed. Structural and institutional features related to financial sectors may hinder or enhance financial well-being, even if individuals have adequate financial literacy or be included in formal financial markets. The financial well-being concept may also serve as a useful indicator for monitoring progress towards SDGs 1, 3, 10, and 16. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - What Factors Influence Customer Attitudes and Mindsets towards the Use of Services and Products of Islamic Banks in Bangladesh?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This empirical paper aims at measuring customer attitudes concerning Islamic banking services and how they influence their behavioural intentions to utilise them. Islamic banking has been a fast-growing sector, offering products and services according to Sharia law. Despite being the preferred choice of banking, there is a high percentage of Muslim customers who have shifted from conventional to Islamic banking. Hence, this study aims to examine factors that influence them towards the use of Islamic banking. This is cross-sectional research, where data were collected using questionnaires. A total of 490 questionnaires were received back from adult individuals who were clients of Islamic banks. The data were analyzed using the partial least squares (PLS) method. The findings indicate that ethical organisation, Islamic values, and reputation significantly impact attitudes, whereas financial literacy has no significant impact on them. Attitude is strongly related to the behavioural intention to engage in Islamic banking services. The results also reveal that attitudes mediate the effect of Islamic values, ethical organisation, and reputation on the behavioural intention to engage in Islamic banking services, but Islamic financial literacy is not associated with customers' behavioural mindset to enjoy such services. This study provides an example of initial empirical evidence from a Muslim majority country like Bangladesh on the relationship between Islamic values, ethical organization, Islamic financial literacy, and reputation and attitudes, which in turn lead to customers' behavioural intentions to engage in services and products of Islamic banks.

TI  - How does entrepreneurship influence the efficiency of household portfolios?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - This paper examines the impact of entrepreneurship on the efficiency of household financial portfolios by constructing Sharpe ratios and Sortino ratios of seven kinds of financial assets, based on data from the 2013, 2015 and 2017 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), in conjunction with the returns of the financial asset index of China from 2010 to 2018. Employing CRE regressions, Heckman two-stage models and PSM methods, we find that undertaking entrepreneurship helps to increase the efficiency of household portfolios significantly. This study also verifies that entrepreneurial households improve their portfolio efficiency through financial information by testing the moderating effects of social network, business experience and financial literacy. In addition, this study shows that entrepreneurial households generally adopt a less diversified strategy in asset allocation than do non-entrepreneurial households.

TI  - Investigating the self-employed: the South African perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - PurposeIn a country that is marred by an excessively high unemployment rate, there is a need for policymakers to prioritise entrepreneurship in South Africa. The study aims to explore the determinants of self-employment among the youth in South Africa and in the process answer the following question: Who are the self-employed youths in South Africa? Design/methodology/approachDifferent potential predictors of self-employment empirically used in the literature were used in this study. A probit regression model was used with the binary self-employment variable as the dependent variable and a host of independent variables. A nationally representative survey consisting of youths was used in the analysis. FindingsThe findings show that financial literacy increases the odds of being self-employed. Secondly, the odds of being self-employed increase with age as mature people are expected to have gathered enough networks and wisdom over the years. Thirdly, being male decreases the odds of being self-employed. When it comes to education, the only category that statistically increases the odds of being self-employed compared with no schooling is the tertiary level of education. The other educational levels are all statistically insignificant. From a policy perspective, the government should promote self-employment by investing in financial literacy as well as increasing access to tertiary education among disadvantaged groups. Originality/valueThe study is one of the first, to the best of the authors' knowledge, to examine the characteristics of the self-employed using a nationally representative survey in South Africa.

TI  - When entrepreneurship meets finance and accounting: (non-)financial information exchange between venture capital investors, business angels, incubators, accelerators, and start-ups
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING
AB  - Building on qualitative data from 53 interviews with different types of investors and start-ups, we study the financial and non-financial information that different investor types demand to monitor their portfolio start-ups' performance during different lifecycle stages, as well as how entrepreneurs generate and furnish the required information. We specifically show in detail how investors, like venture capitalists, incubators, or business angels, mitigate agency conflicts through the exchange of specific financial and non-financial information, both formally and informally. By directly comparing both investor and investee cases, we provide insight into the monitoring methods common among different investor types and start-ups. While investors consider accounting to be an important part of the relationship, some entrepreneurs do not or set their priorities differently. Our study illustrates that accounting not only plays a crucial role in the management of established businesses, but is equally important in entrepreneurial investment settings, as is financial literacy.

TI  - Training, human capital, and gender gaps in entrepreneurial performance
T2  - ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB  - In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, policymakers have been increasingly striving to support female entrepreneurship as a possible growth driver. This paper contributes to reconciling mixed findings in the literature on the effectiveness of entrepreneurial training with an analysis that links training and human capital, including tertiary education and non-cognitive skills, with gender gaps in entrepreneurial performance in Africa. We have found that while financial literacy training directly benefits men, it does not raise the sales levels of women entrepreneurs. Instead, tertiary education has a direct positive link with the performance of women. Consistent with our theoretical model where different skills are complements, tertiary education can act as a channel that makes training effective. Regarding non-cognitive skills, evidence shows that women entrepreneurs who are tenacious achieve stronger sales performance. Our results underscore the importance of including tertiary education and entrepreneurial training programs focused on a balanced set of skills, including non-cognitive skills, among policies for women entrepreneurs.

TI  - Deficient regimes of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism: agenda of digital banking and financial inclusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss the dilemma of digital banking and the financial inclusion agenda of countries with the level of strength of the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. Design/methodology/approach This study develops an AML/CFT compliance index using the assessment data of FATF to measure the level compliance strength of countries to measure the impact of the strength of the AML/CFT regime on the financial inclusion. Financial literacy, literacy, number of bank branches and income level of countries are used as other control variables in regression analysis, which is used to test the developed model. Findings The results suggest that the AML/CFT compliance level of a country is a significant factor in determining the level of financial inclusion. Besides, the number of bank branches for 100,000 people, literacy and financial literacy are significant factors in financial inclusion. However, the results reveal that financial literacy is significant over literacy in determining financial inclusion. Therefore, having considered the importance of the AML/CFT regime for financial inclusion, regulators are required to strengthen the AML/CFT regime and make clarity on the AML/CFT regulations. This clarity will promote the digitalization and financial inclusion over time. Practical implications Most of the studies related to financial inclusion and AML/CFT aspects are qualitative. Therefore, this is only the start of measuring the strength of an AML/CFT regime. More appropriate measures will be developed in the future based on this foundation. Originality/value This paper is an original work done by the author, which discusses the issues of digital banking and financial inclusion agenda of countries with the compliance strength of the AML/CFT regime. The AML/CFT compliance index is the original idea of the author, which can be used as a quantitative measure to capture the strength of the AML/CFT regimes in future studies.

TI  - Model intention to success amongst Muslim SME businesses: an exploratory study and future research
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING
AB  - Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia have a significant impact on the economy, contributing 38.3% of GDP in 2022, and so serve as the backbone of the nation. Entrepreneurs' intention to success and their demographic attributes play a crucial role in SMEs' future growth (Delmar and Wiklund, 2008). This paper utilises the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to analyse and propose numerous determinants of attitude (ATT), subjective norms (SN), and perceived behavioural control (PBC) toward success intention among Muslim SMEs. Further, age, education, and gender to model Muslim SMEs' intention to succeed are also analysed. This study contributes to the understanding of entrepreneurs' intention to success and their demographic attributes that may lead to successful SMEs, in particular among Muslim SMEs in Malaysia.

TI  - Unintentional teaching of entrepreneurial competences
T2  - INDUSTRY AND HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Research on entrepreneurship education (EE) emphasizes the role of learning environments, contexts and pedagogical choices in developing students' entrepreneurial competences. EE has assumed that it solely carries the task of improving entrepreneurial competences. Yet, the objectives, content and methods of teaching vary, and hence non-entrepreneurship teachers' classrooms can also provide a learning environment for entrepreneurial competences. However, whether or not this kind of unintentional teaching of entrepreneurial competences takes place has not been widely addressed. In this study, the authors investigate how business school non-entrepreneurship teachers' teaching methods unintentionally match the known framework of entrepreneurial competences. The findings indicate that non-entrepreneurship teachers do unintentionally expose their students to entrepreneurial competences such as creativity, learning from experience and financial literacy. However, competences such as opportunity recognition, perseverance and mobilizing resources do not receive similar attention. The findings indicate that some entrepreneurial competences are not solely owned by EE, but can be embedded in non-entrepreneurship education. Accordingly, the study extends the current understanding of EE and which "niche" competences should be emphasized in it, but also demonstrates how non-entrepreneurship teachers can expose students to entrepreneurial competences while teaching in their own subject areas.

TI  - Gender income gap in rural informal micro-enterprises: an unconditional quantile decomposition approach in the handloom industry
T2  - EURASIAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Based on primary data, the present study analyzes the gender income gap and its compositions throughout the income distribution of the handloom micro-entrepreneurs in Assam. The unconditional quantile decomposition reveals the existence of substantial gender income gaps along the income distribution. The differences in the productive characteristics explain much of the gap at the median and beyond. The endowment effects of education, financial literacy, risk attitude, SHGs membership, and technology adoption are found in favor of the male micro-entrepreneurs. The results suggest that the extent of risk aversion towards producing high-valued dress materials and poor management of entrepreneurial activities of the females have widened gender gap, particularly at the upper quantiles of the income distribution.

TI  - Farmers' adoption of digital technology and agricultural entrepreneurial willingness: Evidence from China
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - Agricultural entrepreneurship significantly improves farmers' livelihoods and it also contributes toward poverty reduction. In the present study, we used the data of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS 2019) as a sample, and empirically examined the dynamic linkages between adoption of digital technology (ADT) and farmers' agricultural entrepreneurial willingness (AEW). The findings of this study reveal that (1) the ADT significantly improved farmers' AEW by 18.5%; (2) the ADT more significantly affected the entrepreneurial willingness of farmers who live in less developed rural areas, or who preference for risk, or whose households have not been affected by major adverse events, or who belong to the rural elite; (3) digital financial participation plays a partial mediating effect of 11.7% in the effect of the ADT on farmers' AEW, with financial literacy and subjective well-being having moderating effects and reinforcing the effect of the ADT on farmers' AEW. Finally, we put forward several policy recommendations, such as narrowing the 'three-level digital divide', improving digital human capital, and developing digital inclusive finance to provide new ideas for farmer entrepreneurship, to enhance farmer's livelihood and to promote rural economic development.

TI  - Entrepreneurial Aspirations and Challenges among Business Students: A Qualitative Study
T2  - ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on small businesses, significantly influencing entrepreneurial aspirations and presenting numerous challenges. This calls for additional research into perceptions, intentions, and the challenges faced in this context. This study aims to explore the comprehension of key entrepreneurial concepts among business students in the post-pandemic era. The paper presents an empirical study which employs qualitative in-depth interviews with 34 undergraduate business students from one public university in the Midwest of the United States. The findings reveal a complex view of entrepreneurship that extends beyond traditional business creation, encompassing elements of social innovation and personal fulfillment. Students displayed a generally positive attitude towards entrepreneurship, influenced strongly by their involvement in practical entrepreneurship-related activities and their familial backgrounds. However, they also identified significant barriers, including financial constraints, fear of failure, and a lack of practical experience, which hinder their intentions to pursue entrepreneurial ventures. The study underscores the importance of entrepreneurship education programs incorporating more comprehensive practical experiences, enhancing financial literacy, and providing psychological support to overcome these challenges. These insights contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to effectively support and prepare aspiring entrepreneurs in a changing educational landscape.

TI  - The Anxious Unwary, Prudent Risk-Averse, and Consciously Confident - Financial Goals, Competencies and Strategies of Young People Studying in Higher Education
T2  - SERVICES MARKETING QUARTERLY
AB  - Our research examines the financial goals, knowledge, self-esteem, attitudes and strategies of young people studying in Hungarian higher education (N = 2557) by classifying youngsters into three groups. Anxious unwary: they are characterized by both living for the day and anxiety, they choose external control strategies, (advantageous marriage, wealthy family). Prudent risk-averse: who are thoughtful, frugal, avoid taking risks. They choose an internal control strategy: budgeting and hard work. Consciously confident: their knowledge and skills are outstanding, their confidence is realistic. They are entrepreneurial and risk-taking choosing long-term, internal control strategies to achieve their financial goals that help them grow their income.

TI  - A Learning-by-Doing Approach to Entrepreneurship Education: Evidence from a Short Intensive Online International Program
T2  - ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Entrepreneurship is considered a key driver for economic growth. Therefore, more and more studies are investigating the role and effectiveness of entrepreneurship education. In this context, the present study is aimed at investigating the effectiveness of entrepreneurship programs, with a learning-by-doing approach, on the entrepreneurial intention, entrepreneurial characteristics (entrepreneurial attitude, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial mindset, core self-evaluation) and entrepreneurial skills (creativity, financial literacy, marshaling of resources, planning, teamwork). The study has analyzed a short intensive online entrepreneurship program, which adopts a learning-by-doing approach and targets students from different European technical universities, with different levels of education and different entrepreneurial backgrounds, giving them the opportunity to work on different types of projects. Pre- and post-course surveys were conducted in order to perform qualitative analyses on the effectiveness of the program. The results show that the entrepreneurial intention and perception of the entrepreneurial characteristics and skills of the students increased after participation in the program. In addition, our findings reveal that the program appears to be more effective for MSc students than for PhD ones and for students who had never attended any entrepreneurship program before, while there is no difference in the effectiveness of the program in terms of gender.

TI  - Promoting Islamic financial ecosystem to improve halal industry performance in Indonesia: a demand and supply analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to identify and explore the role of Islamic financing in supporting development of halal industry in Indonesia.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This research is divided into two studies. The first study uses survey-based quantitative method and the second study uses focus group discussion (FGD) method. Using a purposive and proportional sampling technique in the first study, this research collected 1,985 samples of Islamic financial products of business owners (demand-side) from all parts of Indonesia. The data were analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modeling approach. The authors also conducted FGDs, involving 35 participants from government, financial, social and education institutions (supply-side) as well as business owners (demand-side) in three separated times.
   Findings
   In the first study, it can be identified that literacy on Islamic finance, attitude and awareness strongly affect business owners' intention to use Islamic financial products. It is also found that subjective norm significantly influences literacy, attitude and awareness. Interestingly, religiosity does not significantly affect attitude toward Islamic financial products. According to the FGD in the second study, this research generates several factors motivating business owners' preference to choose conventional rather than Islamic financial products, including expensive pricing, less developed technology, bad service quality and the halal status of the products. The reason for insignificant results of religiosity on attitude in the first study is explained in the second study. Most users are utilitarians who mainly perceived the products based on the sought benefits provided by the products.
   Practical implications
   This research offers the government a road map showing the strategy to build Islamic financial ecosystem in Indonesia. The road map integrates supply-side, which includes government, financial industries, social and education institutions and scientific organizations, and demand-side, which includes business owners or entrepreneur associations.
   Originality/value
   This research provides a wide range of samples derived from business owners' respondents of halal industry in all representative islands in Indonesia. Therefore, it gives more holistic and representative findings. In addition, the analysis in this research covers not only the demand-side but also the supply-side perspective. Lastly, this research provides an Islamic financial ecosystem model that integrates all stakeholders to improve halal industry performance as a whole.

TI  - Innovation, Financial Culture, and the Social-Economic Environment of SMEs in Hungary
T2  - EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES
AB  - Despite the numerous pieces of research that have been undertaken to aid understanding of the innovative activities of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), only a few have dealt with the interaction between innovation activity and the finance-related attitudes, literacy, and knowledge (competencies) of these companies. The current research focuses on specific aspects of the innovation activities of SMEs in a post-communist society (Hungary) by taking into consideration elements of both entrepreneurial financial culture and the social-economic environment. Our analysis is based on a national representative survey, 2017. Results show that the presence of a creative financial culture, and the grounding of management decisions correlate with company innovation. We found that subsidies as external financial sources contribute to a larger extent to the innovation activities of SMEs than other external and internal financial resources. Moreover, the study explores the effects of some economic and social competition-related factors.

TI  - Investigating the factors of SMEs' business resilience in the post-pandemic crisis of COVID-19 with technology adoption as a quasi-moderator: a multigroup analysis of Indonesian and Malaysian SMEs
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - In spite of the devastating effects of COVID-19 on businesses, many SMEs have demonstrated resilience and continued on with their operations. This study investigates the determinants of SMEs' business resilience in Malaysia and Indonesia, with a focus on the moderating factor of technology adoption. The Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, the Dynamic Capability View Theory (DCV), and the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework were combined to analyze a set of business resilience-impacting factors in each country. Online surveys with respondents were used to gather data. Partial least squares-based structural equation modeling was used to examine a total of 539 respondents, of whom 335 were from Indonesia and 204 were from Malaysia. The results showed that government support, technological use, and compliance costs have a significant direct impact on the business resilience of SMEs in both countries. Notably, it was discovered that there were insignificant effects from financial resources and financial literacy. The association between financial resources and business resilience in Indonesia and the relationship between government support and business resilience in Malaysia are both negatively moderated by technology adoption. The findings of this study contributed to a multigroup analysis between neighboring countries, offering valuable insights on the factors influencing SMEs' business resilience to withstand the COVID-19 crisis and their subsequent recovery. It helps explain how SMEs cope with the epidemic, use government support, and use technology to adapt to the changing business climate. These findings enabled SMEs and governments to use preparation and resilience methods to anticipate future difficulties.

TI  - Exploring the impact of digital inclusive finance on consumption volatility: Insights from household entrepreneurship and income volatility
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - The application of digital technology has reshaped all aspects of social life, and the impact of financial technology on the economy is unprecedented. Consumption is an eternal issue in economic development; however, most existing studies have concentrated on how digital inclusive Finance affects household consumption levels, giving little attention to consumption volatility. Nonetheless, policies that overlook consumption volatility are less likely to achieve societal welfare goals, particularly in developing countries. This study aims to fill this gap and unveil the "black box" of the impact of digital inclusive Finance on consumption volatility, which can benefit the development of economic resilience. Utilizing data from the China Household Finance Survey, our research assesses the impact of digital inclusive Finance on household consumption volatility and discovers that digital inclusive Finance significantly smooths out these fluctuations. Mechanism tests further indicate that the main transmission channels for this impact are promoting entrepreneurship and reducing income volatility. Moreover, heterogeneity tests show that the effect of digital inclusive Finance in smoothing household consumption volatility is more pronounced in households with sound financial standing, higher financial literacy, and internet access, especially in rural areas. These findings enrich the literature on digital inclusive Finance's role in managing volatility and extend the theory on the inclusive nature of digital inclusive Finance, offering valuable practical implications for developing countries.

TI  - Are women's entrepreneurial intentions and motivations influenced by financial skills?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENDER AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - Purpose This study aims to determine the contribution of financial skills to entrepreneurial intentions among women involved in university education. Design/methodology/approach Clustering and logistic regression analyses were used to infer the determinants and motivators of entrepreneurial intention in a sample of women students at a Spanish online university. Findings Financial and numerical skills could play a significant role in boosting entrepreneurial culture, overcoming reticence and increasing awareness of business opportunities, particularly when women are motivated to increase their autonomy and income. The study offers meaningful implications for policymakers. Research limitations/implications Further research will be needed before these conclusions may be inferred to other settings and circumstances. Comparison with a similar sample of potential male entrepreneurs may also be necessary to deduce the influence of gender. Practical implications The introduction of certain financial content into the education system by governments and policymakers would produce remarkable results on entrepreneurship intention among women. Social implications Relational capital and positive social influences also contribute to mitigating the effects of risk aversion, one of the main barriers for potential female entrepreneurs. Originality/value The role of financial literacy in entrepreneurial intention among women has scarcely been addressed in academic research. The literature also has paid little attention to the analysis of what motivates women into entrepreneurship, and whether women who decide to embark on a business venture show different profiles. The aim of this study is to contribute to closing these gaps, exploring the effect of cognitive skills, personality traits, contextual factors and motivations.

TI  - Entrepreneurial growth intention and capability approach in agriculture: lesson from Sri Lanka
T2  - SOUTH ASIAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS STUDIES
AB  - Purpose It is imperative to offer a new perspective of Entrepreneurial Growth Intention (EGI) that draws directly upon the capability approach. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of capabilities in the context of EGI in the floriculture industry in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach The study was exploratory and is mainly qualitative in nature. In-depth interviews were carried out with the owners of farms who possess experience in floriculture commercial cultivation in Sri Lanka. Findings The results emerged that there are different perspectives among farm owners regarding EGI. Drawing attention on the stories of our participants and making a three-phase analysis, we identified 31 key actions denoted by the farm owners. This work then suggests that the seven capabilities might be fruitfully framed around EGI. Research limitations/implications As the results stress the role of capabilities in the formation of an entrepreneur's growth intention is vital. Therefore, more targeted measures should be drawn to build fair and supportive facilities to obtain advanced knowledge, to familiarise with the emergence of technology and to attain professional services specifically in financial literacy. Originality/value The question of what factors influence EGI at the farm level is still largely unexplored as less is known about the effect of capabilities on EGI. The study expands the current debates on EGI and institutional environment, which allows the mapping out of capability development.

T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING-REVISTA ESPANOLA DE FINANCIACION Y CONTABILIDAD
AB  - This work aims to analyse the relationship between financial knowledge and the propensity of consumers to complain in the event of disagreement with a financial institution. A sample of 8,286 individuals from the Survey of Financial Competencies elaborated by the Bank of Spain is analysed. The results reveal that individuals with greater financial knowledge show a greater propensity to complain, presumably due to their heightened ability to detect possible fraud or abusive practices by financial entities. Gender itself is not relevant in the propensity to complain. However, when the sample is divided by gender, financial knowledge is more relevant for women than men. Additionally, the results reveal that in the female sample, propensity to complain is affected by self-confidence, in contrast to the male sample. The results suggest that the authorities should take practical steps to include financial knowledge in the educational curriculum.

AB  - A large number of researchers are engaged in studying the determinants and consequences of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Although optimism abounds, in particular, few empirical evidence is available for Pakistani businessmen and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) operators on how to benefit from this tremendous opportunity. Our study examined how top managers/owners of Pakistani energy sector SMEs can innovate their businesses to reap the benefits of CPEC. We have examined the influence of demographic factors (age, education, experience, and financial literacy) of top managers/owners on different forms of innovation (product, process, marketing, and organization) and their consequent chances of success through participation in CPEC.

TI  - Development and validation of an individual entrepreneurial potential new measurement scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - PurposeAs good as existing measurements of entrepreneurial potential (EP) may appear in the literature, they are fragmented, suffer from the lack of theory integration and clarity, are inadequately specified and assessed and the dimensions are unordered by importance. These limitations of EP metrics have hindered entrepreneurial practice and theory advancement. There is a risk of atomistic evolution of the topic among "siloed" scholars and room for repetitions without real progress. The purpose of this paper was to take stock of existing measurements from which the authors developed a new instrument that is brief and inclusive. Design/methodology/approachThe authors followed several steps to develop and validate the new instrument, including construct domain name specification, literature review, structured interviews with entrepreneurs, face validation by experts, semantic validation and statistical validation after two waves of data collected on employee and entrepreneur samples. FindingsA clear operational definition of EP is proposed and serves as a starting point towards a unified EP theory. The new EP instrument is made up of 34 items classified into seven dimensions, which in order of importance are proactive innovativeness, management skill, calculated risk-taking, social skill, financial literacy, entrepreneurial competencies prone to cognitive and heuristic biases and bricolage. The authors provide evidence for reliability and validity of the new instrument. Research limitations/implicationsAlthough a model is not the model, the authors discuss several ways in which the new measurement model can be used by different stakeholders to promote entrepreneurship. Originality/valueThe authors discuss the domain representativeness of the new scale and argue that the literature can meaningfully benefit from a non-fuzzy approach to what makes the EP of an individual. By developing a new EP instrument, the authors set an important pre-condition for advancing entrepreneurial theory and practice.

TI  - Crowd-funding to promote women entrepreneurship: a systematic literature review of the empirical studies conducted in the last decade (2012-2023)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENDER AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - Purpose - It aims to understand crowdfunding's effect on women's entrepreneurship and summarize key findings, methods, and challenges women face in using crowdfunding for financing. Design/methodology/approach - This literature review examines 36 empirical studies on crowdfunding use by women entrepreneurs. It follows the PRISMA framework, using Scopus and citation tracking to categorize studies on crowdfunding's potential to empower women financially and address their barriers to accessing finance. Findings - The review identified seven key themes: opportunities and challenges for women in crowdfunding, equity crowdfunding's potential, gender differences in crowdfunding outcomes, the role of social capital and networks, investor trust and decision-making, the influence of language, communication, and platform design, and the importance of considering intersectionality and context. Crowdfunding offers women entrepreneurs access to capital and helps them overcome traditional financing barriers. Women-led campaigns achieve comparable or even higher success rates compared to their male counterparts. However, under-representation, lower funding requests, pitching difficulties, and limited access to networks remain as challenges. Research limitations/implications - This study has limitations inherent to systematic reviews, including potential methodological flaws or biases in the included studies and the exclusion of relevant studies due to time and resource constraints. Practical implications - Crowdfunding can be promoted as a viable financing option for women entrepreneurs and design targeted initiatives to support them. Building social capital, enhancing financial literacy, and creating networking opportunities can contribute to their success in navigating crowdfunding platforms effectively. Originality/value - This review offers a comprehensive analysis of empirical studies conducted between 2012 and 2023. It provides up-to-date insights, identifies key themes, and offers actionable recommendations for policymakers and organizations seeking to support women entrepreneurs in effectively accessing and utilizing crowdfunding platforms.

TI  - The differences in the impact of entrepreneurial abilities of various European SMEs on their financial risk perceptions
T2  - ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS REVIEW
AB  - Objective: The objective of the article is to investigate whether the impact of innovativeness and competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on their financial risks differ depending on the countries where SMEs are located.
   Research Design & Methods: The researchers created an online questionnaire and gained data from 1221 Czech, Slovak, and Hungarian SMEs. Moreover, the researchers applied ordinal logistic regression analyses to achieve the goal of this study.
   Findings: According to the results, the impact of competitiveness on the bankruptcy risk perception of SMEs differ depending on the countries where they operate. Concerning the impact of innovativeness on financial performance and financial risk management, this article also proves that international differences between SMEs exist.
   Implications & Recommendations: The developments in the financial literacy of company executives and their managerial experiences and the improvements in credit access conditions, intellectual property rights, and tax legislation can make SMEs reduce their concerns about their financial risks. Thus, policymakers' implementations are crucial to providing equal opportunities for SMEs even if they operate in various markets.
   Contribution & Value Added: This current research does not only make international comparisons among the investigated variables but also analyses the impacts of entrepreneurial competencies on various indicators of financial risk. These facts not only make this research become a unique study in the literature but also the reason why it should garner the interest of prospective readers such as policymakers, academicians, and SME owners.

TI  - Impact of Institutional Quality and Governance on Financial Inclusion for Women in South Africa: A Case of Gauteng Women Entrepreneurs
T2  - STRATEGIC REVIEW FOR SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB  - This paper describes a study of South Africans' national perception and alignment to financial inclusion for women. It explains the impact of institutional roles and governance on financial inclusion in South Africa. There is ample evidence of government efforts on implementing financial inclusion in the country. Still, the significance of how governance and institutions promote access to finance for women has been overlooked in the literature. The main objective of this study is to identify the impact of institutional quality and governance on financial inclusion for women in South Africa. Data for analytical purposes supporting the research has been obtained from primary sources through semi-structured open-ended interviews collected from 2019 to 2020. The research approach employed and coded data from a recent study on 30 women entrepreneurs, five key policymakers on women empowerment and five financial institutions supervisors on financial inclusion for women. The results obtained suggest that there is little institutional quality and governance on financial inclusion for women, and further efforts must be intensified to achieve equal access to financial services in South Africa. Furthermore, the paper presents recommendations for policymakers that, if implemented, would prove fruitful. Policymakers are expected to facilitate gender-mainstreaming/strategies and working policies, monitoring and evaluation, financial literacy, and transparent legal framework on financial policies addressing women.

TI  - Navigating the digital financial landscape: unraveling the impact of financial behavior traits on women-owned enterprises in the new normal perspective
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Exploring the financial behavior traits amidst the unexpected financial challenges and the unparalleled rise in fintech, this study provides insight into the interplay of entrepreneur digital financial literacy (EDFL), entrepreneur financial competency (EFC), and entrepreneur financial skill (EFS) impacting entrepreneur financial decision-making (EFDM). Toward this goal, data were gathered from 223 active women entrepreneurs from India who have accounts in the social media platform. The three-step hierarchical regression analysis disclosed that an entrepreneur with sound EDFL, EFS, and EFC can significantly enhance strategic decision-making (EFDM). The research outcome reveals that EFDM is a consistent predictor of the financial performance of women-owned enterprises. In addition, the entrepreneur's financial decision-making does not mediate the relationship between financial experience, financial competency, financial skill budgeting, and financial skill_acumen with financial performance. In contrast, partial mediation is observed between digital financial awareness, digital financial knowledge, and financial skill_analytics. The novel insight accounted for a significantly low level of experience in entrepreneurs' utilization of digital platforms for payment, financing loans, and asset management. The outcome carries academic, regulatory, and managerial significance, recognizing the unique interaction; the cumulative efforts strengthen the capacity to address socio-economic challenges and translate them into gender-specific policy interventions and practices.

TI  - Digital technology access, labor market behavior, and income inequality in rural China
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - This study uses China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data from 2010 to 2018 to empirically investigate the interplay between digital technology access, labor market behavior, and income inequality in rural China. The following salient conclusions are derived. Digital technology access has a substantial negative influence on individual income inequality in rural China, with a more pronounced inhibitory effect on inequality among low-income groups, males, middle and higher professional classes, and younger cohorts. Mechanism analysis suggests that digital technology access significantly impacts a range of rural labor practices, including increasing the frequency of digital technology use among rural inhabitants, decreasing credit costs, enhancing entrepreneurial activities, and boosting rural labor mobility. Based on these findings, this study proposes accelerating digital infrastructure development in rural regions, improving digital and financial literacy among rural residents, and refining inclusive digital financial services to facilitate more stable and sustainable progress to promote common prosperity.

TI  - Financializing the soul: Christian microfinance and economic missionization in Colombia
T2  - CRITICAL RESEARCH ON RELIGION
AB  - Microfinance is the vanguard of financialization today. This is especially true in Colombia, where microfinance rivals any other type of formal credit. Entangled with Colombia's micro-financialization is the phenomenon of microfinance corporations in joint ventures with Christian organizations that broker their microfinance programs. These faith-based corporations temper the surge in microfinance with ascetic discipline and the infusion of an entrepreneurial spirit. Economic discipline, say the microfinanciers, is required for what is referred to as 'financial literacy' and 'financial inclusion' programs that instil a distinctly Christian corporate order. This article, based on 2 years of sustained fieldwork in Colombia, focuses on one such microfinance program run by a transnational Christian credit organization. With microfinance, souls are disciplined through debts and ideals of an ascetic prosperity. In the end, the article concludes that there is a Christian morality to financialized capitalism that is exercised at the level of the interior soul.

TI  - The employment environment for youth in rural South Africa: A mixed-methods study
T2  - DEVELOPMENT SOUTHERN AFRICA
AB  - South Africa has high youth unemployment. This article examines the predictors of youth employment in rural Agincourt, Mpumalanga Province. A survey of 187 out-of-school 18 to 24 year olds found that only 12% of women and 38% of men were currently employed. Men with skills/training were significantly more likely to report employment, mostly physical labour (adjusted odds ratio: 4.5; confidence interval: 1.3, 15.3). In-depth interviews with 14 of the youth revealed that women are perceived more suitable for formal employment, which is scarce, informing why women were more likely to pursue further education and yet less likely to be employed. Ten key informants from local organisations highlighted numerous local youth employment resources while, in contrast, all youth in the sample said no resources were available, highlighting a need for the organisations to extend their services into rural areas. Because these services are focused on entrepreneurship, programmes to increase financial literacy and formal employment opportunities are also needed.

TI  - The Effect of Digital Financial Inclusion on Relative Poverty Among Urban Households: A Case Study on China
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - This study examines the effect of digital financial inclusion on relative poverty among urban households in China. Based on the data of the China Family Panel Studies and the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China, using the weak relative poverty line to identify relative poverty among urban households, we use a probit model, a mediating effect model, and an instrumental variable method to conduct empirical research. The results reveal that digital financial inclusion helps reduce the probability that urban households will fall into relative poverty. Digital financial inclusion not only promotes entrepreneurship by urban households but also increases their participation in the financial market. The increase in their income flow can be translated into an improvement in the stock of wealth, enabling them to avoid falling into relative poverty. But this effect is heterogeneous. Digital investment and digital credit play more important roles than digital payment. It is also more pronounced in households with higher financial literacy and households in smaller cities. In addition, regardless of how the relative poverty line and digital financial inclusion are calculated, our results are robust. The research in this study is important for a comprehensive understanding of the development of digital financial inclusion and urban relative poverty in developing countries such as China.

TI  - Propensity toward Islamic debt financing among Moroccan MSMEs: assessing the mediating effect of entrepreneurial achievement motivation using PLS-MGA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThis study investigates the factors influencing the intention to use Islamic Debt Financing (IDF) among owners-managers of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Morocco.Design/methodology/approachWe developed and validated a comprehensive model that examines the key behavioral elements affecting attitude towards IDF, entrepreneurial achievement motivation, and IDF usage intention. Entrepreneurial achievement motivation was assessed as a mediator in the relationship between attitude towards IDF and usage intention. Gender and Islamic religiosity were examined as moderators through Multi-Group analysis. Utilizing data from 266 Moroccan MSMEs, we applied structural equation modeling for empirical evaluation.FindingsResults revealed direct relationships with financial literacy, risk perception, and cost perception negatively affecting attitude toward IDF. Financial suitability is inversely related to attitude toward IDF. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy and subjective norms positively influenced entrepreneurial achievement motivation. Attitude toward IDF positively impacted entrepreneurial achievement motivation, and both attitude toward IDF and entrepreneurial achievement motivation were linked to the intention to use IDF. Empirical findings indicated that entrepreneurial achievement motivation partially mediates the relationship between attitude towards IDF and usage intention. Multi-group analysis revealed a significant moderating effect of Islamic religiosity on three out of nine structural relationships.Research limitations/implicationsThis study is primarily limited by the absence of a longitudinal examination tracking real usage behavior. Moreover, data collection focused on analyzing the behavioral intention to use Islamic debt-based financing products, excluding equity-based financing instruments. Finally, our proposed model concentrates on establishing usage intention solely based on demand-side factors without explicitly integrating supply-side consideration.Practical implicationsOur findings contribute to a deeper understanding of IDF adoption behavior and have the potential to support the development of more effective public policies, targeted promotional campaigns, and impactful financial education programs for MSMEs in similar markets.Originality/valueThis paper represents the first attempt to address MSMEs' apprehensions regarding Islamic debt-based financing products in the MENA region.

TI  - Equity illusions
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAW ECONOMICS & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Although equity-compensation grants for rank-and-file employees are common in startups and are considered an ingrained part of their business culture, little is known about how employees approach this form of compensation. We begin filling this gap by examining employees' financial literacy regarding equity compensation and their willingness to forgo cash compensation for startup equity. Using a survey and a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques with conventional regression modeling, we find that employees commonly respond to economically irrelevant signals and misinterpret other important signals. The findings suggest that employees harbor a range of "market illusions" regarding startup equity that can lead to inefficiencies in the labor market, which sophisticated employers can legally exploit. The results raise questions about the protection of employees in their investor capacity in a market where highly sophisticated repeat players, such as venture capital investors, interact with unorganized and uninformed retail investors.

TI  - ECONOMIC, DIGITAL, OR ENTREPRENEURIAL LITERACY: WHICH MATTERS FOR DRIVING STUDENTS' ECONOMIC BEHAVIOUR?
T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction. It remains a challenge for educational sides to confront the advancement of technology that has both challenges and opportunities in various sectors of human life. Since the matter of this theme, the studies on the impact of digital literacy and economic behaviour are insufficient. The lack of a broader understanding of the involvement of digital literacy in the economic and management literature with economic behaviour of students has motivated to perform a systematic literature review to identify and synthesise essential gaps in the literature. Despite there being several reviews in economic behaviour, it is not connected specifically to entrepreneurial literacy, and digital literacy. Most studies are taking a stance on investigating consumption behaviour or financial behaviour, as well as involving financial literacy as the major.
   Aim. This study aims to identify the interconnectedness between economic, entrepreneurial, and digital literacy and economic behaviour of students.
   Methodology and research methods. This study employed a systematic literature review of papers published in Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and ProQuest databases using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The use of PRISMA is beneficial in providing more detail results and diminishing any possibility biases.
   Results and scientific novelty. The results of the study indicate that economic, digital, and entrepreneurial literacy can have impact to economic behaviour of students. The findings show an increasing economic behaviour trend in recent years in Indonesia and some countries. Thus, the study also noted that economic and digital literacy had been confirmed as essential to predict economic behaviour in terms of consumptive and productive activities. Meanwhile, the role of entrepreneurial literacy is paid less attention among scholars in explaining economic behaviour of students. This result will offer to future scholar in this theme to investigate these variables using certain method and approach.
   Practical significance. The results of this study provide a practical suggestion for scholars in the field of economics and entrepreneurship to consider the variables listed in this study. In addition, the study review synthesises several gaps research in the education, economics, and management literature that present a basis for providing future research related to economic behaviour.

TI  - THE IMPORTANCE OF METACOGNITIVE STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING COMPETITIVE BUSINESS COMPETENCIES
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPETITIVENESS
AB  - The aim of this study is to verify and evaluate experimentally the effect of using activating methods and the related application of metacognitive learning strategies in case studies. The research sample consisted of 220 students, 16-17 years old. The experiment was chosen as the basic research method. The authors' research focuses first on building a case study. This was subsequently verified experimentally in the second research phase, and its effect on the development of higher cognitive dimensions was evaluated. Relevant research tools were developed, including a case study adapted to each age group of students with a focus on relevant educational content and two non-standardized professional tests in the form of a post-test that was uniformly designed for the experimental and control group to determine the range of effects at the level of development of lower and higher-order thinking processes that the implemented methods can produce. The tests took into account the age of students, content and cognitive difficulty. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney u-test was chosen to verify null hypotheses at 5% significance. The results indicate that the application of metacognitive learning strategies at an adequate age and adequate level of cognitive abilities of students are the assumption of financial literacy and entrepreneurship support. Using activating teaching methods through the implementation of the case study method is more successful and effective in the development of higher-order thinking operations than the established traditional methods, which are still nowadays overused by teachers. This means that methods have a significant impact on the development of higher cognitive dimensions, which are the fundamental assumption of a successful career for economists and corporate managers. The development of these competencies strengthens the competitiveness of this profession in the labour market.

TI  - Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) during the post-pandemic economic recovery period: digitalization, literation, innovation, and its impact on financial performance
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study explores the impact of digitalization, literation, and innovation on the financial performance of Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) in Bojonegoro, East Java, Indonesia. Using a sample of 35 business owners, the research employs partial least squares structural equations modelling. The findings reveal a positive and significant relationship between innovation and MSMEs' financial performance, emphasizing the crucial role of innovative practices. Additionally, business owners' literacy levels positively influence innovation. Although digitalization shows a positive impact on innovation and financial performance, the lack of statistical significance calls for nuanced exploration. The study contributes to understanding the complex dynamics within MSMEs post-pandemic, emphasizing the importance of literation and innovation. The research offers practical insights for MSME owners on enhancing financial literacy and fostering an innovative culture within their businesses. Policymakers were also encouraged to allocate resources to facilitate financial training for business owners. Urban areas might employ varying pandemic response strategies depending on their economic circumstances, resulting in differences in interaction variables. Future studies should extend these findings to diverse urban settings to broaden our understanding of literation, innovation, and digitalization's impact on MSME performance.

TI  - FinTech and sustainable development: A systematic thematic analysis using human- and machine-generated processing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) by integrating FinTech with the the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By focusing on three dimensions (inclusive finance, economy, and environment), we identify how FinTech may influence sustainable development. We innovate using human- and machine-generated processing to develop themes, making systematic literature reviews more objective and advancing replicability and reproducibility. This study demonstrates the contribution of FinTech in expanding the investment opportunity set by including environmental projects and increasing the diversity and participation rates of savers and lenders. Through this process, FinTech increases its market completeness. Accordingly, FinTech can increase economic growth by achieving higher productivity and sustainable growth through diversification, technological upgrades, entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation. Additionally, FinTech can accelerate investments in poverty eradication and reduce income inequality. These contributions are aligned with specific SDGs and show that FinTech is an appropriate new technology for financial services.

TI  - GRADUATE EMPLOYABILITY SKILLS: THE VOICE OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING (ATVET) STUDENTS IN ZIMBABWE
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - The graduate employability has seen most governments, institutions of higher learning and industries engaging each other, as industries feel universities and colleges are churning out graduates that are not work ready. This has led to many strands to the discourse of graduate employability. One strand of the discourse is whether the higher education institutions should produce work-ready graduates. Another strand of the discourse is on how these institutions can make their graduates work ready, if it is an expectation that the graduates should be work ready. There is also another strand of the discourse on what constitutes graduate employability, that is, what skills make graduates work ready. This article looks at the latter from the perspectives of Agricultural Technical and Vocational Education and Training (ATVET) students in Zimbabwe. The article reports on part of a major study that was conducted on student internship and employability. Data was collected through focus group discussions with final year students from three agricultural colleges, that were selected using an eclectic sampling strategy which incorporated both typical case and maximal variation. The study showed that students view soft skills, namely entrepreneurship, financial literacy, innovativeness, ethics, problem-solving, honesty and some technical skills as essential to them.

TI  - Unlocking Financial Inclusion Through ICT and Mobile Banking: A Knowledge-Based Analysis of Microfinance Institutions in Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB  - Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are critical in providing financial services to low-income individuals in developing countries, but challenges such as inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and low financial literacy have affected effective service delivery. In Ghana, MFIs have adopted information and communication technology (ICT) and mobile banking/money solutions to address these challenges. This study uses qualitative and quantitative research methods to explore the impact of integrating ICT and mobile banking/money adoption on the efficiency, growth, and outreach of MFIs in Ghana. The findings reveal that the integration of ICT and mobile banking/money adoption positively impacts the efficiency, growth, and outreach of MFIs, loan repayment rates, and financial inclusion. However, effective utilization and adoption of these technologies face barriers such as limited ICT infrastructure, a lack of technical expertise, and insufficient awareness of the benefits of these technologies. Furthermore, the study shows that integrating ICT solutions into microfinance operations has a significant positive relationship with MFIs' growth and customer satisfaction rates. The study contributes to the literature on the adoption of ICT solutions in microfinance operations and provides insights into how MFIs can integrate ICT solutions into their operations to enhance their performance.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore how banks in Nigeria are marketing financial services to financially vulnerable customers. Design/methodology/approach A multiple case study research strategy was used to analyse three commercial banks and two microfinance banks. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with the banks' directors as well as from banks' published annual reports and archival images. Findings The study reveals that Nigerian banks develop different product development portfolios, adopt innovative traditional marketing schemes and apply inclusive technologies to reach and extend services to the unbanked and financially vulnerable customers in the society. Research limitations/implications Banks should focus on consumer engagement through the proactive development of technologies and employ innovative marketing methods. Customers' banking experiences can be enhanced if banks communicate with and educate customers about technological modes of engagement. In addition, financial service transaction support and financial literacy education can assist banks in marketing their services to financially vulnerable customers, in mutually beneficial ways. Originality/value This study shows how financial service operators' market and extend their services to financially vulnerable customers in emerging markets. It empirically establishes the importance of financial services to financially excluded customers.

TI  - Are Credit-Based Internet Consumer Finance Platforms Sustainable? A Study on Continuous Use Intention of Chinese Users
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Internet consumer finance platforms (ICFPs), as a new Internet financial model, have emerged and been widely adopted by Chinese as well as global online shoppers following the rapid growth of e-commerce. This emerging financial tool is, however, luring younger generations deep into debt. It jeopardizes the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1-No poverty, bringing the sustainability of this consumer financial model into question. To aid the sustainable development of ICFP industry, this paper distinguishes two antecedents of continuous use intention for ICFP users: (1) satisfaction, as a sustainable determinant; and (2) impulsive buying, as a non-sustainable determinant. We found satisfaction (b = 0.452) has a larger positive effect on continuous use intention compared to impulsive buying (b = 0.229). Therefore, ICFPs should weigh heavier on technology innovation instead of seducing consumers' impulsive buying behavior. We also found that credit limit misconception poses the largest impact (b = 0.483) on impulsive buying. In the near term, governments and ICFPs may initiate public programs to improve ICFP users' financial literacy in order to restrain their unsustainable impulsive buying behavior and cultivate their sustainable satisfaction on ICFP technology and service. Market regulators may build up institutional frameworks to tighten the abuse of financial platforms on credit issuing power and better foster sustainable entrepreneurship in this new financial platform business.

TI  - Critical Success Factors for Enhancing the Community Economic Well-being
T2  - SOCIAL WELFARE INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH
AB  - Well-being is not only defined objectively but also subjectively that refers to the study of happiness and life satisfaction. This study aims to analyze measurement indicators and factors that influence economic well-being based on previous studies discussing economic well-being and the factors that influence it. To provide a systematic review of the literature, we adopted a Prisma-based flowchart model to achieve a deeper understanding. The findings show that the main indicator that is often used in measuring economic well-being is income, followed by wealth, consumption expenditure, employment status, productivity, financial stability, inequality, and education level. This result also confirms that literacy levels such as entrepreneurial literacy, health literacy, food literacy, and financial literacy are factors that affect economic well-being. In addition, life satisfaction with work and education, economic behavior both in consumption and production as well as work-life balance in the division of time for work and other personal matters also affect the level of individual and community economic well-being. From the results of the study obtained, it can contribute to the government as a policy maker to pay attention to the well-being of the community. In addition, it provides another description of the factors that influence economic well-being for further research, like home economic literacy.

TI  - Exploring the Attitudes and Practices Regarding Alternative Revenue Streams among Indian Dental Professionals - A cross-sectional analysis
T2  - BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Background This study aimed to explore the attitudes and practices of dental professionals regarding alternative sources of revenue through a descriptive cross-sectional design and to explore other demographic factors which influence them. Materials and Methods A Descriptive Cross -Sectional study was conducted among 400 dental professionals selected using stratified random sampling and were approached either personally or through electronic medium to fill a pretested validated questionnaire assessing their attitudes and practices towards alternative sources of revenue. The data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 26.0. Cross tabulations were made and statistical significance was assessed using Pearson's Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. A Binary Logistic Regression model was developed to predict the practice of alternative sources of revenue based on gender, qualification, occupation, and experience. Results The results showed that about 36% of the participants are currently pursuing alternative sources of income with a significantly higher percentage of females involved (p=0.005). Most of the participants (37.6%) reported investing in stocks and finance followed by real estate, food industry, career guidance, product development etc. Around twothirds of females reported being unsatisfied with their current income from dentistry and they have 1.76 times the odds of pursuing alternative sources compared to males (p=0.022). Undergraduate dentists have 2.51 times the odds of practising other means of revenue. Conclusions The study concludes that a substantial percentage of respondents had pursued alternative sources of revenue. Policymakers and educators can use these findings to develop strategies to promote entrepreneurship and financial literacy among dental professionals.

TI  - Influence of Digital Finance on Household Leverage Ratio from the Perspective of Consumption Effect and Income Effect
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Household leverage ratio is an important factor affecting family stability. Digital finance has changed the means of payment and consumption frequency, but the relationship between digital finance and household leverage ratio is still unclear. The existence of household debt is defined as the existence of leverage. The higher the household debt, the greater the household leverage. Based on the matching data of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) 2019 and the China Digital Inclusive Finance Index, this paper studies the impact of digital finance on household leverage ratio and explores its mechanism theoretically and empirically. This research finds that digital finance can significantly promote the household leverage ratio and this conclusion is still valid after instrumental variable method and robustness test. The mechanism analysis shows that digital finance can promote household over-consumption and further expand household leverage ratio. Digital finance can also reduce household leverage ratio by increasing household income. The heterogeneity analysis suggests that the role of digital finance in expanding leverage ratio is stronger for urban areas and households with low educational level. For households with higher assets, digital finance helps to reduce leverage ratio. Therefore, the government should guide residents to consume rationally and give full play to the entrepreneurship-facilitating and income-increasing effect of digital finance. Meanwhile, the residents themselves should speed up the cultivation of digital financial literacy, which is of vital significance for lowering household leverage ratio and systemic financial risks. China's development level of digital finance ranks among the top in the world. Studying the role of digital finance in China is helpful to provide experience reference for countries around the world.

TI  - Bridging the Digital Divide: Unraveling the Determinants of FinTech Adoption in Rural Communities
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - Bridging the digital divide between urban and rural communities is critical for expanding financial inclusion. The purpose of this study is to understand the key factors driving the adoption of financial technology (FinTech) applications among rural residents. A conceptual framework is built on the basis of the technology acceptance model, along with the incorporation of innovation awareness and financial awareness. The relationships between factors are empirically validated using a structural equation modeling approach based on survey data from a sample of 386 respondents in rural communities. The results indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, innovation awareness, and financial awareness can positively and significantly affect the intention to adopt FinTech applications. In addition, perceived usefulness mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention. Practical implications for promoting FinTech adoption in rural areas are discussed.
   We investigate the key factors driving the adoption of financial technology (FinTech) applications among rural residents. The findings reveal that: (1) The extended TAM model is suitable for studying FinTech adoption in a rural context. (2) Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, innovation awareness, and financial awareness positively and significantly affect the intention to adopt FinTech applications. (3) Perceived usefulness mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention. We suggest that policymakers can offer education and training programs to improve financial literacy and financial awareness, promoting the use of FinTech products. FinTech products should be simple to use and navigate for rural residents who might not be as tech-savvy. It is important to foster a culture of innovation in rural areas by providing incentives for entrepreneurship and innovation.

TI  - Do bank credit rejection and financial education affect financial self-confidence?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR & RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the determinants of owner manager financial self-confidence. In particular, it estimates the effect of bank credit rejection and financial education (FE) on the financial self-confidence of business owners.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses data from 2004 and 2008 surveys of 2,500 UK small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). An ordered probit estimation is used to measure and assess the effect of bank credit rejection and FE variables on financial self-confidence for the two periods. The authors also explore potential differences in self-confidence between males and females.
   Findings - The results show that outright bank credit rejection reduces financial self-confidence among owner managers whereas partial bank credit rejection is found to help boost confidence prior to the financial crisis. There is strong evidence that FE increases financial self-confidence. Finally, the authors find no association between gender and reported self-confidence in finance.
   Research limitations/implications - Entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs are encouraged to explore financial literacy and knowledge with a view to increasing their financial self-confidence. This will help SMEs to deal with the banks or other finance providers more efficiently. In addition, better application procedures and information on lending criteria may help SMEs to minimize the probability of bank credit rejection. So the current study has implications for professional bodies as well. The study, however, is restricted to sole proprietor and partnership SMEs and in the UK context only.
   Practical implications - Financial self-confidence has a progressive effect on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial venture growth. The financial self-confidence of owner managers can support their entrepreneurial capability in starting and operating one or more businesses. As entrepreneurs successfully start and operate their own businesses, they are contributing to economic development through job creation, employment and tax contribution.
   Originality/value - This paper makes an original contribution in highlighting the usefulness of FE in boosting financial self-confidence among entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs. It is also found that the experience of bank credit rejection reduces entrepreneurs' financial self-confidence.

TI  - Project Inspire pilot study: A hospital-led comprehensive intervention reduces gun violence among juveniles delinquent of gun crimes
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gun violence disproportionately affects young Black men, but the impact extends to families and communities. Those at highest risk are teens delinquent of gun crimes. While there is no nationally accepted juvenile rate of recidivism, previous literature reveals rearrest rates from50% to 80% in high-risk youth, and some reports showthat up to 40% of delinquent juveniles are incarcerated in adult prisons before the age of 25 years. We hypothesize that Project Inspire, a hospital-led comprehensive intervention, reduces recidivism among high-risk teens.
   METHODS: Led by a level 1 trauma center, key community stakeholders including the juvenile court, city, and city police department joined forces to create a community-wide program aimed at curbing gun violence in high-risk individuals. Participants, aged 13 to 18 years, are selected by the juvenile gun court. They underwent a rigorous 3-week program with a curriculum incorporating the following: trauma-informed training and confidence building, educational/professional development, financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and career-specific job shadowing and mentorship. Rates of recidivism were measured annually.
   RESULTS: Project Inspire has hosted two classes in 2018 and 2019, graduating nine participants aged 14 to 17 years. Sixty-seven percentwere Black. Allweremales. At 1 year, none of the graduates reoffended. At 2 years, one participant reoffended. At 3 years, no additional participants reoffended. No graduate reoffended as a juvenile. Thus, the overall rate of recidivism for Project Inspire is 11% to date. Eighty-nine percent of graduates received a diploma, general educational development, or obtained employment.
   CONCLUSION: Project Inspire is a hospital-led initiative that effectively reduces recidivismamong juveniles delinquent of gun crimes. This sets the framework for trauma centers nationwide to lead in establishing impactful, comprehensive, gun-violence intervention strategies.

TI  - Pushing the entrepreneurial prodigy: Canadian Aboriginal entrepreneurship education initiatives
T2  - CRITICAL STUDIES IN EDUCATION
AB  - Globally, neoliberal education policy touts youth entrepreneurship education as a solution for staggering youth unemployment, a means to bolster economically depressed regions, and solution to the ill-defined changing marketplace. Many jurisdictions have emphasized a need for K-12 entrepreneurial education for the general population, and targeted to youth labeled at risk'. The Martin Aboriginal Education Initiative's Aboriginal Youth Entrepreneurship Program (AYEP) has been enacted across Canada. This paper applies critical discourse analysis to a corpus of texts, exposing how colonial practices, deficit discourse, and discursive neoliberalism are embedded and perpetuated though entrepreneurial education targeted at Aboriginal students via AYEP.

TI  - Impact of an integrated youth skill training program on youth livelihoods: A case study of cocoa belt region in Ghana
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This paper assesses the impact of an integrated skills training program given to youth aged 17-25-year old living under the $2/day poverty line in the cocoa belt region of Ghana. Despite being a leading producer of cocoa and having a burgeoning youth population, it is estimated that the average age of a cocoa farmer in Ghana is greater than 50 years. To introduce young people to cocoa farming and address the potential barriers they face in order to do that; a multi-faceted skills training programme was designed with the ultimate aim of improving and diversifying youth livelihoods. The training had three key components: i) cocoa academies (which includes agricultural practices; life skills and financial literacy); ii) business incubators (including entrepreneurial training, networks, mentoring) and iii) supporting enabling environment (access to land and finance). Combining quasi-experimental methods Propensity Score Matching with Difference in Differences, we estimate the causal effect of the programme on agricultural outcomes (farming, agricultural practices), financial behaviour outcomes (saving practices, mobile banking) and livelihood outcomes (employment, income, poverty likelihood) one year after the completion of training. The results of the impact evaluation suggest that compared to the control group (youth nonparticipants), youths who participated in the training adopt better agricultural practices (26 percentage points (pp)), cultivate cocoa (24 pp), and are more likely to engage in farming (22 pp). We also find a 28.7% increase in income in the last seven days and hours worked by 12.4%. Youth also increase the use of banks for saving (16 pp), save using mobile money (6.7 pp), the use of Village Savings and Loan Associations (1.7 pp) and, in general, the use of mobile money for both sending and receiving transfers (10.6 pp). The sex-disaggregated sub-sample analysis provides other valuable insights on the intervention.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Can entrepreneurship bring happiness? Evidence from China
T2  - ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between entrepreneurial activities and the happiness of entrepreneurs. We estimate the effects of entrepreneurial decision-making, business experience and other factors on happiness by using China Household Finance Survey data. Our results derived from maximum likelihood estimation methods indicate that entrepreneurial decision-making and entrepreneurial experience affect household happiness significantly. The family well-being is significantly increased if the family is entrepreneurial, and it will be higher if actively entrepreneurial. Both entrepreneurial experience and entrepreneurial investment of time have significantly positive effect on the probability of family well-being. In addition, we find that the mechanism by which entrepreneurship brings happiness to households is through raising household income and wealth, that is, income effects and wealth effects.

TI  - WHAT SITUATIONS CAUSE CRUCIAL FINANCIAL DECISIONS WITHIN SOCIAL BUSINESSES?
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - The growing uncertainty in today's business environment has a significant influence on social business's behaviour. Those enterprises could rely on public support in the past, but nowadays, they have to find a way to be more responsible about their social activity and be financially independent on public resources. Based on this theoretical background, the paper's main goal was to find a set of factors that influence crucial financial decisions within a crisis. When social businesses create an optimal financial portfolio to be financially sustainable, primary research was conducted. A sample of 57 social businesses was asked about their financial strategy. The main research goal was to compare a change before and after the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic situation in 2020. This case has shown current financial thinking and preparedness for unusual or crises. A mixed research approach was chosen due to a limited number of respondents. The overall results found that those businesses prefer to use the current strategy (42%) in crisis, and they limit investments to survive in that situation, except marketing investments (16%).
   Implications for Central European audience: At the theoretical level, our study shows social enterprise concepts in the Central European context, which differs somewhat from the already established definition of mainly Anglo-Saxon and American authors. At the same time, it combines knowledge about the use of financial planning in this segment. The study results show that financial planning is essential in these companies because it can achieve social goals. A discussion would be opened on how to raise awareness of the preparation of the strategy. Alternatively, how to strengthen the financial literacy of managers or representatives of these entities.

TI  - Very good farmers, not particularly good business-people: A rural financial counsellor perspective on rural business failure
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Capitalising on the food and fibre opportunities of a burgeoning global population requires a high performing and resilient agribusiness sector. Necessarily, this includes a business focus to identify opportunities and implement strategies to ensure the delivery of food and fibre products demanded by the global marketplace while managing impacts of a dynamic operating environment. Current agriculture policy in Australia recognises the varying capacity of rural businesses to thrive in this environment and provides both indirect and direct welfare support. One example is the provision of a publicly funded financial counselling service to rural business in financial stress. This research has used interpretive description to better understand the drivers of the financial hardship experienced by businesses accessing the Rural Financial Counselling Service (RFCS). Guided interviews were conducted with 32 Rural financial Counsellors (RFC) who had at least five years experience in the role. Thematic analysis of the interviews highlighted the social, environmental and financial complexities impacting the successful operations of a rural business. The key finding of this research is that despite the myriad influences impacting businesses in this cohort, business failure reflected a lack of business skills, which could be aggregated under the umbrella terminology of business acumen. These skills are more nuanced than simply poor financial literacy, extending to the manner in which business operators understand the fundamentals of their business environment and are able to intervene to maximise the opportunities and mitigate the threats. Consequently, decision-makers focussed on production preferentially to the business of capitalising on that production. The research identified opportunities for research relating to the challenge of enhancing the business acumen of rural business decision-makers, as well as illuminating the business and social context of gender in rural business sustainability.

TI  - Family economic education, peer groups and students? entrepreneurial intention: the mediating role of economic literacy
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Stimulating potential entrepreneurs is a global challenge and policymakers need to understand factors affecting students' entrepreneurial intention. The growing body of literature has focused on the impact of entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intention, while this study aims to explore other predicted factors affecting students' entrepreneurial intention, such as family economic education, peer groups, and economic literacy. This study adopted a quantitative method using a survey approach to obtain comprehensive findings. The research involved online questionnaires to approximately 1000 students undergoing convenience sampling in a university in Indonesia as participants. The results indicated that both family economic education and peer groups positively correlate with economic literacy and students' entrepreneurial intention. These results confirmed a crucial role of economic literacy that government and educational institutions can consider to stimulate students' entrepreneurial intention. This study also contributes to the educational sector and governments to facilitate the creation of student-working groups in entrepreneurship as an attempt to encourage students' engagement.

TI  - TRANSVERSAL COMPETENCIES OF INNOVATIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROFESSIONALS IN LIFELONG EDUCATION
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - For the effective development of Ukraine in the conditions of global changes (political, economic, social, educational) the priority should be transition to a new economy - knowledge economy. The basis of knowledge economy will be the professional development of specialists in innovative business structures through lifelong learning, in particular formation of their transversal competencies. These qualitatively new specialists will be able to ensure the transition of companies to innovative forms of organization of production activities. The purpose of the article is to reveal the importance of transversal competencies formation among specialists of innovative business structures in lifelong learning to ensure competitiveness of Ukrainian companies at the international level. Methodology. To achieve the goal, general scientific and special research methods were used: comparative analysis and generalization - to study the international experience of innovative business structures; synthesis of theoretical and empirical data - to characterize Ukrainian companies according to the innovation index; structural-functional and system analysis - to study the features of knowledge economy and form hard, soft and business skills. Results. In formation of business structures, Ukraine still uses traditional criteria, while in the world there are innovative approaches - companies "gazelles", clusters, etc. Characteristic features and problems of gazelle companies functioning are analyzed, in particular concerning the personnel component. It is proposed to consider successful enterprises as centers of new economic zones, around which related enterprises, promotion infrastructure, clusters should be purposefully built. It is determined that national economic competitiveness is associated with knowledge and innovation driven capital. Two approaches to the management of business structures are analyzed. The first is based on implementation of subject-subject relationships, development of innovative transversal competencies in order to expand managers' "breadth of management skills" through La-education. The second is the experience of innovative enterprises, where management is transformed into information management with its inherent impersonal post / non / management. Formation of the phenomenon of transversal competencies on the basis of La-education is analyzed. This is ensured by changes in hard skills, acquisition of new soft skills and integrated business skills, which contributes to the creation of a new generation of professionals. It is determined that business skills are integrated from soft skills, which accumulate intellectual property knowledge, investment and financial literacy, sales skills, presentations and business negotiations, event management, project management, people, their work and time, etc. Emphasis is placed on the importance of forming knowledge economy based on the intellectual potential of society, in which the main levers are the processes of accumulation and use of information and its transformation into knowledge, which depends on the economic progress of the country. It is determined that on the basis of formation of scientific and educational clusters, introduction of crowd technologies, crowdsourcing in education during life the professional development of experts of innovative business structures will be provided. Practical importance.
   The results of the research can be used in the creation of training programs, retraining, reskilling and changing types of work in the modern production space, which include provisions of knowledge economy for professional development of innovative business structures through lifelong learning. The basic postulates of research can be useful for managers whose companies implement innovative approaches to management, the latest technologies in production activities and promote mobility in retraining in accordance with sociel needs. Correlation/originality. Conclusions reached will help economists, politologists, social scientists and LLL learning educators to understand the importance of innovative concepts in development business structures and formation transverse competencies based on hard, soft and business skills.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF THE BANKING SYSTEM LIQUIDITY ON THE VOLUME OF LENDING AND INVESTMENT IN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES DURING THE WAR
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - In the context of escalating military and political uncertainties, a crucial component of banking system stability is the establishment of an adequate level of resource provision - liquidity. The research aims to analyze the transmission impact of the banking system's liquidity and its structure on the volumes of financing for the real sector of the economy in the second year of the war in Ukraine. In the conditions of war and the corresponding intensification of military -political threats and uncertainties, the regulator has made numerous complex decisions and restrictions aimed at balancing the challenges with the current situation in financial markets. The research found that the banking sector of Ukraine currently accumulates a significant amount of excess liquidity and demonstrates high profitability. However, in the conditions of war, the transmission mechanism works improperly, requiring constant intervention from the regulator to balance the liquidity of the banking sector and state finances, which, in turn, affects the behavior of commercial banks and changes the structure of their asset portfolios. An analysis of the structure of active operations portfolios of the banking, corporate, and private sectors provide grounds to assert that there is no reason to expect a change in investment behavior from these groups in the perspective of the next year due to the specificity of the conditions imposed by the Ministry of Finance and the regulator. To maintain macroeconomic stability in the national economy in the conditions of martial law it is necessary to introduce conditions to reduce demand for foreign currency and, as an alternative, offer the preservation of savings solvency through simplifying access to investments in government securities for households. The low financial literacy of the population and the underdeveloped stock market in Ukraine, as well as the more complex mechanism of purchasing government bonds or military bonds compared to deposit services, make such investments by the population insignificant and limited in demand.

TI  - NGO responses to financial evaluation: auditability, purification and performance
T2  - ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose Literature has widely studied the financial accountability pressures on NGOs but rarely analysed how NGOs respond to them. This paper studies one large humanitarian NGO to address this question. It investigates the NGO's responses to understand the extent to which NGOs are able to regain control over their own work and turn the frames of evaluation and accountability to their own advantage. Design/methodology/approach This article draws on a case study of one of the largest French humanitarian NGOs. Interviews and observation (both participant and non-participant) were conducted in the financial department of the NGO. These data are supplemented with field-level contextual interviews. Findings In the NGO studied, institutional pressure is largely mediated by compliance audits. The paper thus traces the consequences of compliance audits for the NGO's central finance teams and describes how they respond. The findings detail three responses to evaluation. First, to respond to the burden of evaluation, the organisation makes itself auditable and develops preparedness. Second, to respond to the anxiety of evaluation, the organisation engages in a process of purification and succumbs to the allure of the single figure. Third, building on its newly acquired auditability and purity, the organisation performs itself as a "corporatised NGO". Together, these three responses constitute the NGO as an "entrepreneur" competing for eligibility, and financial literacy and managerialism become crucial to respond to pressure from institutional funders. Originality/value This paper extends the understanding of organisational responses to evaluation. The authors show the influence of evaluation systems on NGOs, but also how NGOs can react to regain control over their work and turn the frames of evaluation and accountability to their own advantage. However, despite several decades of calls for broader conceptions of NGO accountability, the case NGO prefers to promote a very narrow view of its performance, based solely on accounting compliance. It takes some pride in its ability to comply with funders' and auditors' demands. Turning a simple matter of compliance into a display of good performance, it builds a strategy and competitive advantage on its ability to respond competently to evaluation.

TI  - Credit counselling: a contemporary strategy for survival of micro small and medium-sized enterprises in under-developed financial markets post COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - PurposeThe main purpose of this paper is to establish the mediating effect of credit counselling in the relationship between access to microcredit and survival of micro small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa post COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda.Design/methodology/approachStructural equation modelling (SEM) through SmartPLS 4.0 was used to generate the standardized parameters to test whether credit counselling mediates the relationship between access to microcredit and survival of MSMEs in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa post COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda.FindingsThe SEM bootstrap results revealed that credit counselling enhances access to microcredit by 27% to promote survival of MSMEs in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa post COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda.Research limitationsThe current study focused only on women MSMEs. Future studies may possibly collect data from all the MSMEs to draw better generalization of the findings within the sector.Practical implicationsThe findings can help public finance policy to ensure provision of credit counselling to microentrepreneurs who borrow from different financial institutions to reduce the problem of loan defaults and delinquency rampant in lending. This could be done through conducting routine business education and counselling sessions for microentrepreneurs who often need credit to grow their businesses.Originality/valueThis study is amongst the first few studies to establish the mediating effect of credit counselling in the relationship between access to microcredit and survival of MSMEs in developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa in the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic with data collected from rural Uganda. There is a dearth in literature and theory on the rehabilitative and preventive role of credit counselling in reducing repayment defaults amongst borrowers within the credit market to spur survival of MSMEs seen as the main enabler of economic growth, especially in developing countries. In fact, credit counselling acts as a safety net by substituting financial literacy and education to solve the rampant problem of overindebtedness amongst borrowers who are debt illiterate within the credit market.

T2  - MANAGEMENT RESEARCH-THE JOURNAL OF THE IBEROAMERICAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to make an exploratory analysis of the impact of the entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) as defined by Acs et al. (2014) on opportunity-driven senior entrepreneurial activity in Latin America.Design/methodology/approachThe research uses data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute of five Latin America countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico), providing a total of 15,019 observations of people that are 50+ years old, between the years 2013 and 2017. A multi-level logistic regression model was used to estimate the relation between the total entrepreneurial activity by opportunity of seniors and some EE indicators. A total of three equations were estimated on the data set described.FindingsThis research confirms the relevance of some elements of EE on senior entrepreneurship in Latin America. Entrepreneurial attitudes have a positive relationship with senior entrepreneurs, generating higher levels of entrepreneurial ventures. The combination of institutions that support these attitudes on the EE enhances senior entrepreneurial activity. It also demonstrates that a higher level of entrepreneurial education at postschool stages is relevant to increasing senior entrepreneurial activity.Originality/valueThis research makes some interesting contributions in the field of measuring the impact of EE on senior entrepreneurship by opportunity in developing countries, filling a literature gap. It allows us to glimpse some measures that policymakers could take to improve the entrepreneurial activity of this segment in the region, such as implementing programs that facilitate networking opportunities and mentorship, along with providing training in business and financial literacy.

TI  - Women's Entrepreneurship and Government Policy: Facilitating Access to Credit through a National Program in Chile
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - In this paper, I evaluate the impact of a multidimensional national program implemented in Chile during the second term of President Bachelet to facilitate female entrepreneurs' access to credit, reduce gender gaps in financial inclusion, and change patriarchal stereotypes. I construct a difference-in-difference estimate of the program. My findings indicate that the program has successfully met its principal aim: the loans granted to women have increased, reducing the gender gap in this dimension. In addition, evidence of heterogeneity by the economic sector has emerged. This evidence aligns with prior research that has emphasised that public policies should not be designed and implemented under the logic of "one type of program fits all". The program analysed in this study is an example of a national public policy that has improved female entrepreneurs' access to funding, reduced gender gaps in a Latin American country, and potentially offered lessons to other Latin American and middle-income countries worldwide.

TI  - SME manager's perceived cooperative support, commitment and trust on learning and entrepreneurship orientation for firm innovation
T2  - HUMAN SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT
AB  - BACKGROUND: The upsurge of the SME failure rate in developing economies has triggered the need to foster entrepreneurial skills, awareness, and appropriate knowledge. One of the ways of effective learning is through coming together in a cooperative.
   OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on analyzing the influence of members' cooperative support, commitment, and trust on members' firms' entrepreneurship and learning orientation. The study also assesses the association of entrepreneurship and learning orientation on their firm innovation performance. The study further examines the mediating role of entrepreneurship and learning orientation on perceived cooperative support, commitment, and trust-innovation performance relationship.
   METHODS: SPSS was used to calculate descriptive statistics and the partial least square (PLS) structural equation modeling employing Smart PLS software 23.
   RESULTS: The general results indicate that perceived cooperative support, commitment, and trust have a significant and positive association with entrepreneurship and learning orientation, except for trust versus entrepreneurship association with entrepreneurship orientation displayed insignificant results. Entrepreneurship and learning orientation confirmed to have a strong significant positive influence on firm innovation performance. The entrepreneurship and learning orientation significantly mediate perceived cooperative support, commitment, and trust-innovation performance relationship.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fostering saving and credits cooperatives societies should not just aim at providing financial support to its members but create associations that will orient entrepreneurial spirit to its members and attract members wise utilization of the funds accessed.

TI  - Entrepreneurial Motivation, Competency and Micro-Enterprise Sustainability Performance: Evidence from an Emerging Economy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Small to medium-sized enterprises suffer from loss of competitive advantage, low productivity, and poor performance because of inadequate competencies. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to examine the effect of selected motivational dimensions (i.e., self-improvement, self-confidence, openness to change, pull factors, and the need for achievement) on entrepreneurial competency among micro-entrepreneurs. We used a cross-sectional design and collected quantitative data from 403 micro-entrepreneurs in Malaysia using random sampling. SEM-PLS was used for data analysis. The findings revealed that self-confidence, openness to change, and pull factors positively influenced entrepreneurial competencies. Moreover, there was a positive effect of self-confidence, pull factors, need for achievement, and entrepreneurial competency on enterprise sustainability performance. Furthermore, entrepreneurial competencies significantly mediated the effect of self-confidence, openness to change, and pull factors on enterprise sustainability performance. Apart from extending the lens of a resource-based view, this study enriches enterprise sustainability literature from emerging nations' perspective. Policymakers can strengthen their programs and policies to improve the entrepreneurial competencies of micro-entrepreneurs and their business sustainability.

TI  - The COVID-19 Crises: The Threats, Uncertainties and Risks in Entrepreneurial Development
T2  - RISKS
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and its different waves brought several complications to people's social lives and massively affected business activities worldwide. Accordingly, in this study, we explored the various COVID-19 threats, uncertainties, and risks that are faced by entrepreneurship, propensity, and development. We applied a deductive approach in this study and utilized cross-sectional data that we collected through a questionnaire. We based this study's findings on 320 valid cases. By employing structural equation modeling (SEM), we reveal that factors, such as quality of business environment (QoBE) and access to financial resources (AtFR,) have a positive and significant impact on entrepreneurial propensity (EP). On the other hand, the findings reveal that two factors, namely the uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (UoCOVID-19) and the risk perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic (RPoCOVID-19), have a negative effect on EP. This study's findings provide valuable information about the COVID-19 pandemic and, on particular, on the development of EP among university students. In addition, this study's findings guide and support policymakers and higher authorities in understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and other business-related factors for developing EP. Further, these findings support the creation of conducive business environments even during a global pandemic or another natural disaster. Finally, this study's findings contribute other empirical evidence to enrich previous research on health, business, and management.

TI  - Investment behaviour of women entrepreneurs
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the new kind of investors women entrepreneurs and to find out the factors that drive their investment behaviour and investment decisions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach of qualitative enquiry was used for the research in which 18 in-depth exploratory interviews were conducted to identify the determinants of the investment behaviour shown by women entrepreneurs, a growing segment in investment. The accumulated data was analysed using open coding.
   Findings - The research show that en entrepreneurs consider investment as a. long-term instrument are risk averse and quite conservative. They are willing to take risks in business but not for making investment decisions. The reasons for this low-risk behaviour include lack of time to understand investments and lack of knowledge about various products. The research asserts that if they spend time to be informed about the nuances of investment instruments, they are likely to take risks for their investments as well. The interviews also reflect that women entrepreneurs often mimic the investment behaviour of their parents.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample for this research was taken from only two cities in India and a broader research in other cities as well will expand the understanding of investment behaviours demonstrated by women entrepreneurs. The differences in women entrepreneurs investment behaviour due to culture and ethnicity of the respondent are also not considered.
   Practical implications - The outcomes of the research will help the investment manager to get a better insight into the psychology of women entrepreneurs as investors. This will help them develop personalized and relevant portfolio recommendations. Second, the findings will help service providers to develop training modules for their investment advisors by sensitizing them to needs and wants of women entrepreneurs as potential investors. Third, the research will be of interest for policymakers and researchers to understand the determinants of personal investment decision-making amongst women entrepreneurs. Finally, it will help women entrepreneurs understand and mitigate their biases while taking investment decisions. It will lead them to take wiser investment decisions, thereby reducing the risk and maximizing opportunities of returns.
   Social implications - The research will provide opportunities for enhancing gender equality amongst investors. This can be achieved by educating the investment advisors on the traits and preferences of women entrepreneurs as investors. Designing and delivering specific workshops on investment awareness for women entrepreneurs can also be accomplished based on the findings of this research.
   Originality/value - To the researcher's best knowledge, the investment behaviour of women entrepreneurs in India has been little investigated. This study appears to be the first qualitative 'research attempt in that direction. This paper will be useful in understanding he behavioural biases by women entrepreneurs in considering their personal investment decisions.

TI  - Entrepreneurship Competence Model for Supporting Learners Development at All Educational Levels
T2  - ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - The development of entrepreneurship competence considering a broad view of entrepreneurship requires a systematic approach to determine the validated content of learning and methodological basis for supporting learners' entrepreneurial attitudes and behaviour. There is still relatively little research in this area at all levels of education. Addressing entrepreneurship competence as key competence of lifelong learning allows to broaden the understanding and describe the development of different aspects of entrepreneurship competence through meaningful and supportive interactions in the learning environment. This will allow a better understanding of how to support entrepreneurship competence in various courses and age groups. In this article, a framework of entrepreneurship competence called the Comprehensive Entrepreneurship Competence Model (CECM) is proposed. The development of an entrepreneurship competence model relies on the theory of systems thinking. The CECM model focuses on the developmental perspective (fundamental processes of human development) that is not emphasised in other models. The article also suggests how to support the development of entrepreneurship competence systematically at all levels of education through embedding entrepreneurship competence into the curricula, study programmes of different subjects and overall learning processes.

TI  - Assessing the management student's entrepreneurial intentions: Role of entrepreneurship education and technology transfer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Entrepreneurship education is considered as an important way to influence the competitiveness of any country or industry. Therefore, entrepreneurship education provides opportunities to progress to a more competitive educational environment. This paper examines the impact of students' entrepreneurship education in China on their entrepreneurial intentions. Perceived entrepreneurial capacity, education in entrepreneurship, and attitudes toward entrepreneurship are all factors in the model developed to predict entrepreneurial intention. Structured equation modeling (SEM) is being used to test 98 management students from various universities in China. The findings show that there is statistically significant and positive relationship among entrepreneurship learning, entrepreneurial attitude, entrepreneurship education, and management students' entrepreneurial intention. Perceived behavioral control and perceive social rule significantly improve management students' entrepreneurial intention. Moreover, technology transfer correlates statistically with students' entrepreneurial intentions. Thus, universities are being encouraged to offer entrepreneurial training modules to increase their students' entrepreneurial intent.

TI  - A BP Neural Network-Based Method for Evaluating the Quality of Creative Education in Minority Regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS
AB  - Ethnic minority resources are very rich and contain rich historical resources and culture. Under the impact of modern information technology, the development of minority resources and the inheritance of ethnic culture are facing many challenges, and the current school education is lagging behind in exploring the ecological resources of minority groups, which makes the integration of creative education and minority groups encounter a bottleneck. In response to this situation, we make full use of the platform of creative education to actively explore the traditional skills contained in the lives of ethnic minorities. In the evaluation of creative education, we should not only focus on the evaluation of students' works, but also on the improvement of students' knowledge of various creative tools, their ability to use comprehensive subject knowledge, hands-on ability, solution ability and creativity ability during the whole learning process. Based on this, this paper proposes a back propagation neural network (BPNN)-based quality evaluation method for creative education to evaluate the quality of creative education from multiple dimensions. Experiments and comparisons show that the BPNN-based evaluation method proposed in this paper can better evaluate the whole process of creative education and help the further development of creative education in minority regions.

TI  - Impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThe study focused on the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs at the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia, from 2019 to 2023.Design/methodology/approachThe design of the paper is empirical-analytical, focusing on the tangible and unique aspects of reality that can be fragmented for measurement. This approach privileges the use of data from the study population's experience, which is treated analytically through statistics to establish frequencies and correlations between variables. The research involved a structured questionnaire based on bibliographic references and considering the operational framework of the variables, which underwent expert review, necessary adjustments, a pilot test and subsequent validation in 2019 and 2023. The reliability of the instrument was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, ensuring a reliable indicator when equal to or greater than 0.7 in each analysis period. This methodology aimed to identify practices and how the financial profile influences short term.FindingsThe findings from the survey conducted with the microentrepreneurs at Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center reveal several significant connections to the theoretical framework. The study revealed that many microentrepreneurs relied on their personal funds for business financing, indicating a limited understanding of financial principles. Additionally, a significant portion of microentrepreneurs mitigated investment risk by securing loans from financial institutions, yet none utilized government subsidies like entrepreneurship loans, pointing to a lack of advice. The findings underscore the importance of financial education and suitable financial services for business development.Research limitations/implicationsOne limitation of this study is the lack of detailed data on the financial structure of microentrepreneurs' businesses, as well as specific information on interest rates and the terms and conditions of the microcredit used. These limitations may affect the generalization of the results and the comprehensive understanding of the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs. Future research could include a larger sample size and more accurate data on the financial structure of businesses, as well as a detailed investigation of interest rates and terms and conditions of microcredit, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the financial impacts for microentrepreneurs.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study have practical implications for microentrepreneurs in the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center. The research emphasizes the need for improved financial knowledge, accounting practices and debt management among microentrepreneurs. It also highlights the importance of financial education and access to suitable financial services for business development. The study's insights can guide the development of training programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing financial literacy and financial management among microentrepreneurs, leading to more informed decision-making and improved financial outcomes.Social implicationsFrom a social perspective, this research contributes to promoting economic development and financial inclusion. By addressing the mismanagement of microcredit by microentrepreneurs and providing insights into their short-term finances, the study aims to foster economic empowerment and sustainable development within communities.
   The findings underscore the significance of microfinance in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. The research emphasizes the importance of equitable access to financial services, which can contribute to narrowing the gap between the financially excluded population and the conventional financial system.Originality/valueThis research adds originality and value to the academic community by addressing the incidence of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs in the specific context of the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia. By characterizing the financial profile of microentrepreneurs, establishing the relationship between microcredit characteristics and the financial profile and proposing an action plan, the study provides valuable insights for decision-making in both the academic and microfinance fields. The research contributes to the existing literature on microfinance and financial inclusion, offering a unique perspective and potential solutions for optimizing the use of microcredit-funded resources by microentrepreneurs.

TI  - Marketplace lending of small- and medium-sized enterprises
T2  - STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP JOURNAL
AB  - Research Summary When evaluating Internet-based loan project of small and medium size enterprises (SME), lenders can rely on easy-to-understand risk ratings or more sophisticated financial information. We investigate lenders decisions and its effect on loan funding success on the marketplace-lending platform Zencap. The data set has been provided by the platform Zencap and includes 414 SME marketplace loans and 2,196 lenders. The data examined provide strong support for the importance of simple platform ratings in influencing investor behavior, while the effect of more detailed financial information is less pronounced, controlling for relevant variables. Higher interest rates appear more profitable to investors without any serious concern about non-repayment. Managerial Summary Platform managers and potential borrowers are interested in how to encourage lenders to pledge their money on marketplace-lending platforms. We investigate the influence of easy-to-understand risk ratings and more sophisticated financial information on investment decisions and their effect on loan funding success on the marketplace-lending platform Zencap. We investigate 414 SME marketplace loans and 2,196 lenders. We find that for marketplace lending on Zencap the effect of more detailed financial information is less pronounced than easy-to-understand risk ratings. Platforms base risk ratings on information other than the entrepreneurs' financial information.

TI  - Fintech Concept and Current Fintech Applications Used in Islamic Financial Institutions
T2  - KOCATEPE ISLAMI ILIMLER DERGISI
AB  - Fintech investments worldwide, which were 8.2 billion dollars in 2017, reached 238.9 billion dollars in 2021. In 2021, the fintech sector reached a record high of 7,321 deals and received a total of 164 billion dollars in investments with 6,000 deals in 2022. The study aims to present Islamic fintech application areas in T & uuml;rkiye in a holistic manner by examining the effects of the fintech sector on Islamic finance and traditional financial markets. It also examines whether Islamic financial institutions have been able to keep pace with the transformation. The study was conducted with qualitative research methods. In the study, data collection methods such as interviews, observation, document analysis, etc., were used to solve the problem. At the same time, the research was evaluated in a realistic manner with an interrogative and interpretive technique. The data were compiled for the purpose of solving the complex situation of the subject, addressing it together and making a final holistic evaluation of the flow of social life. In the age of rapidly developing technology, change and transformation are also evident in the financial system. It is thought that the concept of 'Fintech', which is a combination of the words finance and technology, will have an important place in the financial markets in the future. Fintech, which first manifested themselves in ATMs used for withdrawing and depositing money, then manifested themselves with POS devices or internet and mobile banking technology. In this study, fintech are introduced and their effects on Islamic fintech and traditional financial markets are analyzed. Considering that there is a sufficient amount of studies on fintech in T & uuml;rkiye but few studies on Islamic fintech, it is thought that the study will be original. In the study, a detailed examination of financial technology and Islamic financial technology in T & uuml;rkiye and the world has been made. Financial technology companies operating in the field of fintech operate in a total of 13 areas, including payments, banking, blockchain, corporate finance and insurance. The findings of the study include remote customer acquisition, facilitating banking services through mobile applications and increasing financial literacy, and promoting Islamic banking products through an entrepreneurial web game, most of which have been implemented concretely through Islamic fintech in T & uuml;rkiye. In addition, participation banks, the transformation of mobile phones into POS devices with Mobile POS applications, the 'cash simple' application that allows you to deposit or withdraw money without going to an ATM or branch, the ability to determine the credit score of participation banks' customers with artificial intelligence application without the need for past banking data, the 'kabbage' application that enables participation banks to fully automate loan application processes for SMEs are among the findings of the study as applications in the transformation process of Islamic fintech. In addition, robo-consultancies that provide virtual finance consultancy services that contribute significantly to reducing costs developed using artificial intelligence technology, selim, a digital assistant developed with artificial intelligence technology that constantly improves itself and learns new things, and the garage and guild application that offers incubation centers and acceleration programs launched by Kuveyt T & uuml;rk and Albaraka T & uuml;rk can be counted among the important fintechs.
   In addition to these, the venture capital investment funds developed by Kuveyt T & uuml;rk and Albaraka T & uuml;rk, Vak & imath;f Participation and Neova Insurance, the idea platform developed by Kuveyt T & uuml;rk that enables entrepreneurs, university students and all customers to realize their innovative ideas on banking products and services as well as many other different subjects, the digital Turkish Lira step initiated by the Central Bank of the Republic of T & uuml;rkiye, and the mobile applications that offer financial asset trading and analysis launched by Kuveyt T & uuml;rk and Albaraka T & uuml;rk can be counted among the prominent Islamic fintech in the sector. As a result of the evaluations made during the study process, it can be stated that Islamic fintech applications will add dynamism to the Islamic finance market and provide a competitive advantage with their advantages such as low cost, 24/7 accessibility, transparency, reliability, operational convenience and new products. In addition, there are also negative factors such as data security, cybercrimes, money laundering, legal gaps, lack of infrastructure, and non-compliance with the rules of Islamic law, which can be shown among the disadvantages of fintech. It can be said that it would be beneficial for financial institutions to take these factors into consideration in their transformation processes. When Islamic fintech initiatives in T & uuml;rkiye and the response to them are evaluated together, it can be said that Islamic fintech have benefited from the fintech transformation by significantly differentiating from conventional fintech.

TI  - Developing an agricultural entrepreneur inclination model for sustainable agriculture by integrating expert mining and ISM-MICMAC
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Agribusiness is undergoing a global transition from ordinary cultivation to an agro-industrial sector. Agripreneurship is a new way of transforming agriculture into an enterprise in current business practices. This paper is written in the context of India, where many efforts have been made to encourage sustainable economic growth and development over the past decades. However, no significant progress has been seen in the agri-industry. The Indian agricultural sector is also afflicted with several other challenges related to the globalized economy, natural resource degradation, widespread rural poverty, and increasing competitiveness. In this study, we have endeavored to create an agripreneur inclination model in the context of the Indian rural sector. The objective of this study is to identify programs and policies that effectively support the development of agripreneurs. We also attempt to identify the characteristics of individuals who are more likely to become agripreneurs. The methodology we have used is based on the ISM-MICMAC technique. The findings show that agripreneur courses, agricultural policies, training and development modules, government cooperation, and the involvement of institutional heads play an essential role in inspiring the younger generation toward agripreneurship. This study's findings will help policy makers design effective policies to motivate the younger generation to consider the agricultural sector as a career option.

TI  - Development of Local Economy through the Strengthening of Small-Medium-Sized Forest Enterprises in KPK, Pakistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Small-medium-sized forest enterprises (SMFEs) have historically played an essential role in developing countries' economies worldwide because most businesses start as small businesses, and government support and knowledge-based recourse are critical to the sustainable development of SMFEs and local economies. The current studies examined the effects of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) government's (Pakistan) support (GS) and entrepreneur knowledge (EK) on the development of small-medium-sized forest enterprises (SD) and their contribution to the local economic development (LED) of the region. Primary data were collected from 350 SMFEs in KPK, Pakistan. The model was developed by using a structural equation model (SEM) to investigate the impact of GS, EK, and SMFEs on the growth, SG, and sustainable development of the local economy. This study concludes that EK and GS could increase growth in SMFE businesses and contribute to LED. On the other hand, crediting loans and equipping businesses with training could not directly affect SMFE businesses and LED growth. The government needs to use natural resources and the SMFE communities as leaders among suppliers in the local market for the sustainable development of LED and SMFEs, alongside focusing on preserving and taking initiatives to develop. This study discusses several practical implications for policymakers, business owners, and academics, with recommendations for future research.

TI  - The Performance of Time-Preference and Risk-Preference Measures in Surveys
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - Time preferences and risk preferences play an important role in a wide range of behavior, including financial decisions, entrepreneurship, and the proper incentivizing of agents. Numerous methods have been developed to measure these preferences hypothetically in surveys, but they have yielded inconsistent results. We analyze a panel data set in which subjects have collectively answered more than 400 surveys including 15 time preference and 36 risk-preference elicitations. We evaluate the performance of these measures using the criteria of (1) ability to predict economically important behavior and (2) distinctness from other observables. We find substantial heterogeneity in the predictiveness of the measures. The best performing measure for time-preference is a titration method, in which a sequence of adaptive binary-choice questions narrows in on a subject's indifference point, and for risk-preference it is a self-report measure of risk aversion. Using factor analysis, we find that time preferences are well explained by a single factor, but risk preferences load on multiple factors. However, the first factor loads almost entirely on self-reported risk-preference measures, and this factor explains much of the variation. The evidence can help inform researchers about which elicitation methods to include in their surveys.

TI  - Borrow to be the poor or the rich? It depends: Credit market and wealth accumulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - We investigate the relationship between access to credit and wealth accumulation to understand the rising wealth inequality. Empirical results suggest an asymmetric heterogeneity over the whole range of wealth distribution. There is a significantly negative relationship between house-hold debt and wealth accumulation for poor households but a significantly positive relationship for wealthy households. Wealthy households could better benefit from the investment debt, but poor households fail. We discuss the two channels of entrepreneurship and investment behaviors. This paper contributes to the literature on wealth distribution by mapping the relationships between the credit market and household wealth accumulation.

TI  - SELECTED FACTORS OF CORPORATE MANAGEMENT IN SMEs SECTOR
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - The study aims to define and present important factors affecting the quality of company management in the SMEs sector. Within the realized research, the authors focused on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. In the CR, the data from 454 companies were obtained, and from 368 companies in Slovakia. For data processing, chi-squared test and Z-score were used. The research results provided interesting findings. It has been found that entrepreneurs spend a lot of time doing their business activities, since about 70% of entrepreneurs in both countries confirmed that they spend more than 8 hours a day doing their business activities. On the other hand, the authors' assumptions were not confirmed, as higher intensity in entrepreneurship had been expected. An interesting finding was that larger and older companies more intensively agreed with the statement ST1 - they work intensively in their business (management). About three quarters of the entrepreneurs interviewed stated that they apply the participative management style. Based on the results, it can be stated that larger companies, older companies, and university-educated entrepreneurs largely apply this management style. The research has shown that entrepreneurs greatly appreciate people in their enterprises, which is more clearly evident in older companies than in younger companies. A large proportion of entrepreneurs pay considerable attention to regular employee evaluation and try to motivate them to apply innovative workflows.

TI  - How endogenous risk preferences and sample selection affect analysis of firm survival
T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - The roles of selection and endogeneity in measured risk preferences are illustrated using the correlation between risk attitudes and firm survival. Selection bias occurs when risk attitudes are elicited only from current entrepreneurs so that the risk attitudes of unsuccessful entrepreneurs are excluded from the analysis. Risk attitudes measured after agents enter entrepreneurship will endogenously reflect business success. Data on entrepreneurs from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics shows that when risk attitudes are measured subject to selection and endogeneity, mixed or even positive correlations between risk acceptance and the probability of firm exit occur. However, firm exits fall monotonically with willingness to accept risk when risk preference measures are not subject to selection or endogeneity related to business success.

TI  - Investment Motivations and UK Business Angels' Appetite for Risk Taking: The Moderating Role of Experience
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - In this paper we use a large UK survey of business angels (BAs) investing in two different publicly supported schemes to directly question the role that investment motivations play in shaping investors' appetite for risk. We dive deeper into the relationship between investment reasons and risk taking, by exploring the potential for a moderating effect derived from BAs' past experience (i.e. financial and entrepreneurial experience). Our analysis reveals that both investment reasons (for return and for passion) have substantial explanatory power in shaping angels' risk attitude, but their effect is moderated by the investors' prior experience. This key finding represents important empirical support for what has so far been anecdotal evidence concerning BAs' appetite for risk when investing.

TI  - Are "Voluntary" Self-Employed Better Prepared for Retirement Than "Forced" Self-Employed?
T2  - WORK AGING AND RETIREMENT
AB  - When it comes to financial preparation for retirement, self-employed workers in many European countries face unique challenges not encountered by traditional wage earners. This is particularly true for self-employed workers because many self-employed individuals do not have large-scale access to employer-sponsored pensions, which are a mainstay of pension support for most workers in developed countries. In this investigation, we explored the saving practices and perceived future pension adequacy of self-employed workers aged 15-65 in Germany (N = 702) and the Netherlands (N = 655). Of particular interest for understanding saving practices was whether respondents felt that they voluntarily chose to become self-employed, or whether they felt "forced" to enter self-employment due to economic or labor market pressures. Forced self-employed individuals-some 25% of those who became selfemployed out of necessity-were found to be less likely to save for retirement than their voluntary self-employed counterparts, and they envisioned a less optimistic future pension scenario for themselves. Discussion focuses on the need to change institutional practices and public policies that place self-employed individuals at a disadvantage-particularly those who are driven into self-employment based on economic pressures and a lack of opportunities in the traditional labor market.

TI  - Navigating uncertainties: a tri-factorial evaluation of risk management adoption in MSMEs
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - The study explores the implementation of risk management in Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia, with the objective of enhancing their adoption and fostering sustainable business practices. Despite the overarching goal, many MSMEs in Indonesia still lag in the implementation of risk management. The research specifically targets MSMEs without existing internal control and risk management systems. The questionnaire was distributed to 200 MSME representatives through an online Google Form. Out of these, we received 140 completed responses. After a thorough review for completeness and relevance to the study criteria, 111 responses were deemed suitable for analysis, resulting in a response rate of 70%. After the data is obtained, it is analyzed using partial least squares using smart-pls 4.0. Relative advantage (RA) is the most influential indicator on Adoption of Risk Identification (ARI). Other important factors are complexity (COMX), and security (SECU) for MSMEs. Conversely, organizational readiness (OR) and competitive pressure (CP) were found not to have a significant impact on ARI, suggesting these are not primary factors in enhancing risk identification adoption and business sustainability. These findings provide insightful implications for the strategic prioritization of risk management components in the Indonesian MSME sector.

TI  - Global drivers of cryptocurrency infrastructure adoption
T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - A vast digital ecosystem of entrepreneurship and exchange has sprung up with Bitcoin's digital infrastructure at its core. We explore the worldwide spread of infrastructure necessary to maintain and grow Bitcoin as a system (Bitcoin nodes) and infrastructure enabling the use of bitcoins for everyday economic transactions (Bitcoin merchants). Specifically, we investigate the role of legal, criminal, financial, and social determinants of the adoption of Bitcoin infrastructure. We offer some support for the view that the adoption of cryptocurrency infrastructure is driven by perceived failings of traditional financial systems, in that the spread of Bitcoin infrastructure is associated with low trust in banks and the financial system among inhabitants of a region, and with the occurrence of country-level inflation crises. On the other hand, our findings also suggest that active support for Bitcoin is higher in locations with well-developed banking services. Finally, we find support for the view that bitcoin adoption is also partly driven by cryptocurrencies' usefulness in engaging in illicit trade.

TI  - Academic abilities, education and performance in the stock market
T2  - JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE
AB  - The paper assesses how cognitive abilities and education affect the performance of individual investors in the stock market. We use an exhaustive NASDAQ Tallinn dataset covering two bull markets and one bear market. We show that stronger mathematical and overall academic abilities are associated with more profitable investments and relative outperformance, after trading style, income, experience and a variety of educational characteristics are controlled for. However, the effects are not always linear or monotonic. A similar positive effect on performance is produced by higher education or specialisation in certain subjects. None of these factors is able to explain the performance of investors during bear markets, and none is a substitute for experience. Investors with strong academic abilities tend to have moderate trading frequency and performance seems to be affected more by the ability to find good trades than by the use of any particular trading strategies.

TI  - Are annuities an inferior or normal good? Evidence from a less-developed country
T2  - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB  - One crucial decision made at retirement in Chile is whether to acquire an annuity or a phased withdrawal (PW) scheme. Annuities, unlike PW, do not allow for inheritance and provide smaller initial pension benefits while protecting against longevity and capital market risks. If preferences show decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA), then an annuity (insurance) should be considered an inferior good. We test this hypothesis on Chilean data using a binary choice model. Our results reject the DARA hypothesis for the whole sample. However, after splitting the sample into low- and high-income groups, we find that the former have increasing absolute risk aversion (IARA) behavior, whereas the latter have DARA behavior. These findings suggest that policy programs encouraging retirement savings, such as tax breaks and subsidies, should be approached with caution depending on the balance of high and low-income individuals, particularly in less-developed economies.

TI  - Resistance to swelling of strategic gender disparity: support of microfinance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP & SMALL BUSINESS
AB  - Is enhanced income-generating ability due to microfinance participation has any impact on women empowerment? The current research explores riposte to the perennial research questions associated with social impact and gender disparity. More specifically, the researchers have tried to estimate the impact of microfinance participation on strategic gender need (SGN) decision-making. The researcher has collected information on different aspects of SGN and the socio-economic condition of 660 microfinance beneficiaries spread over four districts through a well-structured schedule. Rapid rural appraisal (RRA) technique was used to understand the working of self-help groups (SHGs) and the beneficiary's role in business and household activity. A probit model was used to estimate the impact of microfinance on SGN decision-making. Out of nine variables of SGN decision-making, microfinance participation, significantly impacts control over own income and creation of business assets. Microcredit participation has minimised the influence of patriarchal society and empowered women to take strategic decision independently. The impact assessment studies in microfinance were primarily focused on economic and social empowerment. Little reviews were found on the minimisation of gender inequalities. The current research is innovative in measuring the impact of microfinance on gender disparity minimisation.

AB  - We study the effects of two exogenous modifications in the Swedish pension system application form nudging individuals towards a fixed-term payout. Meanwhile, the set of available options and the default option-life annuity-were unchanged during the period under study. We examine the effects on individuals' payout decisions and the spillover effects on labour supply and other pensions using a difference-in-difference framework and detailed administrative data on actual payout decisions and a wide range of individual-level outcomes. Each modification increased the demand for the nudged payout by around 30 percentage points. The first modification also induced individuals to work less.

TI  - Cognitive Bias and the Extraversion Personality Shaping the Behavior of Investors
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The paper examines the direct and indirect effects (via investors' risk perception) of heuristic biases on investors' irrational behavior in decision-making. The study also investigates the moderating effect of investors' extraversion on both the direct and the indirect associations between heuristic biases and irrational decision-making. Based on survey data collected from 247 investors registered in various brokerage houses in Pakistan and the analyses (mediation and moderation) performed using the Process Macro technique (proposed by Hayes, 2017) in SPSS, the results of this study reveal that heuristic biases positively affect investors' irrational decision-making both directly and indirectly via risk perception. The results reveal that extraversion moderates both direct and indirect associations between heuristic biases and investors' irrational behavior in decision-making. Our findings carry useful practical implications for organizations' policymakers.
