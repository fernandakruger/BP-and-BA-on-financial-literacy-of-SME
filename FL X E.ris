AB  - The main obstacles to migrant workers starting businesses when they return to their hometowns are their own lack of financial literacy and aptitude, a lack of sufficient venture capital, and inadequate financing options. This paper conducts an analysis of the opportunities and challenges under the rural revitalization environment in conjunction with the Internet of Things Technology, through which a migrant labor entrepreneurship analysis platform is built. Data crawling technology is applied to capture internet data resources related to innovative entrepreneurship in the data collection module, and the entrepreneurship data is processed by the Internet of Things Technology. Based on the research, the approach suggested in this paper has its benefits for analyzing the opportunities and difficulties that migrant workers encounter in a rural revitalization context, in order to finally provide some theoretical support for pertinent research. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The study of financial literacy and sustainability has attracted much interest recently and is expanding quickly. This paper offers a trustworthly, consistent, and current financial literacy and sustainability analysis following bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review. Concerning 127 documents published between 2008 and October 2022, we specifically examined the co-occurrence of author keywords, co-citation analysis of cited references, and subsequent in-depth analysis. Results show that the following topics have received the most attention in analyzing financial literacy and sustainability research: (1) financial inclusion; (2) financial behaviour; (3) financial systems; and (4) decision-making. The trick-down growth and development theory, the consumption function theory, the resource-based view theory, and the theory of entrepreneurship are the theoretical pillars supporting this study's structure. Next, we create an integrative framework as the foundation for additional research. As a result, this review provides a thorough overview of financial literacy and sustainability research.  © 2023 Idris Ahmad et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Household leverage ratio is an important factor affecting family stability. Digital finance has changed the means of payment and consumption frequency, but the relationship between digital finance and household leverage ratio is still unclear. The existence of household debt is defined as the existence of leverage. The higher the household debt, the greater the household leverage. Based on the matching data of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) 2019 and the China Digital Inclusive Finance Index, this paper studies the impact of digital finance on household leverage ratio and explores its mechanism theoretically and empirically. This research finds that digital finance can significantly promote the household leverage ratio and this conclusion is still valid after instrumental variable method and robustness test. The mechanism analysis shows that digital finance can promote household over-consumption and further expand household leverage ratio. Digital finance can also reduce household leverage ratio by increasing household income. The heterogeneity analysis suggests that the role of digital finance in expanding leverage ratio is stronger for urban areas and households with low educational level. For households with higher assets, digital finance helps to reduce leverage ratio. Therefore, the government should guide residents to consume rationally and give full play to the entrepreneurship-facilitating and income-increasing effect of digital finance. Meanwhile, the residents themselves should speed up the cultivation of digital financial literacy, which is of vital significance for lowering household leverage ratio and systemic financial risks. China’s development level of digital finance ranks among the top in the world. Studying the role of digital finance in China is helpful to provide experience reference for countries around the world. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - This study analyses the effects of financial literacy and digital financial capabilities in shaping entrepreneurs’ preferences for ethical financial intermediaries and sustainable investment decisions. Exploiting novel survey data on Italian micro-enterprises, we find that more financially literate business owners have higher preferences for intermediaries with a strong ethical stance, are more likely to make investments inspired by environmental and social criteria and have a higher awareness of sustainable financial products. Moreover, digital financial competencies are found to play a significant role in enhancing preferences for ethical intermediaries and sustainable investment decisions. Finally, we show that the beneficial effect of financial literacy is mostly direct, while the indirect effect operating through higher digital financial abilities, despite being statistically significant, impacts firms’ sustainable financing and investing decisions only to a lower extent. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Small and medium-sized enterprise plays a significant role in economic development by creating jobs, increasing wealth, and reducing poverty. The present study was conducted in the industrial area of Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula (India). Data was collected from entrepreneurial and managerial classes of the SME sector through a questionnaire through direct personal investigation. The survey was conducted using the questionnaire’s non-probability purposive sampling method. The findings indicate that financial education is the most significant factor affecting SME success, followed by access to financing, which considerably affects SME performance. The data suggests that financial risk has a negative effect on SME performance, although the impact is not statistically significant. Furthermore, the significance of a variable’s power may be determined by examining whether the sample means fall within confidence intervals. SMEs should be well educated to access alternative funding channels to the banking system that provide feasible alternatives for accomplishing value creation objectives.

AB  - Using a representative survey of Dutch entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals, (i) we measure their subjective financial knowledge and the extent to which they ask for advice when managing their companies, and (ii) we examine whether subjective financial knowledge and the demand for advice are related to the firm economic performance. We find that the respondents feel more comfortable with accounting subjects than they do with strategic ones, of which they feel that they know the least. Entrepreneurs with a greater extent of financial knowledge are more likely to report a higher gross margin and higher revenue growth for their firm. These entrepreneurs are also less likely to seek advice and to delegate financial decisions. Seeking professional advice does not increase the likelihood of an entrepreneur having better performance. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs’ degree of financial knowledge is related to the success of their businesses, while seeking advice is not significantly correlated with better firm performance. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study intends to handle the latter gap: different results of the determinants of financial inclusion, i.e., financial literacy, age, income, and education. Furthermore, it applies the quantitative design, examining the statistical hypotheses. Additionally, the snowball sampling method chose the population of female entrepreneurs in Indonesia. Through the survey in 2022, this study effectively obtained one hundred and fifty-two samples and their responses. Furthermore, the logistic regression model and classification matrix analyze the obtained data. According to this study’s measurements of access, savings, and credit accounts (AA, SA, and CA), financial literacy effectively increases the financial inclusion of female entrepreneurs. At the same time, demographic features, i.e., age, income, and education, have a positive effect on these accounts. The classification accuracy of financial literacy towards AA, SA, and CA is 94.1%, 80.3%, and 95.4%, respectively. For age, the accuracy is 72.4% for AA, 81.6% for SA, and 67.1% for CA. For income, the accuracy is 89.5% for AA, 85.5% for SA, and 96.1% for CA. For education, the accuracy is 88.2% for AA, 78.3% for SA, and 94.7% for CA. Considering this evidence, businesswomen must have the financial knowledge to choose access, savings, and credit accounts to sustain and grow their business scope. For this purpose, central and local government support is still vital to assist them. © 2024 Conscientia Beam. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Higher Education Institutions play a role in poverty reduction by implementing community extension programs focusing on capacity building and entrepreneurship training. Cebu Technological University programs offer these programs through various skills training to its targeted beneficiaries. This study aims to assess the community extension Micro-, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) entrepreneurial activities concerning poverty reduction. The research participants are beneficiaries of community extension programs that primarily focus on capacity building and entrepreneurship training, and they eventually become entrepreneurs. Method: Using a cross-sectional survey, 172 valid responses were analyzed, with entrepreneurship education (EE), budgeting financial literacy (BFL), access to credit facilities (ACF), and entrepreneurial performance (EP) as predictors of poverty reduction (PR). Results from Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) generate insights from the seven hypothesized paths of the proposed model. Results and discussion: Findings revealed that entrepreneurship education (β = 0.258, p < 0.05), budgeting financial literacy (β = 0.147, p < 0.05), and access to credit facilities (β = 0.541, p < 0.001) help reduce poverty. However, no significant relationship was found between entrepreneurial performance and poverty reduction (β = 0.132, ns) whose cause may be directly pointed to the pandemic's significant impact on MSME's entrepreneurial activities. Conclusion: This study confirms the importance of entrepreneurship education, budgeting, financial literacy, and credit access in promoting entrepreneurial success and reducing poverty.

AB  - This study examines the impact of digital financial inclusion (DFI) on household entrepreneurship and the role of the traditional finance system (TFS). The results show that a 1% increase in DFI increases entrepreneurship by 0.264%. Improved willingness to borrow and financial literacy enhance DFI's effect. DFI and TFS have a willingness to borrow competitive relationship but a financial literacy synergistic relationship. The DFI-TFS relationship exhibits heterogeneity based on the rural–urban divide, bank types, and entrepreneurial motivations. These findings offer insights into the interplay between DFI and TFS in promoting household entrepreneurship. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Women's financial inclusion has become a global research agenda, and past studies provide mixed evidence on the determinants of financial inclusion among women entrepreneurs across the globe. However, the impact of digital financial literacy on women's financial inclusion has seldom been addressed in the past literature. Design/methodology/approach: The authors perform a cross-sectional analysis of 144 countries using the World Bank Global Findex Database. Findings: This study’s probabilistic regression results indicate that women entrepreneurs with a higher degree of digital financial literacy are more likely to engage in formal banking channels. Practical implications: The study findings have practical implications in terms of allowing regulators and banks to draw effective policies to attract women customers. Lack of effective regulatory intervention could lead to women exploring financial crimes, such as money laundering, due to their lack of involvement with the formal banking channel. Originality/value: The authors explore the impact of digital financial literacy on women's financial inclusion. Such evidence is rare in the existing literature.

AB  - Entrepreneurship is vital for economic growth and employment creation. This study aimed to examine the role of financial literacy and self-motivation in influencing entrepreneurial interest and self-efficacy among university students. A questionnaire was distributed to 92 final-year undergraduate students at a university in Indonesia. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling partial least squares (SEM-PLS). The results showed that financial literacy and self-motivation positively influenced students’ self-efficacy and entrepreneurial interest. Additionally, self-efficacy mediated the relationships between financial literacy, self-motivation, and entrepreneurial interest. The findings imply that universities should focus on enhancing financial literacy, self-motivation, and self-belief to equip students with the attitudes and skills necessary for entrepreneurship. This study contributes valuable insights into fostering student entrepreneurship by highlighting key antecedents of entrepreneurial intentions. © 2024, Success Culture Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Entrepreneurs manage the capital structure of their start-ups to align the assumption of financial risk with their risk appetite. We focus on the ways in which management control systems (MCS), categorized as financial and non-financial MCS, serve as determinants of financial leverage in start-ups. Of particular interest is the influence of entrepreneurs' financial literacy on this relationship. We test these associations on a sample of business-incubated start-ups by combining survey and archival data. Our results show that financial MCS are negatively associated with financial leverage, unlike non-financial MCS, which are positively related. Entrepreneurs’ financial literacy mitigates the impact of these associations. Overall, our aim is to shed light on how start-ups navigate the trade-off between taking risks and controlling their operations. In addition, we add to the growing literature on the adjustment of financial leverage and the role of MCS and financial literacy in managing such leverage. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This paper presents empirical evidence suggesting that financial literacy moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship between the amount of qualitative business information provided and the success of an equity crowdfunding campaign. Drawing on a sample of 807 equity offerings posted on 26 platforms operating in 6 Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Cyprus, France, Israel, Italy, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates), the findings indicate that higher levels of financial literacy amplify the positive effect of more comprehensive qualitative business information. However, once a qualitative business information threshold is crossed, financial literacy results related to observed negative returns are even more substantial. These results, rooted into the signalling and information overload theoretical frameworks, offer valuable insights for entrepreneurs, platform administrators, investors and policymakers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

The poor performance of women entrepreneurs on the Financial Literacy Score (FLS) was noticed. A significant gap was observed between the information about the financial system and access to their instruments. The study suggested developing financial literacy through induction programs and awareness camps among local entrepreneurs.

AB  - This article presents the results of the financial literacy assessment of young Mexican students between the ages of 17 and 24 enrolled in public and private institutions in five Mexican cities. This study’s objective was to approach the financial knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes of young Mexicans through focus groups and questionnaires to identify their perceptions of complex thinking and its use for financial products and services. The most relevant findings suggest that (a) most of the young participants in the study use banking services through their parents, (b) there are significant gender differences in financial knowledge and behaviors, (c) critical thinking significantly and positively correlates with financial behaviors and attitudes, and (d) the level of critical thinking predicts financial behavior. There is a need to develop women’s critical thinking to discern between the financial behavior they socially imitate and their capabilities to become more involved in financial issues, thus decreasing the gender gap. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This article examines the relationship between financial literacy and business interruption (BI) insurance among Italian entrepreneurs. Following an increase in unexpected shocks, such as COVID-19 and geopolitical conflicts, a high level of BI risk is expected to persist, especially among small firms, which play a key role in the Italian economy. Using a Bank of Italy 2021 survey of 1998 non-financial firms with fewer than 10 employees, we show a significant positive association between the level of the entrepreneur’s financial literacy and the purchase of BI insurance. Our results highlight the key role of financial literacy in shaping risk management strategies and are robust to different model specifications, also addressing endogeneity concerns. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: As good as existing measurements of entrepreneurial potential (EP) may appear in the literature, they are fragmented, suffer from the lack of theory integration and clarity, are inadequately specified and assessed and the dimensions are unordered by importance. These limitations of EP metrics have hindered entrepreneurial practice and theory advancement. There is a risk of atomistic evolution of the topic among “siloed” scholars and room for repetitions without real progress. The purpose of this paper was to take stock of existing measurements from which the authors developed a new instrument that is brief and inclusive. Design/methodology/approach: The authors followed several steps to develop and validate the new instrument, including construct domain name specification, literature review, structured interviews with entrepreneurs, face validation by experts, semantic validation and statistical validation after two waves of data collected on employee and entrepreneur samples. Findings: A clear operational definition of EP is proposed and serves as a starting point towards a unified EP theory. The new EP instrument is made up of 34 items classified into seven dimensions, which in order of importance are proactive innovativeness, management skill, calculated risk-taking, social skill, financial literacy, entrepreneurial competencies prone to cognitive and heuristic biases and bricolage. The authors provide evidence for reliability and validity of the new instrument. Research limitations/implications: Although a model is not the model, the authors discuss several ways in which the new measurement model can be used by different stakeholders to promote entrepreneurship. Originality/value: The authors discuss the domain representativeness of the new scale and argue that the literature can meaningfully benefit from a non-fuzzy approach to what makes the EP of an individual. By developing a new EP instrument, the authors set an important pre-condition for advancing entrepreneurial theory and practice. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The complexity of finances and access to financial markets is one of the main challenges facing an entrepreneur. However, not many studies examine the effect of financial skills on entrepreneurial intentions. Our research describes venture intentions, considering motivations, contextual factors and personal traits in different clusters, based on the strong sense of entrepreneurial self-efficacy and the levels of financial literacy and numeracy skills. Results demonstrate that financial and numeracy skills and self-efficacy shape different profiles of potential entrepreneurs. The study shows that social motivations exert a favourable impact on entrepreneurial intentions only for those who firmly believe in their abilities or have high financial and numeracy skills. For those without outstanding skills or high self-efficacy, contextual factors play a key role in the decision to launch a new venture. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - The owner of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) is responsible for managing their business finances. This research aims to determine the influence of financial literacy and financial attitude on the financial management behavior of MSMEs. The subject of this study was MSMEs entrepreneurs who joined the Group of Preman Super. A total is 44 people who are in the Malang area. The analysis test tool used is SmartPLS Version 3 analysis with SEM (Structural Equation Model) analysis method, with the inner and outer model method. After tabulating the data, the results showed that the financial management behavior of female MSMEs paguyuban Preman Super is still relatively low. This can be influenced by not understanding financial concepts and financial products and insufficient access to financial management knowledge. MSMEs owners still lack complete willingness and responsibility for their financial condition. As the MSME business actress (housewives) of Independent Women Source of Change (Group of Preman Super), they involve their feelings in making financial decisions for their business. © 2022, Auricle Global Society of Education and Research.

AB  - Scholars have been and will likely remain interested in the study of entrepreneurial intention because of its importance to the development of numerous countries. The literature on entrepreneurial intention has addressed a wide range of subjects, with particular emphasis on the factors that influence entrepreneurial intention. However, the vast majority of these studies were conducted overseas. Since this topic always focuses on the agriculture sector when determining entrepreneurial purpose, the study targeted that industry. The purpose of this study is to examine the aspirations of young Malaysians to become international entrepreneurs. It especially aims to determine the relationship between each component of financial literacy (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) and technological adoption, as well as the effect of technological adoption on young people's ambitions to become international entrepreneurs. The study's conclusions demonstrated that financial literacy (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control) and youth international entrepreneur intention were mediated by technology adoption. The study's findings contribute to the body of knowledge and support the executive branch and other decision-makers' creation of policies and programs. © Authors retain all copyrights.

AB  - The topic of women's financial inclusion has gained international attention, and prior research has shown conflicting results about the factors that influence financial inclusion among Rural Women Entrepreneurs (RWE) worldwide. Nonetheless, previous research has seldom examined how women's financial inclusion is impacted by digital financial literacy and Digital Libraries (DLs). An individual with financial literacy is equipped with the information and abilities needed to make wise business choices. The ability of business owners to get the capital they need has a beneficial impact on the expansion of the national economy. Making sure vulnerable populations, including low-income RWEs, have affordable access to suitable financial goods and services is known as financial inclusion. The geographical region under investigation was the southern part of India. The participants in the study were 499 RWE from five different states (Tamilnadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andra Pradesh and Telangana). A total of 259 respondents who used Digital Financial Goods & Services (DFG & S) using DLs and 240 respondents who did not utilize financial services took part in the survey. The statistical analysis compares the revenue of individuals who use DFG&S through DLs and those who do not use DFG & S. The annual savings exhibit a substantial disparity, shown by a T-ratio of 2.684 and a p-value of 0.015, which suggests a noteworthy difference at a significance level of 1.5%. Results indicate that those who answer save more money each year than those who do not react. On the other hand, the wealth parameter exhibits a T-ratio of 1.987 and a p-value of 0.123, indicating no statistically significant wealth disparity between the two respondent groups. © The Research Publication, www.trp.org.in.

AB  - Purpose: In a country that is marred by an excessively high unemployment rate, there is a need for policymakers to prioritise entrepreneurship in South Africa. The study aims to explore the determinants of self-employment among the youth in South Africa and in the process answer the following question: Who are the self-employed youths in South Africa? Design/methodology/approach: Different potential predictors of self-employment empirically used in the literature were used in this study. A probit regression model was used with the binary self-employment variable as the dependent variable and a host of independent variables. A nationally representative survey consisting of youths was used in the analysis. Findings: The findings show that financial literacy increases the odds of being self-employed. Secondly, the odds of being self-employed increase with age as mature people are expected to have gathered enough networks and wisdom over the years. Thirdly, being male decreases the odds of being self-employed. When it comes to education, the only category that statistically increases the odds of being self-employed compared with no schooling is the tertiary level of education. The other educational levels are all statistically insignificant. From a policy perspective, the government should promote self-employment by investing in financial literacy as well as increasing access to tertiary education among disadvantaged groups. Originality/value: The study is one of the first, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, to examine the characteristics of the self-employed using a nationally representative survey in South Africa. © 2023, Marifa Muchemwa and Clifford Odimegwu.

AB  - Purpose: Present study investigated the influence of female descendent entrepreneur's self-compassion on the perceived succession success of small-family businesses (S-FB) with the mediating mechanism of financial literacy. Design/methodology/approach: The primary data was collected from 319 female descendent entrepreneurs who were designated as chairwomen, and managing director positions in their retails sector S-FBs. The purposive sampling technique was used to collect the data. The provided hypotheses are tested using the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. This study followed multiple regression analyses to see the influence of self-compassion (mindfulness, self-isolation, self-judgment and over-identification) on financial literacy and perceived succession success. Findings: The results reveal that female descendent entrepreneurs mindfulness and over-identification significantly increase but self-isolation decreases the likelihood of successful succession transition. Moreover, female descendent entrepreneur's financial literacy increases mindfulness and overidentification while it decreases self-isolation and improves the likelihood of succession success. However, financial literacy does not influence self-judgmental traits and perceived succession success. Practical implications: This study highlights a vital issue, how the financial literacy of female descendent entrepreneurs manages their self-compassion and increases the likelihood of succession success. In addition, it covers a research gap and helps the S-FBs to improve their survival rate by focusing on the descendent entrepreneur's self-compassion and financial literacy. Originality/value: This study contributes to the body of knowledge by emphasizing predictors that influence the successful succession transition to subsequent generations. This study determines the influence of self-compassion of female descendent entrepreneurs on perceived succession success and financial literacy as a mediator by using the self-control theory. The study can be useful to family business consultants, policymakers and family businesses. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The term “i-FinTech” refers to businesses or entrepreneurs that integrate modern, Shariah-compliant technologies with financial services. Nevertheless, MSMEs are typically having lack internal knowledge or poor management, incompetent entrepreneurs, and limited financial resources. The purpose of this research is to analyse if financial literacy elements affect i-FinTech adoption and, in turn, promote sustainable entrepreneurship among Bumiputera SMEs in Selangor, Malaysia. A convenience sample strategy was used to disseminate 1,394 surveys to the Bumiputera entrepreneurs, utilizing a quantitative approach. PLS-SEM and mediation analysis are used to analyse the data. The findings indicate that financial literacy and digital financial literacy have a favorable and significant impact on the adoption of i-Fintech. On the other hand, the adoption of i-Fintech is adversely affected by financial management behavior. Furthermore, this study shows that the relationship between financial literacy and digital financial literacy towards sustainable entrepreneurship is mediated in a complimentary way by the adoption of i-FinTech. This result indicates that Bumiputera business owners that are financially and digitally literate are more likely to use i-FinTech and ultimately make a substantial contribution to sustainable entrepreneurship. The results should improve knowledge of the dynamics between the potential of i-FinTech and sustainable entrepreneurship for researchers, regulators, entrepreneurs, and i-FinTech service providers. It is advised that MSMEs keep using i-FinTech to support their operations in order to minimise the effects of a downturn in the market and maintain seamless operations. © 2024, Econjournals.

AB  - Purpose: Women entrepreneurs contribute significantly to Asian economies. However, women in this region face an alarming array of barriers to entrepreneurship. This research study aims to examine the factors, i.e. government support, family social support, financial literacy and managerial skills, in building the entrepreneurial capacity of women entrepreneurs under the lens of the person–environment (P-E) fit theory. Furthermore, the study also examines the moderating effect of socio-cultural barriers in the said relationships. Design/methodology/approach: For the study, the data was collected from the owners of 311 women-owned manufacturing and services sector enterprises from the northern Indian community. Findings: Findings suggest that all the factors significantly affect the entrepreneurial capacity of women entrepreneurs, and the barriers work as a moderator between the relationships. Originality/value: Based on P-E fit theory, this unique research study proposes a model to test the role of factors such as government support, family social support, financial literacy and managerial skills in developing women entrepreneurs’ entrepreneurial capacity along with examining the moderating role of socio-cultural factors contributing to the entrepreneurial capacity of women. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Utilizing China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data in 2017, this study examines the influence of financial literacy on household commercial insurance engagement. Empirical findings reveal that higher financial literacy correlates with increased likelihood and expenditure on commercial insurance. Education level and trust in commercial insurance also significantly enhance market participation. The study also discovers that financial literacy interacts with entrepreneurship, positively affecting family insurance purchasing behaviors. Particularly, financial literacy more significantly promotes insurance purchases in less educated families and communities with lower purchasing rates. In conclusion, our research not only contributes to enriching the study on the real effects of financial literacy, but also provides policy guidelines for governments on enhancing household participation in commercial insurance markets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction. It remains a challenge for educational sides to confront the advancement of technology that has both challenges and opportunities in various sectors of human life. Since the matter of this theme, the studies on the impact of digital literacy and economic behaviour are insufficient. The lack of a broader understanding of the involvement of digital literacy in the economic and management literature with economic behaviour of students has motivated to perform a systematic literature review to identify and synthesise essential gaps in the literature. Despite there being several reviews in economic behaviour, it is not connected specifically to entrepreneurial literacy, and digital literacy. Most studies are taking a stance on investigating consumption behaviour or financial behaviour, as well as involving financial literacy as the major. Aim. This study aims to identify the interconnectedness between economic, entrepreneurial, and digital literacy and economic behaviour of students. Methodology and research methods. This study employed a systematic literature review of papers published in Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and ProQuest databases using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The use of PRISMA is beneficial in providing more detail results and diminishing any possibility biases. Results and scientific novelty. The results of the study indicate that economic, digital, and entrepreneurial literacy can have impact to economic behaviour of students. The findings show an increasing economic behaviour trend in recent years in Indonesia and some countries. Thus, the study also noted that economic and digital literacy had been confirmed as essential to predict economic behaviour in terms of consumptive and productive activities. Meanwhile, the role of entrepreneurial literacy is paid less attention among scholars in explaining economic behaviour of students. This result will offer to future scholar in this theme to investigate these variables using certain method and approach. Practical significance. The results of this study provide a practical suggestion for scholars in the field of economics and entrepreneurship to consider the variables listed in this study. In addition, the study review synthesises several gaps research in the education, economics, and management literature that present a basis for providing future research related to economic behaviour. © 2024 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being among businesspersons in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, México. The applied methodology includes confirmatory factor analysis and multiple linear regression models. Our results indicate that financial literacy is related to financial well-being directly through its financial behavior component and inversely through financial attitude. Moreover, financial knowledge was not significantly associated with it. Hence, we propose the following recommendations for businesspeople and entrepreneurs: becoming more involved in healthy financial inclusion and financial literacy practices and inspiring their transition from models focused solely on profits to others considering their self-realization and satisfaction. Its main limitations and implications are the scarcity of data to perform an analysis by industry, its geographical outreach, and its public policy repercussions. Its originality lies in analyzing financial well-being among businesspeople, a topic rarely studied in Mexico. Our conclusions impact the implementation of the financial inclusion policy in Mexico and, therefore, contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas.

AB  - Despite the significance of business succession in the family firm literature, few studies have paid attention to the role of financial constraints, a common feature of micro and small firms, in entrepreneurs’ succession intention. Using a nationally representative survey of micro and small firms in China, we find that a higher degree of financial constraints significantly strengthens the entrepreneur’s intention of passing the firm on to the next generation. Moreover, the effect of financial constraints works particularly for firms whose entrepreneurs possess lower levels of financial literacy and for firms in regions with less-developed financial markets. Our results still hold after addressing potential endogeneity problems and conducting a wide array of robustness checks. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The rapid growth of digital financial services especially during the COVID-19 outbreak, is a factor accelerating the use of online loan applications that inevitably require the knowledge of digital finance. This study used the behavior change theory and digital financial literacy to identify relevant and correlated variables to confirm positive motivational factors on digital financial skills and capability. Structure equation modeling (SEM) and path analysis were applied to find the correlation and confirm the proposed hypotheses presented. There were 400 samples of small entrepreneurs from different provinces, and online questionnaires were used for data collection. The findings showed that the knowledge and motivation variables were related and had a positive effect. It contributes to continuously building up the skills and capabilities of small entrepreneurs who need to develop their capabilities in digital financial literacy adequately in line with the changes in business and technology after the outbreak of COVID-19. This concept can apply to online loan policy for small entrepreneurs trained with motivating courses who accepted digital finance literacy's usefulness. © 2023

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine entrepreneurship in the context of future Finnish teachers’ readiness to teach 21st century (broad-based) competencies. Teachers’ self-efficacy in teaching entrepreneurial skills and financial matters is vital for their pupils to actively participate and flourish in future society. The study utilized survey data of future teachers’ expectancy-values in teaching seven broad-based competencies of the current national curriculum and their financial literacy. Future teachers expressed high interest in all competencies but reported the least self-efficacy and highest cost in teaching ICT as well as working life and entrepreneurship competencies. Teaching self-efficacy (TSE) in entrepreneurial competencies was predicted by subjective evaluations of financial capability and TSE in consumer skills. Teaching STEM subjects as well as male gender were related to better objective financial knowledge. We discuss the implications of observed financial capability, lack in self-efficacy, and high experienced cost of teaching these competencies. Support for future teachers’ readiness to teach working life skills, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy through phenomenon-based school subject collaboration, formal teacher training, and digital applications are emphasized. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper assesses the impact of an integrated skills training program given to youth aged 17–25-year-old living under the $2/day poverty line in the cocoa belt region of Ghana. Despite being a leading producer of cocoa and having a burgeoning youth population, it is estimated that the average age of a cocoa farmer in Ghana is greater than 50 years. To introduce young people to cocoa farming and address the potential barriers they face in order to do that; a multi-faceted skills training programme was designed with the ultimate aim of improving and diversifying youth livelihoods. The training had three key components: i) cocoa academies (which includes agricultural practices; life skills and financial literacy); ii) business incubators (including entrepreneurial training, networks, mentoring) and iii) supporting enabling environment (access to land and finance). Combining quasi-experimental methods Propensity Score Matching with Difference in Differences, we estimate the causal effect of the programme on agricultural outcomes (farming, agricultural practices), financial behaviour outcomes (saving practices, mobile banking) and livelihood outcomes (employment, income, poverty likelihood) one year after the completion of training. The results of the impact evaluation suggest that compared to the control group (youth non-participants), youths who participated in the training adopt better agricultural practices (26 percentage points (pp)), cultivate cocoa (24 pp), and are more likely to engage in farming (22 pp). We also find a 28.7% increase in income in the last seven days and hours worked by 12.4%. Youth also increase the use of banks for saving (16 pp), save using mobile money (6.7 pp), the use of Village Savings and Loan Associations (1.7 pp) and, in general, the use of mobile money for both sending and receiving transfers (10.6 pp). The sex-disaggregated sub-sample analysis provides other valuable insights on the intervention. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

There is a pressing need to foster financial literacy;, therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine particularly how Islamic financial literacy may enhance their businesses toward achieving financial sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quantitative methods. Three hundred (300) questionnaires were distributed to micro-entrepreneurs in three states in Malaysia, namely, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu. This study used the partial least squares (PLS) analysis using the SmartPLS 3.2. Findings: The study found that the most robust Islamic financial literacy factors are financial behavior, followed by financial knowledge and financial attitude.The outcome of Islamic financial literacy, which is financial sustainability, also demonstrates a positive and significant relationship. Social implications: All variables show a positive and significant relationship toward financial sustainability. Stated differently, micro-entrepreneurs are aware that understanding the basic concepts of Islamic finance may help them achieve long-term financial sustainability Originality/value: This study incorporates Islamic financial concepts into financial literacy while also assessing demographic aspects like years of business operation and education as moderators, which were not considered by previous studies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This research examined the gist of financial literacy on the medium entrepreneurs in Indonesia, impacting the retirement planning through some mediator and moderating variables. Implementing the prospect theory and theory of planned behavior to explore these interactions, a series of hypotheses were constructed, considering financial risk tolerance and saving behavior as mediator variables and herding behavior as moderator variables. The study examined partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) obtained by sampling data from 388 entrepreneurs of medium-scale in the Bekasi Regency, Indonesia. The study revealed (a) how financial literacy on retirement planning is serial mediated by financial risk tolerance and saving behavior, (b) herding behavior can strengthen financial literacy’s influence on retirement planning, and (c) saving behavior as a mediator does not influence the relationship between financial literacy and retirement planning. The study confirms how financial risk tolerance and herding behavior bridge a positive relationship between financial literacy and retirement planning. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Financial literacy is crucial to the growth and development of any enterprise. This study investigates the impact of microentrepreneurs’ demographic characteristics on financial literacy by breaking it down into three components: financial knowledge, financial behavior, and financial attitude. The study data were collected from 132 microentrepreneurs through a survey questionnaire using a snowball sampling technique. An ordinary least square regression was used to analyze how entrepreneurs’ demographic characteristics are related to financial knowledge, financial behavior, financial attitude, and financial literacy. The study revealed that being male, having higher education and more experience, and operating in urban areas have a significant impact on financial literacy and its three components. However, age was found to have no significant impact on financial literacy. This study will help in designing targeted strategies and specialized programs for entrepreneurs looking at the significant impact of their diverse characteristics on financial literacy. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Background: Community pharmacists play a vital role in the healthcare system, serving as accessible healthcare providers and entrepreneurs. To effectively manage community pharmacies, pharmacists must possess financial literacy and utilize appropriate financial indicators. However, studies addressing community pharmacists' awareness of financial indicator concepts are scarce. This study assesses the awareness of community pharmacists in Jordan regarding financial indicators. Methods: Employing a cross-sectional study design, we utilized a structured and validated questionnaire to collect data from 353 community pharmacy owners across Jordan. The questionnaire assessed pharmacists' awareness and utilization of financial indicators in pharmacy management. Descriptive statistics summarized demographic data, while analytical statistics examined associations between demographic factors and financial indicator awareness. Results: The study revealed varying levels of awareness among pharmacists regarding financial indicators, with younger pharmacists exhibiting higher awareness levels. Factors such as educational background and years of experience were found to influence awareness. Furthermore, pharmacists predominantly utilize profitability indicators to assess financial performance. Conclusion: The findings underscore the importance of enhancing pharmacists' financial literacy and integrating financial management principles into pharmacy education. Continuous professional development programs are essential to improve financial competence among pharmacists. This study provides valuable insights into the awareness of financial indicators among community pharmacists in Jordan, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts from policymakers, pharmacy faculties, and associations to enhance financial education and promote research in this critical area. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This paper explored the factors that impact the sustainability and growth of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) in Botswana. A self-administered structured questionnaire was used to survey 348 owners/managers of SMEs in the South Eastern District of Botswana. Descriptive and inferential statistics were generated from the gathered data using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Version 27.0). Findings revealed that entrepreneurial factors, firm-specific factors and exogenous factors impacted the growth and sustainability of manufacturing firms in Botswana. In addition, government policies and guidelines, innovation and creativity, human capital development, access to finance, financial management skills and managerial skills were also confirmed as significantly contributing to the growth and sustainability of manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises in Botswana. Key recommendations derived from these findings include the need for policymakers in the government of Botswana and private sector partners to upskill owners/managers of manufacturing enterprises on business planning, financial management, financial literacy, quality management, and market research skills. Furthermore, efforts should be accelerated to promote products manufactured in Botswana to regional and global markets. © 2024, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

AB  - Exploring the financial behavior traits amidst the unexpected financial challenges and the unparalleled rise in fintech, this study provides insight into the interplay of entrepreneur digital financial literacy (EDFL), entrepreneur financial competency (EFC), and entrepreneur financial skill (EFS) impacting entrepreneur financial decision-making (EFDM). Toward this goal, data were gathered from 223 active women entrepreneurs from India who have accounts in the social media platform. The three-step hierarchical regression analysis disclosed that an entrepreneur with sound EDFL, EFS, and EFC can significantly enhance strategic decision-making (EFDM). The research outcome reveals that EFDM is a consistent predictor of the financial performance of women-owned enterprises. In addition, the entrepreneur’s financial decision-making does not mediate the relationship between financial experience, financial competency, financial skill budgeting, and financial skill_acumen with financial performance. In contrast, partial mediation is observed between digital financial awareness, digital financial knowledge, and financial skill_analytics. The novel insight accounted for a significantly low level of experience in entrepreneurs’ utilization of digital platforms for payment, financing loans, and asset management. The outcome carries academic, regulatory, and managerial significance, recognizing the unique interaction; the cumulative efforts strengthen the capacity to address socio-economic challenges and translate them into gender-specific policy interventions and practices. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This study explores the impact of digitalization, literation, and innovation on the financial performance of Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) in Bojonegoro, East Java, Indonesia. Using a sample of 35 business owners, the research employs partial least squares structural equations modelling. The findings reveal a positive and significant relationship between innovation and MSMEs’ financial performance, emphasizing the crucial role of innovative practices. Additionally, business owners’ literacy levels positively influence innovation. Although digitalization shows a positive impact on innovation and financial performance, the lack of statistical significance calls for nuanced exploration. The study contributes to understanding the complex dynamics within MSMEs post-pandemic, emphasizing the importance of literation and innovation. The research offers practical insights for MSME owners on enhancing financial literacy and fostering an innovative culture within their businesses. Policymakers were also encouraged to allocate resources to facilitate financial training for business owners. Urban areas might employ varying pandemic response strategies depending on their economic circumstances, resulting in differences in interaction variables. Future studies should extend these findings to diverse urban settings to broaden our understanding of literation, innovation, and digitalization’s impact on MSME performance. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The term of economic behavior has been frequently discussed among scholars and academicians, primarily related the shifting of economic and financial activities. Understanding economic behavior will avoid students from debt traps and possibly enhance financial and overall well-being in students. This study aimed to conduct a systematic literature review on the relationship between financial literacy in family and economic behavior of university students. To perform the systematic review, this paper followed the guidelines of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) to reach a deeper understanding and result. This study formulated four research questions regarding the financial literacy in family and economic behavior of university students. The results of this literature review indicated that the financial literacy in family can be developed through various involvements, including financial socialization, habituation, exemplary, and discussion among family members. Meanwhile, the economic behavior of students is formed into three behaviors, covering consumption, entrepreneurship, and finance. The findings also confirmed that family financial literacy can drive the economic behavior of students. The results also noted that the government and educational policy supports are required to deal with changes in economic behavior of students by implementing some financial socialization programs at both formal and informal education levels. © Behavioral Science Research Institute

AB  - This paper empirically investigates the impact of digital transformation on the performance of rural household entrepreneurship. We find that digital transformation promotes rural household entrepreneurship performance. Financial literacy plays a role as a moderating variable between the two. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the facilitating effect of digital transformation on rural household entrepreneurship performance is more significant in the central and western regions. This paper enriches the research on digital transformation from a micro perspective, complements the relevant research on rural households, and explores the mechanism of digital transformation's impact on rural household entrepreneurship performance. © 2024

AB  - Orientation: Among the numerous factors affecting small and medium enterprises’ (SMEs) ability to access funding, financial literacy or the lack thereof continues to rank high. The below-average levels of financial literacy among entrepreneurs inevitably restrict their access to finance, thereby adding to the already soaring rate of small business failure. Research purpose: The main research objective of this article is to determine the underlying financial literacy-financial access relationship among SMEs in the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality in South Africa. Motivation of the study: Understanding the relationship between financial literacy and financial access among small businesses is imperative as they are key players in economic development. Empirical literature outlining this relationship is sparse. Therefore, the study made an original empirical contribution to the financial literacy-financial access nexus in the metropolitan. Research design, approach and method: A quantitative descriptive research design was followed. The survey method was used to gather data, where structured questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. The study considered a targeted population of 5609 registered SMEs in Ekurhuleni with a sample size of 384 prospective participants. A total of 310 responses were obtained from the owners and managers of SMEs in the municipality. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to compute all statitical analyses for the study. Descriptive statistics were used to establish the SMEs’ financial literacy and financial access relationship. Data were analysed using factor analysis, regression analysis and correlation analysis. Main findings: Entrepreneurs in Ekurhuleni were found to have a limited understanding of basic financial concepts implying low levels of financial knowledge. Additionally, the study established that financial access was significantly challenging for most SMEs. The findings further revealed a positive relationship between financial literacy and financial access. Practical managerial/ implications: The knowledge from this article may assist entrepreneurs and financial institutions in bridging the financial literacy gap, thereby increasing the likelihood of accessing funding by SMEs. It may also assist in influencing the development and implementation of micro and macroeconomics policies to raise financial literacy levels and leniency from financing sources towards SMEs. © 2023.

AB  - This article aims to determine the intervening strength of financial mindfulness between financial literacy and behavioural biases in women entrepreneurs. The literature has an enduring discussion regarding the profoundly unique financial behaviour of women. Financial literacy and behavioural biases constitute a recurrent research topic, yet how this nexus exists in the premise of women’s entrepreneurship is not well known. Building on this gap, we examined the impact of financial literacy on women entrepreneurs’ behavioural biases by focusing on financial mindfulness as a potential moderator. A random sample of 346 women entrepreneurs operating in Pakistan was analysed using structural equation modelling through AMOS 21. The results revealed a significant direct impact of financial literacy on reducing anchoring and herding bias; however, financial literacy was found to be unrelated to mental accounting bias. The moderation analysis further revealed interesting indirect impacts, such that financial literacy strongly reduced mental accounting and herding bias for financially mindful women. Nonetheless, financial mindfulness does not negatively catalyse the relationship between financial literacy and anchoring bias. By encompassing the concepts of financial literacy, mindfulness and behavioural biases, we offer a unique theoretical strand with practical implications for women entrepreneurs. We suggest new avenues for the longstanding dilemma related to the factors instigating suboptimal financial decision-making in women entrepreneurs in developing markets. © 2022 Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode.

AB  - Research background: Retirement planning is viewed as one of the cornerstones of long-term household financial security. The responsibility of retirement planning has now been shifted to the individual and is no longer the responsibility of the employer. Purpose: This paper examines the link between financial literacy and retirement planning among informal sector traders in the Randburg area of Johannesburg, South Africa. Research methodology: A questionnaire approach was used to collect data from 269 randomly selected informal sector respondents. The data was analysed using ordinal regression. Robustness tests were executed using the Wald test. Results: Findings reveal that financial literacy is linked to retirement planning, and especially with reference to informal sector workers. Additionally, education, income and the informal business sector were observed to have a positive and significant influence on retirement planning. Novelty: The paper contributes to both theoretical and practical discourses on retirement planning for informal sector entrepreneurs which has not received much attention. These results are important for policy makers in retirement planning as well as curriculum development.  © 2024 Rudo Gutura et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Previous studies on new venture digitalization have claimed that digitalization is becoming more important for new ventures’ survival. However, it is unclear how factors such as digital strategy, organization’s bricolage behaviour, financial literacy and organization’s IT capabilities can influence the adoption of new venture digitalization and affect small and medium enterprises’ (SMEs) specific business activities. This study is aimed at filling the gap in the literature by creating an understanding of how businesses can utilize their IT capabilities to combine resources towards achieving optimal new venture digitalization. Using gender and educational level as moderators, we examine the effect of organization’s IT capabilities, digital strategy, financial literacy and organization’s bricolage behaviour on new venture digitalization. We find that digital strategy, organizational bricolage behaviour and organization’s IT capabilities have a significant effect on new venture digitalization. Furthermore, digital transformation strengthens SMEs’ ability and flexibility to address main business issues. However, financial literacy has no significant effect on SME digitalization. Also, the gender and educational level of SME entrepreneurs seemed not to be influenced by financial literacy and the adoption of digitalization. These findings increase our understanding of how digital strategy, organization’s bricolage behaviour, financial literacy and organization’s IT capabilities can influence the adoption of new venture digitalization. © 2023 MDI.

AB  - This paper investigates the complex factors hindering entrepreneurial aspirations in Lebanon, focusing on the absence of a functional financial system and its impact on entrepreneurial intentions. Drawing on surveys conducted with 325 Lebanese participants across three generations, using ordinal regression, the research reveals crucial determinants of entrepreneurial intentions, emphasizing the roles of entrepreneurial attitude, the absence of banking sector services, optimism, risk propensity, and age. Positive attitudes and optimism correlate with stronger intentions; however, the weakened economic situation and lack of a functional financial system diminish this positive correlation. Demographic factors like gender and education do not significantly influence intentions. In addition, the study reveals differences in entrepreneurial intentions determinants across the three generations of X, Y, and Z. This study underscores the urgent need for financial system reforms in Lebanon to enhance stability while advocating for financial literacy programs and private sector initiatives to empower entrepreneurs and expand their businesses. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This paper analyzes the effects of the combination of two teaching methods on entrepreneurial intention in Tunisia. The developed model suggests that entrepreneurial intention depends on eight cognitive and non-cognitive variables; namely, financial literacy and entrepreneurial knowledge developed through a theoretically-oriented course, and teaching methods, creativity, managing ambiguity, entrepreneurial mindset, entrepreneurial attitude and core self-evaluation developed through a practically-oriented course. The authors use structural equation modeling to test the proposed model, based on a sample of 92 undergraduate management students in the Faculty of Economics and Management of Tunis, Tunisia. The results demonstrate that creativity is a good predictor of students’ entrepreneurial intention. Creativity can be developed by entrepreneurial teachers who enhance students’ ambiguity management and improve their core self-evaluation. The results also show that financial literacy positively influences entrepreneurial knowledge and managing ambiguity. Entrepreneurial knowledge positively influences entrepreneurial mindset and core self-evaluation. The management students’ entrepreneurial mindset positively influences their entrepreneurial attitude, which develops their core self-evaluation. Because the respondents were all studying at the same faculty, the results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to broaden the field of investigation and to include in their studies students from other institutions. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Financial literacy is the significant human capital factor affecting people's ability to obtain financial services. Evaluating the relationship between financial literacy and relative poverty is of great significance to poverty reduction. This study investigated the impacts of financial literacy on relative poverty from the perspective of poverty psychology and market participation using data from the 2017, 2019 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). The empirical findings showed that financial literacy can alleviate relative household poverty through household participation in entrepreneurial activities, commercial insurance participation and the choice of lending channels. Financial literacy has significant poverty reduction effect on households of continuous operation, reduces the likelihood of exiting operation. Further discussion showed that the poverty reduction effect of financial literacy is more pronounced among households with higher levels of financial literacy, under the age of sixty, low levels of indebtedness and in the eastern region. Our study provides empirical evidence for encouraging market participation and promoting financial literacy and provide valuable recommendations for the policymaker to improve poverty reduction effect in the developing country context.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on small businesses, significantly influencing entrepreneurial aspirations and presenting numerous challenges. This calls for additional research into perceptions, intentions, and the challenges faced in this context. This study aims to explore the comprehension of key entrepreneurial concepts among business students in the post-pandemic era. The paper presents an empirical study which employs qualitative in-depth interviews with 34 undergraduate business students from one public university in the Midwest of the United States. The findings reveal a complex view of entrepreneurship that extends beyond traditional business creation, encompassing elements of social innovation and personal fulfillment. Students displayed a generally positive attitude towards entrepreneurship, influenced strongly by their involvement in practical entrepreneurship-related activities and their familial backgrounds. However, they also identified significant barriers, including financial constraints, fear of failure, and a lack of practical experience, which hinder their intentions to pursue entrepreneurial ventures. The study underscores the importance of entrepreneurship education programs incorporating more comprehensive practical experiences, enhancing financial literacy, and providing psychological support to overcome these challenges. These insights contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to effectively support and prepare aspiring entrepreneurs in a changing educational landscape. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - Purpose: The study focused on the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs at the Galerías Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia, from 2019 to 2023. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the paper is empirical-analytical, focusing on the tangible and unique aspects of reality that can be fragmented for measurement. This approach privileges the use of data from the study population’s experience, which is treated analytically through statistics to establish frequencies and correlations between variables. The research involved a structured questionnaire based on bibliographic references and considering the operational framework of the variables, which underwent expert review, necessary adjustments, a pilot test and subsequent validation in 2019 and 2023. The reliability of the instrument was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, ensuring a reliable indicator when equal to or greater than 0.7 in each analysis period. This methodology aimed to identify practices and how the financial profile influences short term. Findings: The findings from the survey conducted with the microentrepreneurs at Galerías Shopping Center reveal several significant connections to the theoretical framework. The study revealed that many microentrepreneurs relied on their personal funds for business financing, indicating a limited understanding of financial principles. Additionally, a significant portion of microentrepreneurs mitigated investment risk by securing loans from financial institutions, yet none utilized government subsidies like entrepreneurship loans, pointing to a lack of advice. The findings underscore the importance of financial education and suitable financial services for business development. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this study is the lack of detailed data on the financial structure of microentrepreneurs' businesses, as well as specific information on interest rates and the terms and conditions of the microcredit used. These limitations may affect the generalization of the results and the comprehensive understanding of the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs. Future research could include a larger sample size and more accurate data on the financial structure of businesses, as well as a detailed investigation of interest rates and terms and conditions of microcredit, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the financial impacts for microentrepreneurs. Practical implications: The findings of this study have practical implications for microentrepreneurs in the Galerías Shopping Center. The research emphasizes the need for improved financial knowledge, accounting practices and debt management among microentrepreneurs. It also highlights the importance of financial education and access to suitable financial services for business development. The study’s insights can guide the development of training programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing financial literacy and financial management among microentrepreneurs, leading to more informed decision-making and improved financial outcomes. Social implications: From a social perspective, this research contributes to promoting economic development and financial inclusion. By addressing the mismanagement of microcredit by microentrepreneurs and providing insights into their short-term finances, the study aims to foster economic empowerment and sustainable development within communities. The findings underscore the significance of microfinance in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. The research emphasizes the importance of equitable access to financial services, which can contribute to narrowing the gap between the financially excluded population and the conventional financial system. Originality/value: This research adds originality and value to the academic community by addressing the incidence of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs in the specific context of the Galerías Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia. By characterizing the financial profile of microentrepreneurs, establishing the relationship between microcredit characteristics and the financial profile and proposing an action plan, the study provides valuable insights for decision-making in both the academic and microfinance fields. The research contributes to the existing literature on microfinance and financial inclusion, offering a unique perspective and potential solutions for optimizing the use of microcredit-funded resources by microentrepreneurs. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Farmland mortgage financing policy has been actively carried out and intertwined with mass entrepreneurship strategy in China in recent years. Using survey data of 1947 rural households in pilot counties of farmland mortgage loans (FMLs), we contribute to the literature by examining the impact of financial literacy on rural households’ entrepreneurship with considering the heterogeneity between agricultural and non-agricultural entrepreneurship and exploring how financial literacy affects entrepreneurship through FMLs. The results show that financial literacy has a significant and positive impact on both rural households’ agricultural and non-agricultural entrepreneurship. Moreover, households with higher level of financial literacy show a higher probability in the application for and approval of more FMLs. This study provides strong evidence that the impact of financial literacy on farm households’ agricultural entrepreneurship is partially mediated by FMLs, while that impact on their non-agricultural entrepreneurship is partially suppressed by FMLs. We further find that financial literacy can also increase rural households’ entrepreneurial income through their approval of FMLs. These findings suggest that systematical financial literacy training programs are needed to popularize FML products and services and facilitate rural households’ entrepreneurship. © 2024

AB  - How financial literacy (FL) can contribute to both digital entrepreneurship (DE) willingness and behavior has become a widely concerned and controversial topic among scholars and practitioners, one that is particularly relevant for bottom of pyramid (BOP) entrepreneurs. However, existing literature has not established a systematic theoretical framework for this issue, and its internal mechanism has not been thoroughly revealed. Hence, based on behavioral finance theory and digital business-related literature, we construct a multi-layer linear and mediated-moderation model that relates latent variables of FL, financial inclusion (FI), digital literacy (DL), and DE. A total of 664 villagers carrying out DE are the sample from China, and the empirical results mainly reveal the following: FL significantly improves the DE willingness and behavior, and the sense of FI plays a partial mediating role between FL and DE willingness and behavior. DL is a crucial influencing factor that moderates a positive effect between FL and DE willingness and behavior. Moreover, DL plays a mediated-moderating role. By contrast, FL in poverty-stricken counties (PSC) has a more substantial influence on DE than that in non-poverty-stricken counties (NPSC). If the family background (social capital) is superior (excellent), and the resources are abundant, then the influence of FL on DE will be stronger. This research contributes to the theories and practices related to FL, DE, FI, and DL. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between financial literacy and the leverage of small firms, specifically of the legal forms, sole proprietorships, and partnerships. Using a cross-section of 73,302 firms in 22 countries, we find that the leverage of small firms is negatively associated with financial literacy. Further, we explore the role of financial development, bankruptcy and transaction costs, and information asymmetry, in moderating the relationship. We find that the negative relationship is less pronounced in countries with lower financial development, high bankruptcy and transaction costs, and high information asymmetry environments, respectively. We contribute to the understanding of small firms' leverage and the literature on financial literacy, SMEs, finance, and entrepreneurship. This study offers policy implications for economies that promote SMEs for entrepreneurship training and development. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Financing capital investments and working capital have been the key challenges for small businesses during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. Excessive indebtedness can increase the fragility of firms, particularly during times of uncertainty. While there are several programs globally that target entrepreneurs' financial literacy, most of them do not take into consideration entrepreneurs' financial resilience during and after crisis times such as pandemics. The objective of this paper is to discuss the status of financial literacy programs targeting entrepreneurs. This paper conducts a review of the relevant literature to establish the initial understanding and then generates a framework consisting of entrepreneurs' financial literacy along with its components. This is done by carrying out qualitative content analysis of the various financial literacy initiatives targeting entrepreneurs in twenty countries globally to understand their target segments, scope, initiating organisations and limitations. The paper then suggests a framework for entrepreneurs' financial education that takes into consideration financial resilience during and after crisis situations in general and pandemics in particular. © 2023 Malaysian Economic Association.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of private and public initiatives (financial literacy, entrepreneurship, remote work and government aid) on individual job loss and decrease in income during the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used an unbalanced panel data analysis with the National Household Survey for 2019–2020. The hypotheses are tested with a probit panel data model since the dependent variables are binary. Findings: The study findings indicate that financial preparedness reduced the probability of having a decrease in income, but only to informal workers in metropolitan Lima. Furthermore, entrepreneurship helped mainly female informal workers to reduce their probability of becoming unemployed in metropolitan Lima. Besides, the implementation of remote work as a substitute of face-to-face work was not enough to avoid the decrease in income in the case of informal workers and it was only effective to avoid unemployment in the case of formal workers in metropolitan Lima. Finally, public aid proved to be instrumental in mitigating the decrease in income, but only to informal workers in Metropolitan Lima. Research limitations/implications: The study results only apply for the first year of the pandemic. Practical implications: Policymakers should focus on increasing the financial preparedness of informal workers, especially in provinces. Social implications: Policymakers must expand unemployment benefits, and design public aid programs targeting informal workers in provinces. Originality/value: This is the first study that analyses the impact of private and public initiatives on the decrease in income and unemployment situation of Peruvian individuals during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2023, Samuel Arturo Mongrut, Vivian Cruz and Daniela Pacussich.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate whether the level of financial literacy differs significantly among entrepreneurs in three European countries: Italy, Spain, and the UK. Moreover, I analyze whether financial literacy fosters or hinders entrepreneurial resilience and success. I find that the level of basic financial literacy is significantly lower among entrepreneurs in the UK. I provide an explanation based on job opportunities arguing that basic financial literacy increases the chances of survival of a business, whereas advanced financial literacy decreases it. I propose a taxonomy linking levels of financial literacy with different approaches to financial management. I conclude that a “conservative” approach to financial management (cash based, debt-averse and diversified) is more likely to guarantee survival even if it is not necessarily the best way to maximize firm value. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The technological revolution we have been witnessing over the last 30 years is bringing about important changes in business management, specifically in the conception, development, and management of its financial aspects. How to face these challenges is a particularly critical question for individual entrepreneurs who have to assume a much greater responsibility for decisions than in other corporate environments. In this sense, it is very important to understand the financial capabilities and skills and their limitations of this type of entrepreneurship, which is so important for the renewal and extension of the business community in any developed economy. Based on an extensive official survey of this type of entrepreneurship, this research proposes a logistic regression modeling, in order to find out the level of financial knowledge of this business group. One of the findings of this research is that individual entrepreneurs have a higher level of financial knowledge than salaried workers, with a higher qualification in this respect in the case of individual entrepreneurs with employees. This study analyses the link between individual entrepreneurs or self-employed workers – with or without employees – and financial literacy. In addition, we investigated the relationship between this group with their socio-demographic characteristics, financial product holdings, financial planning, and financial fragility. Different binary logistic regression models with maximum likelihood were estimated using a sample of individual entrepreneurs and self-employed workers from the Survey of Financial Competences database conducted in Spain to achieve this. The results of the study show that individuals who choose to be individual entrepreneurs or self-employed, and in particular those with hired workers, had a higher level of financial literacy than salaried workers. Moreover, it was confirmed that financial literacy complements the explanatory power of the other variables analyzed with respect to sole proprietors without employees, although not to a significant degree. The limitations of this work are due to the use of data from the Financial Skills Survey, so some dichotomous variables offer very generic information. In addition, the database is cross-sectional and we cannot analyze variations between different periods. No research before had applied the relationships between the behavior of individual entrepreneurs, with and without employees, and financial competencies using logistic functions and on the basis of a rigorous and comprehensive formal questionnaire. The conclusions provide a valuable perspective for developing training programs for this type of human capital aimed at raising the financial skills of individual entrepreneurs to improve personal and business management. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the relationship between entrepreneurial motivation and pharmapreneurial intention among pharmacists in Jordan.The authors also assessed the moderating effect of gender and the COVID-19 pandemic on the relationship between these two variables. Design/methodology/approach: This study is a quantitative study targeting pharmacists and using a nonprobability sample. A structured questionnaire was distributed through official channels to the entire population of registered pharmacists in Jordan. SmartPLS 3 was used for carrying an advanced structural equation model analysis, and SPSS 26 for the descriptive statistics. Findings: The three entrepreneurial motivation variables (behavioral control [BC], risk tolerance and desirability of self-employment) affected pharmapreneurial intention, with BC contributing more to pharmapreneurial intention among pharmacists in Jordan than the other variables examined. On the other hand, gender and COVID-19 did not moderate this relationship. Research limitations/implications: The authors find that entrepreneurial motivation affects pharmapreneurial intention. Consequently, the authors provide insights to policymakers and educators regarding dovetailing the recent financial literacy programs implemented in Jordanian schools with medical education in Jordan to better motivate the formation of pharmapreneurial intention. Practical implications: Policymakers and educators should be dovetailing the recent financial literacy programs implemented in Jordanian schools with medical education in Jordan to better motivate the formation of pharmapreneurial intention. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to examine pharmapreneurship in Jordan. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Entrepreneurship has become a central issue in an effort to improve the nation’s economic welfare. Several previous studies agree that the ideal country is one that has an entrepreneurial contribution of at least 4% of its total population. However, when compared with other countries, Indonesia’s entrepreneurial contribution is currently still low because it has only reached an entrepreneurial ratio of 3.47%. One of the causes of this low contribution is the lack of effective entrepreneurship education. Some empirical evidence has not been able to explain how entrepreneurship education is able to prepare generation Z to become entrepreneurs through various new literacies. This research aims to investigate the influence of entrepreneurship education on the entrepreneurial readiness of generation Z students, which is moderated by digital business literacy and financial literacy. This research was conducted using a quantitative approach and involved 700 students in Makassar City, Indonesia. The data analysis technique used is partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis. Research findings show that entrepreneurship education plays an important role in the entrepreneurial readiness of generation Z students, which is strengthened by digital business literacy and financial literacy. The findings of this research can help expand and develop concepts related to digital business literacy and financial literacy in the context of entrepreneurship education in higher education, so that, by implication, this research provides a valuable contribution to entrepreneurship education, which paves the way for further research regarding entrepreneurial readiness in the context of diverse higher education through various other new literacies. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This study uses China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data from 2010 to 2018 to empirically investigate the interplay between digital technology access, labor market behavior, and income inequality in rural China. The following salient conclusions are derived. Digital technology access has a substantial negative influence on individual income inequality in rural China, with a more pronounced inhibitory effect on inequality among low-income groups, males, middle and higher professional classes, and younger cohorts. Mechanism analysis suggests that digital technology access significantly impacts a range of rural labor practices, including increasing the frequency of digital technology use among rural inhabitants, decreasing credit costs, enhancing entrepreneurial activities, and boosting rural labor mobility. Based on these findings, this study proposes accelerating digital infrastructure development in rural regions, improving digital and financial literacy among rural residents, and refining inclusive digital financial services to facilitate more stable and sustainable progress to promote common prosperity. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Entrepreneurship has been viewed as a catalyst for economic growth because it creates jobs and offers solutions to social issues. The government is trying to make entrepreneurship popularized among the public, especially in students in universities. This analysis aims to ascertain how financial behavior and literacy, particularly among accounting students who are the sample of this study at West Java universities, affect entrepreneurial motivation. In addition, this research also examined the level of financial literacy and the level of financial behavior in accounting students in West Java, Indonesia. This research employs a quantitative approach and the data were collected using a survey questionnaire. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) method were used to analyze data of 252 respondents of accounting students from universities in West Java, Indonesia. The study discovered a significant positive association between financial literacy and accounting students’ financial behavior and their willingness to start their own business. The research also assessed the degree of financial literacy and financial behavior among participants who achieved a relatively strong overall outcome, along with the level of drive for entrepreneurship among respondents with a similarly elevated average performance. This research contributes to educators and educational institutions that it is very important to design an integrated educational curriculum to strengthen the entrepreneurial motivation of accounting students who are the sample of this study at West Java universities in Indonesia. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Under the backdrop of economic globalization and the digital economy, entrepreneurial behavior has emerged not only as a focal point of management research but also as an urgent topic within the domain of family finance. This paper scrutinizes the ramifications of financial literacy on household entrepreneurial behavior utilizing data from China’s sample of the China Household Finance Survey spanning the years 2015 and 2017. Employing the ordered Probit model, we pursue our research objectives. Our findings suggest that financial literacy exerts immediate, persistent, and evolving positive effects on households’ engagement in entrepreneurial activities and their proclivity toward entrepreneurship. Through the mitigation of endogeneity in the regression model, the outcomes of the two-stage regression corroborate the primary regression results. An examination of heterogeneity unveils noteworthy disparities between urban and rural areas, as well as gender discrepancies, in how financial literacy influences household entrepreneurial behavior. Furthermore, this study validates three potential pathways—namely income, social network, and risk attitude channels—demonstrating that financial literacy significantly augments household income, expands social networks, and enhances risk attitudes. Moreover, through supplementary analysis, we ascertain that financial education amplifies the impact of financial literacy on entrepreneurial behavior. Our study contributes to the enrichment of human capital theory and modern entrepreneurship theory. It advocates for robust efforts by governments and financial institutions to widely disseminate financial knowledge and foster family entrepreneurship, thereby fostering the robust and stable operation of both the global financial market and the job market. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Developing financial literacy is a crucial part of entrepreneurship. It can aid aspiring entrepreneurs to learn how to analyze market trends, formulate business plans, conduct cost accounting activities, and navigate fiscal risks in their businesses. Therefore, we investigated the most recent dataset on rural residents in China to determine the effects of financial literacy on their entrepreneurial behaviors. Our observations reveal that individuals with high financial literacy, that is, those who have attained advanced financial knowledge, are more likely to start a business than those with low financial literacy. We employed instrumental variable analysis to mitigate the endogeneity of financial literacy. Results show a causal relationship between Chinese rural residents’ financial literacy and entrepreneurship. Finally, we demonstrate that the aggressive risk attitudes of rural families magnify the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurship. © 2024

AB  - This study examines the effect of digital financial inclusion on relative poverty among urban households in China. Based on the data of the China Family Panel Studies and the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China, using the weak relative poverty line to identify relative poverty among urban households, we use a probit model, a mediating effect model, and an instrumental variable method to conduct empirical research. The results reveal that digital financial inclusion helps reduce the probability that urban households will fall into relative poverty. Digital financial inclusion not only promotes entrepreneurship by urban households but also increases their participation in the financial market. The increase in their income flow can be translated into an improvement in the stock of wealth, enabling them to avoid falling into relative poverty. But this effect is heterogeneous. Digital investment and digital credit play more important roles than digital payment. It is also more pronounced in households with higher financial literacy and households in smaller cities. In addition, regardless of how the relative poverty line and digital financial inclusion are calculated, our results are robust. The research in this study is important for a comprehensive understanding of the development of digital financial inclusion and urban relative poverty in developing countries such as China. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Financial literacy is the ability of people to process economic information to make better financial decisions. Therefore, the financial literacy of entrepreneurs could affect the management of their companies and their results. The aim of this research is to determine if there is a significant relationship between companies’ performance and financial knowledge, financial behavior, and financial attitude of micro, small, and medium-sized entrepreneurs. The incidence of the variables age, size, and sector of the companies, as well as the entrepreneur’s age, gender, and educational level on companies’ performance, is also analyzed. Data from 206 entrepreneurs from Veracruz, Mexico, were analyzed using a logistic regression model. The results show that the financial behavior of the entrepreneurs has a positive and highly significant effect on companies’ performance, although the entrepreneur´s knowledge and attitude don´t have a significant relationship with companies´ performance. The results also show that companies in the industrial sector led by men are less likely to obtain high performance compared to those in the commerce sector. No incidence was found of the variables age, size of the company, and entrepreneur´s educational level on the performance of their companies. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Alleviating household economic fragility and poverty is a global challenge in achieving a nation’s well-being. This study aims to examine the impact of social capital and Indonesian household economic welfare, as well as understand the mediating role of entrepreneurial, digital, and financial literacy. To address this objective, a structural equation modeling partial least square was adopted to acquire comprehend findings. The survey data were gathered from households in East Java of Indonesia using a simple random sampling approach. The findings from this study highlight that social capital significantly influences several literacies of households in Indonesia, including digital literacy, financial literacy, and entrepreneurial literacy. However, this study failed to confirm the nexus between social capital and household economic welfare. In addition, financial literacy, digital literacy, and entrepreneurial literacy all play an important role in mediating the connection between social capital and the economic welfare of households. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - We analyze the risk attitude of women and men entrepreneurs in the micro and small enterprises (MSEs) and investigate the factors that influence the risk attitude of MSE owners. The empirical analysis of the study consists of two parts. First, we use a moment-based approach to estimate the risk preferences of male and female entrepreneurs. Second, we estimate a regression model to understand the correlates of risk attitude and decompose the gender difference in risk aversion using the Oaxaca-Blinder technique. The results indicate that MSE entrepreneurs are risk-averse, with a relative risk premium of 1.5%. We also find that females are slightly more risk-averse than male entrepreneurs. Our regression estimates show that entrepreneurs’ risk attitude is significantly correlated with the age and experience of the entrepreneur, marital status, education level and financial literacy, wealth, sector, and business form. Furthermore, the predictor variables significantly explain the gender difference in risk aversion, while the unexplained component is insignificant. This suggests that the gender difference in risk aversion is due to disparities in socioeconomic factors than a biological difference in risk preference. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) by integrating FinTech with the the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By focusing on three dimensions (inclusive finance, economy, and environment), we identify how FinTech may influence sustainable development. We innovate using human- and machine-generated processing to develop themes, making systematic literature reviews more objective and advancing replicability and reproducibility. This study demonstrates the contribution of FinTech in expanding the investment opportunity set by including environmental projects and increasing the diversity and participation rates of savers and lenders. Through this process, FinTech increases its market completeness. Accordingly, FinTech can increase economic growth by achieving higher productivity and sustainable growth through diversification, technological upgrades, entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation. Additionally, FinTech can accelerate investments in poverty eradication and reduce income inequality. These contributions are aligned with specific SDGs and show that FinTech is an appropriate new technology for financial services. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Adequate financial decision-making necessitates a solid foundation in financial literacy and comprehension of its principles. This is particularly crucial for students, as their financial and behavioral choices can significantly impact their future financial and career prospects. Consequently, the present study aimed to explore the causal links between economics education, financial literacy, decision-making abilities, and entrepreneurial intentions. Employing a descriptive-correlational approach, the researchers utilized structural equation modeling, drawing on a sample of 375 individuals purposefully selected from a population of 11,345 students at Urmia University. Data were collected through a questionnaire, and the research variables were initially assessed using multiple correspondence analysis. Subsequently, the research model was estimated. The findings revealed a positive and substantial impact of economics education on students' financial literacy and the influence of economics education on decision-making skills and entrepreneurial intentions through the mediating factor of financial literacy. Furthermore, the results confirmed the moderating role of socioeconomic status in the relationship between economics education and financial literacy. Consequently, the study's outcomes can inform educational institutions and policymakers, supporting the implementation of policies aimed at enhancing general economic education and emphasizing the equitable and distributive nature of such initiatives.  © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

AB  - Background This study aimed to explore the attitudes and practices of dental professionals regarding alternative sources of revenue through a descriptive cross-sectional design and to explore other demographic factors which influence them. Materials and Methods A Descriptive Cross-Sectional study was conducted among 400 dental professionals selected using stratified random sampling and were approached either personally or through electronic medium to fill a pre-tested validated questionnaire assessing their attitudes and practices towards alternative sources of revenue. The data were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 26.0. Cross tabulations were made and statistical significance was assessed using Pearson’s Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test. A Binary Logistic Regression model was developed to predict the practice of alternative sources of revenue based on gender, qualification, occupation, and experience. Results The results showed that about 36% of the participants are currently pursuing alternative sources of income with a significantly higher percentage of females involved (p=0.005). Most of the participants (37.6%) reported investing in stocks and finance followed by real estate, food industry, career guidance, product development etc. Around two-thirds of females reported being unsatisfied with their current income from dentistry and they have 1.76 times the odds of pursuing alternative sources compared to males (p=0.022). Undergraduate dentists have 2.51 times the odds of practising other means of revenue. Conclusions The study concludes that a substantial percentage of respondents had pursued alternative sources of revenue. Policymakers and educators can use these findings to develop strategies to promote entrepreneurship and financial literacy among dental professionals. © The Ibn Sina Trust.

AB  - Agricultural entrepreneurship significantly improves farmers' livelihoods and it also contributes toward poverty reduction. In the present study, we used the data of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS 2019) as a sample, and empirically examined the dynamic linkages between adoption of digital technology (ADT) and farmers' agricultural entrepreneurial willingness (AEW). The findings of this study reveal that (1) the ADT significantly improved farmers' AEW by 18.5%; (2) the ADT more significantly affected the entrepreneurial willingness of farmers who live in less developed rural areas, or who preference for risk, or whose households have not been affected by major adverse events, or who belong to the rural elite; (3) digital financial participation plays a partial mediating effect of 11.7% in the effect of the ADT on farmers' AEW, with financial literacy and subjective well-being having moderating effects and reinforcing the effect of the ADT on farmers' AEW. Finally, we put forward several policy recommendations, such as narrowing the ‘three-level digital divide’, improving digital human capital, and developing digital inclusive finance to provide new ideas for farmer entrepreneurship, to enhance farmer's livelihood and to promote rural economic development. © 2023

AB  - This paper investigated the influence of entrepreneurial competency and financial literacy on sustainable small enterprise performance. We simultaneously investigated the mediating role of entrepreneurial resilience on the association between competence and financial literacy with sustainable business performance. We used a quantitative method for collecting data from 220 small business entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia using an online questionnaire. The collected data were analysed with the help of PLS-SEM. The results reveal that financial literacy significantly positively affects entrepreneurial competency and resilience. Entrepreneurial competency has a significant positive effect on Saudi SMEs’ entrepreneurial resilience and sustainable performance. Finally, entrepreneurial resilience was simultaneously found to have a considerable impact on sustainable performance while mediating the effect of financial literacy and competency on sustainable performance across Saudi SMEs. In line with Saudi Vision 2030, with its profound focus on entrepreneurship and developing a financially independent entrepreneurial community, this research contributes to creating economic opportunities for local entrepreneurs managing small enterprises. Apart from extending the body of knowledge, this research can support policymakers in formulating relevant strategies to encourage SMEs that have been worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic to perform sustainably. Several other implications for financial institutions and entrepreneurs have also been drawn. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The application of digital technology has reshaped all aspects of social life, and the impact of financial technology on the economy is unprecedented. Consumption is an eternal issue in economic development; however, most existing studies have concentrated on how digital inclusive Finance affects household consumption levels, giving little attention to consumption volatility. Nonetheless, policies that overlook consumption volatility are less likely to achieve societal welfare goals, particularly in developing countries. This study aims to fill this gap and unveil the “black box” of the impact of digital inclusive Finance on consumption volatility, which can benefit the development of economic resilience. Utilizing data from the China Household Finance Survey, our research assesses the impact of digital inclusive Finance on household consumption volatility and discovers that digital inclusive Finance significantly smooths out these fluctuations. Mechanism tests further indicate that the main transmission channels for this impact are promoting entrepreneurship and reducing income volatility. Moreover, heterogeneity tests show that the effect of digital inclusive Finance in smoothing household consumption volatility is more pronounced in households with sound financial standing, higher financial literacy, and internet access, especially in rural areas. These findings enrich the literature on digital inclusive Finance's role in managing volatility and extend the theory on the inclusive nature of digital inclusive Finance, offering valuable practical implications for developing countries. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Research methodology: This case is based on primary data collected via interviews with the CEO of the company. The authors obtained the case release form to publish this case. Case overview/synopsis: Various stakeholders, regulators, environmental activists and public awareness have increased companies’ pressure to contribute to environmental issues. However, the pressure seems to be more on large-scale companies to make progress and have an elaborate vision and goals related to environmental issues than small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This case deals with the sustainability focus of the CEO of Ruscombe Artisan Food & Drink Ltd. (Made for Drink), an SME in the UK with a voluntary environmental impact investment proposal under consideration while having losses since 2017. The case integrates the financial aspects and environmental considerations into this strategic investment evaluation process for making a capital investment decision. The case provides the actual financials of the company, including the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement of the company since its inception in 2017. The case information enables students to comprehend and evaluate the consequences of doing a voluntary environmental capital investment project. The students will have the opportunity to apply simple capital investment methods and consider the external and less tangible environmental benefits in their final decision-making. Complexity academic level: The case is suitable for undergraduate accounting or management modules, mainly introductory modules such as Managing Financial Resources, International Accounting, Finance, Introductory Corporate Finance, Basic Financial Literacy and Entrepreneurship. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Traditional agricultural training programs often fall short in cultivating the comprehensive entrepreneurial skill set necessary for navigating the challenges of modern organic farming. Moreover, the potential synergies between community-based learning approaches and design thinking principles in agricultural education are yet to be fully explored. This study investigates the impact of a training approach integrating community-based learning and design thinking to enhance entrepreneurship competencies among organic farmers in Khon Kaen province, Thailand. Using a quasi-experimental design involving sixty participants, the study employs pre- and post-training assessments to evaluate changes in entrepreneurship competencies, including innovation, risk management, business planning, and financial literacy.

AB  - Tourism in Terengganu deals with attractions, events, and facilities of special interest to tourists, such as Kuala Terengganu City Centre (KTCC). KTCC is a collaboration project between the Terengganu state government and the East-Cost Economic Region Development (ECERD) agency. This project purposely attracts potential foreign investors and upgrades the community's economy and social well-being in rural dan sub-urban areas in Kuala Terengganu. Therefore, this study analyzes the factors that influence the business performance among Malay micro-entrepreneurs in rural and sub-urban areas of Kuala Terengganu. The study utilized four factors, including entrepreneurial competency, financial literacy, innovation, and technology. In this survey research, non-probability has been chosen by using the purposive sampling methods. The data were collected from Malay micro-entrepreneurs operating their business, including the North and South areas of KTCC. The results showed that entrepreneurial competency and technology factors were significantly affected business performance. Meanwhile, the financial literacy and innovation factors were not significantly affected business performance among Malay micro-entrepreneurs. In general, this study's findings indicated that most Malay entrepreneurs are not concerned about the importance of managing their finance and creating innovative products in the competitive areas. Also, KTCC is a project that can benefit those Malay micro-entrepreneurs who wisely grab the opportunities. Therefore, they need to consider other entrepreneurial factors that can further develop their business performance without relying on the government and other stakeholders. © 2022 by ASERS® Publishing.

AB  - The research aims to investigate the entrepreneurial skills and financial literacy’s impact on the improved performance in the biotechnology sector. Entrepreneurial skills enable the individual to manage the business through taking essential actions, and along with financial literacy the utilization of resources in an optimum way is assured as well. The decision maker would invest in development of organizational capabilities required to succeed in market. Being a high risky domain, the utilization of financial resources through financial knowledge is crucial in biotech sector. To conduct this research, the quantitative research design including survey approach has been adopted. Questionnaires were distributed followed by the statistical testing of data through SPSS. The results indicated a significant association among financial literacy and performance along with a significant association between entrepreneurial skills and performance of biotechnology firms in Swiss. The research holds greater theoretical and practical importance. This study suggests that financial learning and entrepreneurial skills pioneer the development of biotech firms by having a higher speed of innovation. Regarding its implications for public authorities, the substantial need to promote FL and ES is highlighted. Thus public policies extend entrepreneurial skills and financing knowledge by improving the decision-making process. © 2023 ThinkBiotech LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this research is to explore the relationship between digital financial literacy (DFL) and digital financial inclusion (DFI) while considering gender differences. The study employed convenience sampling and collected primary data through a questionnaire. The analysis involved a multi-group assessment to examine how DFL influences DFI in distinct gender categories. The results reveal a noteworthy association between DFL and DFI among both females and males. Interestingly, the impact of DFL on DFI appears to be more pronounced within the female group, suggesting that enhancing digital financial literacy can be particularly beneficial for women's financial inclusion. However, it is essential to note that the disparity in the effect of DFL on DFI between the two gender groups does not reach statistical significance. This finding underscores the overall significance of DFL in advancing digital financial inclusion across all genders. These results have substantial implications for policymakers and financial institutions. The study underscores the importance of promoting digital financial literacy to improve digital financial inclusion. While the influence of DFL seems slightly stronger for females, addressing digital financial literacy comprehensively for all genders remains vital in the pursuit of inclusive financial systems. By expanding digital financial literacy initiatives and making them accessible to diverse populations, policymakers and financial institutions can contribute to more equitable financial inclusion. This research highlights the need for gender-inclusive strategies and underscores that bolstering DFL can be a pivotal step towards achieving comprehensive financial inclusion on a broader scale. © 2024 Conscientia Beam.

AB  - The development of halal tourism in Indonesia is the focus of the Indonesian government and MSMEs have an important role in supporting the development of halal tourism in Indonesia. This study aims to examine the relationship between marketing communication and Islamic financial literacy on Islamic financial inclusion and MSME performance in the halal-tourism sector. A covariance-based SEM technique utilizing LISREL software was used to analyze the data from this investigation. Nonprobability sampling was employed to collect the data, and the sample consists of 152 halal-tourism entrepreneurs. This study found a positive and significant association between Islamic financial inclusion and business performance. This study also found that there is a positive and significant association between Islamic financial literacy and Islamic financial inclusion. Marketing communication and Islamic financial inclusion have a positive relationship, but it is insignificant. This study implies that to establish a halal-tourist ecosystem for long-term development in Indonesia, commercial actors must lend their full support. This study demonstrates that they can thrive when MSMEs in the halal-tourist ecosystem are backed by Islamic banking and Islamic rural banks. As a result, a more accommodating approach from Islamic banking is required to provide access to halal finance for business actors in Indonesia’s halal-tourism ecosystem. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 virus brought down the economies of various countries and the livelihoods of the public. World economy witnessed a lower amount of the economic growth. Indian economy also fared poor during the pandemic. The pandemic generated unemployment, job loss, pay cut, and closure of many business organizations in India. Unemployment and low income caused psychological stress and financial stress among the public and among the businessmen especially micro, and small entrepreneurs (MSES). The Indian economy is bouncing back to normalcy. MSES exhibit stronger resilience during the hard time. The study is interested to measure and analyse the determinants that promote financial resilience among the MSES in India. Based on existing literature, financial literacy is chosen to study the nexus between financial stress and financial resilience of the entrepreneurs. © 2023, Indian Institute of Finance.

AB  - Research on financial literacy has increased over time, particularly in light of the severe effects of the 2008 global financial crisis and the necessity of empowering individuals’ financial well-being. This study employs bibliometric analysis to reaffirm the multidisciplinary nature of this topic. It displays the most influential authors, journals, articles, keywords, and time trends. In addition, using topic modeling, this study reveals the top ten sub-topics discussed in 2,538 Web of Science-extracted publications over the past quarter-century (1998–2022). Some sub-topics have persisted over time (e.g., financial education), whereas others were introduced much later (e.g., entrepreneurialism). Future research should use the findings of this study to categorize the relevant theories in financial literacy and investigate unexplored topics. © (2023), (Social Sciences Research Society).

AB  - The convergence of social capital and financial intelligence becomes a dynamic catalyst in the realm of post-pandemic challenges, promoting entrepreneurial financial performance to unforeseen levels as businesses use networks, knowledge, and financial expertise to overcome challenges and grasp new opportunities. Hence, the study explores the factors that influence entrepreneurial financial performance of employees in Pakistan’s corporate sector. Using two theoretical frameworks, Regulatory Focus Theory and Rubicon Four-Phase Action Model in Entrepreneurship, study identifies essential traits for entrepreneurship and their direct correlation with financial success. The study utilized a survey questionnaire to gather responses from 276 employees of the corporate sector involved in entrepreneurial activities. The findings suggest that financial literacy, financial risk tolerance, entrepreneurial competency, and social capital positively impact an entrepreneur’s locus of control and financial intelligence. Financial literacy equips entrepreneurs with necessary skills and knowledge to manage finances effectively, identify potential financial risks, and increase profitability. Financial risk tolerance enables entrepreneurs to understand financial markets better and make sound financial decisions. Entrepreneurial competency leads to sound financial decision-making and control of financial outcomes. Social capital provides valuable resources, information, and support to improve financial decision-making skills. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study provides first empirical evidence on the impact of entrepreneurs’ financial literacy on borrower discouragement. Using novel survey data on Italian micro-enterprises, we find that less financially knowledgeable entrepreneurs are more likely to be discouraged from applying for new financing, especially due to higher application costs. Our results are robust to several sensitivity checks, including accounting for potential endogeneity. Furthermore, we show that the observed self-rationing mechanism is rather inefficient, suggesting that financial literacy might play a key role in reducing credit market imperfections. © 2024

AB  - This study investigates the theoretical link between heuristic behavioral factors and the investment decision-making of women entrepreneurs, focusing on the importance of financial literacy as a potential mediator shaping prudent decision-making. We argue that women’s financial literacy is an efficient way to apply behavioral considerations in wise decision making. Using the proportionate stratified sampling method, we collected data from women entrepreneurs who were formally registered in Punjab Province, Pakistan. Owing to the complex model and small sample size, the smart PLS method was applied to analyze the structural relationship between the measured and latent constructs. The results show that overconfidence and availability heuristics have a significant positive impact on investment decisions, while financial literacy plays an essential intervening role between the overconfidence heuristic, availability heuristic, and investment decision-making. Our results support the execution of financial literacy awareness among women entrepreneurs to stimulate their financial decision control and give them the independence to make prudent financial decisions. © 2023, Gadjah Mada University.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore schoolteachers’ experiences of knowledge sharing as a source of informal learning in the workplace when teaching new education programs on financial literacy and entrepreneurial skills. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on interviews with American schoolteachers teaching education programs provided by Junior Achievement USA that aim to equip pupils with practical skills in financial literacy and entrepreneurship to improve their work-readiness in adult life. Findings: The findings of this study indicate that knowledge sharing is a source of informal learning among the teachers when dealing with the JA programs. This takes place through collaboration in communities of practice. Experienced teachers (who have previously taught the programs) are especially valuable in sharing their insights and helping the teachers prepare their teaching. Such knowledge-sharing practices help the schoolteachers to improve their practices. Having a supportive social culture encourages knowledge sharing between schoolteachers, but more time is needed to prioritize this kind of collaboration between co-workers. Originality/value: Teaching financial literacy and entrepreneurship through pupil-driven activities can be experienced as different from teaching regular subjects, and teachers in the study seem to benefit from sharing experiences when it comes to preparing or adding to their teaching. The findings suggest that to facilitate knowledge-sharing practices can be helpful to schoolteachers when introducing new topics and pedagogical methods in schools. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In spite of the devastating effects of COVID-19 on businesses, many SMEs have demonstrated resilience and continued on with their operations. This study investigates the determinants of SMEs’ business resilience in Malaysia and Indonesia, with a focus on the moderating factor of technology adoption. The Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, the Dynamic Capability View Theory (DCV), and the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework were combined to analyze a set of business resilience-impacting factors in each country. Online surveys with respondents were used to gather data. Partial least squares-based structural equation modeling was used to examine a total of 539 respondents, of whom 335 were from Indonesia and 204 were from Malaysia. The results showed that government support, technological use, and compliance costs have a significant direct impact on the business resilience of SMEs in both countries. Notably, it was discovered that there were insignificant effects from financial resources and financial literacy. The association between financial resources and business resilience in Indonesia and the relationship between government support and business resilience in Malaysia are both negatively moderated by technology adoption. The findings of this study contributed to a multigroup analysis between neighboring countries, offering valuable insights on the factors influencing SMEs’ business resilience to withstand the COVID-19 crisis and their subsequent recovery. It helps explain how SMEs cope with the epidemic, use government support, and use technology to adapt to the changing business climate. These findings enabled SMEs and governments to use preparation and resilience methods to anticipate future difficulties. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: The objective of the article is to investigate whether the impact of innovativeness and competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on their financial risks differ depending on the countries where SMEs are located. Research Design & Methods: The researchers created an online questionnaire and gained data from 1221 Czech, Slovak, and Hungarian SMEs. Moreover, the researchers applied ordinal logistic regression analyses to achieve the goal of this study. Findings: According to the results, the impact of competitiveness on the bankruptcy risk perception of SMEs differ depending on the countries where they operate. Concerning the impact of innovativeness on financial performance and financial risk management, this article also proves that international differences between SMEs exist. Implications & Recommendations: The developments in the financial literacy of company executives and their managerial experiences and the improvements in credit access conditions, intellectual property rights, and tax legislation can make SMEs reduce their concerns about their financial risks. Thus, policymakers’ im-plementations are crucial to providing equal opportunities for SMEs even if they operate in various markets. Contribution & Value Added: This current research does not only make international comparisons among the investigated variables but also analyses the impacts of entrepreneurial competencies on various indicators of financial risk. These facts not only make this research become a unique study in the literature but also the reason why it should garner the interest of prospective readers such as policymakers, academicians, and SME owners. © 2022, Cracow University of Economics.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to make an exploratory analysis of the impact of the entrepreneurial ecosystem (EE) as defined by Acs et al. (2014) on opportunity-driven senior entrepreneurial activity in Latin America. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute of five Latin America countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico), providing a total of 15,019 observations of people that are 50+ years old, between the years 2013 and 2017. A multi-level logistic regression model was used to estimate the relation between the total entrepreneurial activity by opportunity of seniors and some EE indicators. A total of three equations were estimated on the data set described. Findings: This research confirms the relevance of some elements of EE on senior entrepreneurship in Latin America. Entrepreneurial attitudes have a positive relationship with senior entrepreneurs, generating higher levels of entrepreneurial ventures. The combination of institutions that support these attitudes on the EE enhances senior entrepreneurial activity. It also demonstrates that a higher level of entrepreneurial education at postschool stages is relevant to increasing senior entrepreneurial activity. Originality/value: This research makes some interesting contributions in the field of measuring the impact of EE on senior entrepreneurship by opportunity in developing countries, filling a literature gap. It allows us to glimpse some measures that policymakers could take to improve the entrepreneurial activity of this segment in the region, such as implementing programs that facilitate networking opportunities and mentorship, along with providing training in business and financial literacy. © 2024, Alfonso Torres-Marín, José Ernesto Amorós, Marcelo Leporati and Sergio Roses.

AB  - Farmers’ entrepreneurship is an important factor in promoting rural economic growth, yet few studies have systematically discussed the impact of financial literacy. Using the 2021 China Land Economic Survey data, this study analyzes the relationship between financial literacy and Chinese rural households’ entrepreneurship from the perspective of credit constraints and risk preferences by the IV-probit, stepwise regression, and moderating effects methods. This study finds that: (1) the financial literacy of Chinese farmers is low, with only 11.2% of the sample households starting businesses; and (2) Financial literacy can promote rural households’ entrepreneurship. After introducing an instrument variable to control endogenous problems, the positive correlation is still significant; (3) financial literacy effectively alleviates the traditional credit constraints of farmers, thereby promoting entrepreneurship; (4) risk preference weakens the positive impact of financial literacy on rural households’ entrepreneurship. This study provides a reference for optimizing entrepreneurship policies. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to determine the contribution of financial skills to entrepreneurial intentions among women involved in university education. Design/methodology/approach: Clustering and logistic regression analyses were used to infer the determinants and motivators of entrepreneurial intention in a sample of women students at a Spanish online university. Findings: Financial and numerical skills could play a significant role in boosting entrepreneurial culture, overcoming reticence and increasing awareness of business opportunities, particularly when women are motivated to increase their autonomy and income. The study offers meaningful implications for policymakers. Research limitations/implications: Further research will be needed before these conclusions may be inferred to other settings and circumstances. Comparison with a similar sample of potential male entrepreneurs may also be necessary to deduce the influence of gender. Practical implications: The introduction of certain financial content into the education system by governments and policymakers would produce remarkable results on entrepreneurship intention among women. Social implications: Relational capital and positive social influences also contribute to mitigating the effects of risk aversion, one of the main barriers for potential female entrepreneurs. Originality/value: The role of financial literacy in entrepreneurial intention among women has scarcely been addressed in academic research. The literature also has paid little attention to the analysis of what motivates women into entrepreneurship, and whether women who decide to embark on a business venture show different profiles. The aim of this study is to contribute to closing these gaps, exploring the effect of cognitive skills, personality traits, contextual factors and motivations. © 2021, Josep Llados-Masllorens and Elisabet Ruiz-Dotras.

AB  - Financial literacy can be critical to reducing poverty, but limited evidence exists on the mechanisms of change. Guided by the financial capability framework, this study examines the direct effects of financial literacy on poverty and the indirect effect through financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, using data from wave 5 of the InterMedia Financial Inclusion Insights Program for Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. We also examined how the relationships differ by gender and locality. Overall, the endogeneity-corrected results suggest that an increase in financial literacy is associated with a 6.9% decrease in poverty. We found that entrepreneurship and financial inclusion act as mechanisms of change through which financial literacy decreases poverty, with the findings differing by gender and locality. These findings point to the poverty-reducing effect of financial literacy, mainly in Tanzania, followed by Kenya and Uganda. The results contribute to understanding how financial literacy and poverty interact and can inform contextually relevant interventions and policies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - We examine the impact of financial literacy on the propensity for entrepreneurship among rural–urban migrants, using panel data from the 2013 and 2015 China Household Finance Survey. While migration's positive influence on entrepreneurship is well-recognised, we document novel evidence suggesting that higher levels of financial literacy among rural–urban migrants have an additional positive effect. Among the mechanisms through which financial literacy facilitates the transition of disadvantaged rural–urban migrants into entrepreneurs, social capital emerges as the most important, consistent with the findings of the literature on underdog entrepreneurship. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates the factors influencing the intention to use Islamic Debt Financing (IDF) among owners-managers of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Morocco. Design/methodology/approach: We developed and validated a comprehensive model that examines the key behavioral elements affecting attitude towards IDF, entrepreneurial achievement motivation, and IDF usage intention. Entrepreneurial achievement motivation was assessed as a mediator in the relationship between attitude towards IDF and usage intention. Gender and Islamic religiosity were examined as moderators through Multi-Group analysis. Utilizing data from 266 Moroccan MSMEs, we applied structural equation modeling for empirical evaluation. Findings: Results revealed direct relationships with financial literacy, risk perception, and cost perception negatively affecting attitude toward IDF. Financial suitability is inversely related to attitude toward IDF. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy and subjective norms positively influenced entrepreneurial achievement motivation. Attitude toward IDF positively impacted entrepreneurial achievement motivation, and both attitude toward IDF and entrepreneurial achievement motivation were linked to the intention to use IDF. Empirical findings indicated that entrepreneurial achievement motivation partially mediates the relationship between attitude towards IDF and usage intention. Multi-group analysis revealed a significant moderating effect of Islamic religiosity on three out of nine structural relationships. Research limitations/implications: This study is primarily limited by the absence of a longitudinal examination tracking real usage behavior. Moreover, data collection focused on analyzing the behavioral intention to use Islamic debt-based financing products, excluding equity-based financing instruments. Finally, our proposed model concentrates on establishing usage intention solely based on demand-side factors without explicitly integrating supply-side consideration. Practical implications: Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of IDF adoption behavior and have the potential to support the development of more effective public policies, targeted promotional campaigns, and impactful financial education programs for MSMEs in similar markets. Originality/value: This paper represents the first attempt to address MSMEs’ apprehensions regarding Islamic debt-based financing products in the MENA region. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Within the next decade, the number of self-employed workers, now 40% of the workforce, is predicted to surpass that of traditional employees. Managing finances (financial literacy) is an important skill set for self-employment. We bring attention to the growing prevalence of self-employment at a time when financial literacy is in decline in the United States. Using a sample of 15,069 participants in the 2015 and 2018 National Financial Capability Study, we find support for a positive association between financial literacy and self-employment in a U.S. context and extend prior research by focusing on two widely studied and important U.S. demographic segments in self-employment and entrepreneurship literature – gender and race. Contrary to other U.S.-based studies, we find that women with higher financial literacy scores are more likely to be self-employed than men; yet surprisingly, there is no significant difference in the association between higher financial literacy scores and self-employment between non-white and white U.S. respondents. We discuss the implications of the findings for researchers, policymakers, educators, and those considering self-employment. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: First, this study aims to investigate the factors affecting entrepreneurial intentions. Second, it is to identify the influential factors with the highest influence on entrepreneurial intention. Design/methodology/approach: The sample of the current study was female employees in various hospitality firms, including restaurants, hotels and wellness services. The questionnaire was developed based on past research studies and was tested for reliability prior to the full set of data collection. To represent the early to mid-level career women in hospitality, female employees with at least one-year experience from hospitality businesses, such as restaurants and hotels, participated in the study and total usable samples were 416. Findings: The findings demonstrated that attitude toward risk-taking, self-efficacy, subjective norm and empowerment is significantly influential to the entrepreneurial intention of the women in the hospitality industry. Based on the data analysis, attitude toward risk-taking has the highest influence on entrepreneurial intention. In other words, with a positive attitude toward risk-taking, female employees showed the greatest tendency to start their own business. Research limitations/implications: The current study extended the theory of planned behavior in that it can be used to explain the women’s entrepreneurial intention with subjective norms, attitudes and self-efficacy. The study also highlighted the flexibility of the theory in allowing the researchers to add external variables to help further investigate the relationships among all the factors in the models. Practical implications: To highlight the opportunity to promote more equality and diversity in the business management environments, the results from the study promoted the roles of women entrepreneurs to support hospitality business development. One of the most influential factors is the attitude toward risk-taking. This suggested that with the positive attitude toward risk, the respondents have higher entrepreneurial intentions. Promoting and sharing the success stories of female entrepreneurs can affect the attitude of female employees and raise their interests toward becoming entrepreneurs. Originality/value: The current study provided a unique investigation on the early to mid-level career hospitality female employees to explore their intention to be entrepreneurs. This research offered the extension of the theory of planned behavior in the context of entrepreneurship. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The international community recognizes the role of entrepreneurship education in fostering economic growth and sustainable development. However, preparing the next generation of entrepreneurs is not an easy task, since today’s complexity requires the creation of skills and capabilities for which the traditional programs reveal their inadequacy. Some scholars remark how entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intention are not necessarily related and, in line with policy makers’ concerns, call for educational programs more routed in financial skills’ enhancement. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of system dynamics (SD) for entrepreneurial education, investigating the relationships between financial and entrepreneurial skills’ formation and business development. Design/methodology/approach: The paper introduces the main elements of SD, describes literature streams of SD applications fitting the entrepreneurial education spheres and proposes an SD’ insight model based on selected literature and declined in terms of stock-and-flow and causal loop structures. Findings: The study provides a causal model capturing the links between the processes of entrepreneurial skill formation and firms’ start-ups and closures. Such model introduces a double effect of financial literacy on entrepreneurial orientation and locates the contribution of simulated entrepreneurial decisions in formal and informal educational contexts. Originality/value: The paper displays how SD can contribute to entrepreneurship and presents an original causal model highlighting the accumulation of financial and non-financial skills through education and experience, their impact on business development and the usefulness of SD methodology for skill achievement. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to examine the relationship between artistic orientation and entrepreneurial performance and how other central entrepreneurial resources, namely, entrepreneurial orientation and financial literacy, affect this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Regulatory focus theory was used to develop the model. A survey of 375 small creative business entrepreneurs was conducted in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and a hierarchical linear regression was used for data analysis. Findings: The results reveal a positive correlation between artistic orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, financial literacy and entrepreneurial performance. Therefore, artistic orientation affects a creative firm’s financial and nonfinancial performance. In addition, artistic orientation and financial literacy provide a positive influence on the overall performance of a creative venture. However, the interaction effect of entrepreneurial orientation and financial literacy on the artistic orientation – performance relationship – is invisible Practical implications: This research provides guidance on how creative firms may focus on the acquisition, development and protection of useful resources, namely, artistic orientation and financial literacy Originality/value: This research is the first systematic empirical test evaluating the relationship between artistic orientation and entrepreneurial performance. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the determinants of general financial literacy, specific financial literacy and overall financial literacy among the Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) entrepreneurs. The data has been collected from 309 respondents from three districts in the Punjab state of India. Using ordered logit model, the results depict that the age of the entrepreneur has positive and significant effect on different types of financial literacy for the MSEs in Punjab. The findings also show that the micro and small-service enterprises have significantly higher level of financial literacy than its other manufacturing counterparts. The study also found that entrepreneurs with higher level of education have significantly higher level of all types of financial literacy. The most influencing determinant that affects the financial literacy of the entrepreneurs is found to be the level of gross profit ratio of the enterprise. Higher the gross profit ratio of the firm, significantly higher will be the level of all three types of financial literacy of the entrepreneurs. For policy perspectives, the present study recommends that firms should keep some portion of their profits to educate their employees that enhance the financial literacy. Government should help the MSEs to educate the firms to improve their level of financial literacy. © 2021

AB  - There is a socially constructed perception that people with mental illnesses do not have the resilience to endure the pressures of the capitalist model of work. Solidarity economy (se) appears as an alternative for the inclusion of mentally ill people in the realm of work and productivity, enabling them to (re)produce their subjectivities. In this study, we develop a critical reflection on the possibilities of entrepreneuring, solidarity economy, and financial/accounting literacy as tools towards a health promotion strategy that empowers and allows the emancipation of these individuals, so that they may (re)write their stories and give society an account of themselves other than their mental illness. This paper starts from the analysis of the experience of two Brazilian se ventures engaged in mental health promotion, in which we proposed and conducted a financial education program aimed at providing se worker-members with tools to actively participate in discussions about financial and accounting-related decisions. Afterwards, we engaged in an action research exercise, building on lessons learned: the importance of abandoning preconceived ideas of mental illness and relying on sharing experiences and participation; and how real-life struggles are a source of knowledge, as discussed through the concept of “learning by doing.”. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - Many entrepreneurs in Latvia are limited in choice of tools for the improvement of their financial literacy. Therefore the training course “Financial literacy of entrepreneurs in the field of financial viability management” was elaborated and tested with the aim to improve the course and reveal the challenges facing different categories of learners. The research was formative as it combined the promotion of learners and trainers’ competencies and behaviours with the research process throughout all the five training cycles. The research methods applied were chosen based on the inner logics and aims of the teaching and learning processes: videorecording of learners’ activities and analysis of the videomaterials; analysis of the learners’ work and reflections. Out of the identified sixteen challenges faced by learners, three were especially crucial and caused further difficulties in coping with different tasks on assessment and management of company’s financial viability. It was concluded that there may be three categories of learners whose training should be organised in different modes taking into account the level of their preparedness in accountancy, tax accounting and financial analysis. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Our research examines the financial goals, knowledge, self-esteem, attitudes and strategies of young people studying in Hungarian higher education (N = 2557) by classifying youngsters into three groups. Anxious unwary: they are characterized by both living for the day and anxiety, they choose external control strategies, (advantageous marriage, wealthy family). Prudent risk-averse: who are thoughtful, frugal, avoid taking risks. They choose an internal control strategy: budgeting and hard work. Consciously confident: their knowledge and skills are outstanding, their confidence is realistic. They are entrepreneurial and risk-taking choosing long-term, internal control strategies to achieve their financial goals that help them grow their income. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Estimation of the causal effect of a binary treatment on outcomes often requires conditioning on covariates to address selection concerning observed variables. This is not straightforward when one or more of the covariates are measured with error. Here, we present a new semi-parametric estimator that addresses this issue. In particular, we focus on inverse propensity score weighting estimators when the propensity score is of an unknown functional form and some covariates are subject to classical measurement error. Our proposed solution involves deconvolution kernel estimators of the propensity score and the regression function weighted by a deconvolution kernel density estimator. Simulations and replication of a study examining the impact of two financial literacy interventions on the business practices of entrepreneurs show our estimator to be valuable to empirical researchers. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to establish the moderating effect of financial literacy in the relationship between access to finance and growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing economies. Thus, this study seeks to establish whether financial literacy moderates the relationship between access to finance and growth of SMEs in a developing economy like Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: Cross-sectional research design was used in the study and data were collected from 169 SMEs located in Jinja and Iganga central markets. ModGraph (excel programme) was used to test for the moderating effect of financial literacy in the relationship between access to finance and growth of SMEs in developing economies. Findings: The findings reveal a positive and significant moderating effect of financial literacy in the relationship between access to finance and growth of SMEs in developing economies. In addition, financial literacy and access to finance also have significant and positive effects on growth of SMEs in developing economies. Research limitations/implications: The study collected data from only SMEs located in Uganda, and there is an opportunity to test this finding in other developing economies. Furthermore, the findings from the study are based on quantitative data collected through use of semi-structured questionnaires. Besides, the study was purely cross-sectional; hence, it ignores the characteristics of SMEs, which could be investigated using a longitudinal study design. Practical implications: The study highlights the importance of financial literacy in promoting access to finance, which is necessary for the growth of SMEs in developing economies. Owners of SMEs could attend financial literacy programmes provided by entrepreneurial skill development organizations to enable them to acquire financial knowledge and skills to make wise and better financial decisions and choices. Originality/value: The study contributes to existing international entrepreneurship literature by indicating the moderating effect of financial literacy in the relationship between access to finance and growth of SMEs in developing economies. The study shows that for SMEs to access finance to grow there is a need for financial literacy that promotes effective and efficient use of loans/credits. SMEs in developing economies need financial literacy, which helps them make wise financial decisions and choices before accessing financial services like loans. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Using a randomized control trial, we evaluated the effect of a financial literacy program on the level of debt and on formal access to credit in Chile. We use a sample of beneficiaries of a publicly run micro-entrepreneurship program. We evaluated the program using administrative data with information on the debt level, interest rates, and new loans provided by the formal sector. The program tends to decreased debt level in the short run while increasing the probability of having formal debt. The program had effects in parts of the country where the take-up was higher and the implementation was smoother. © 2017, European Association of Development Research and Training Institutes (EADI).

AB  - Access to finance through financial institutions is highly dependent on financial literacy. The basic purpose of this paper is to examine the women’s financial literacy level in Pakistan, especially, among women entrepreneurs. This study also tries to determine the effect of the financial literacy of women entrepreneurs on their access to finance and subsequent financial decision-making about their businesses. Current research conducted in this study used semi-structured questionnaires, selected interviews, and focus groups. Findings show that women entrepreneurs lack proper knowledge of financial terminologies, mechanisms of financial access, and government initiatives for women entrepreneurs. It is suggested in the light of these findings, that all the relevant stakeholders should work together to enhance financial literacy among current and prospective women entrepreneurs of Pakistan. Strengthening women's entrepreneurship may play a significant role to alleviate poverty among the female population of the country. © University of Tehran.

AB  - In the last decade, remittances have become connected to financialization, expanding financial markets and deepening financial logics in what has been termed the financialization of remittances (FOR). In Nepal, where remittances are of key importance, this manifests itself in the country's development strategy through attempts to formalize remittances and promote financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and financial infrastructure. This article focuses on the most salient manifestation of the FOR in Nepal: a large-scale financial literacy education (FLE) campaign for transnational families. To examine how this FOR-FLE complex works, we bring together insights on emotional governance with those on the creation of (gendered) financial subjectivities. Based on an analysis of FLE pedagogical material and interviews with FLE experts, we suggest that the FOR-FLE complex in Nepal mobilizes a pedagogy of fear and hope to discipline the financial behavior of transnational families, transforming them into self-governing miniature financial corporations. We also highlight the gender dimensions of this emotional regime, which creates terror and works to patronize, shame, and stigmatize non-migrant women of transnational families, rendering them responsible for development, decreasing out-migration, and reducing the economy's import dependency.  © The Author(s).

AB  - Consumptive behavior is the behavior of consuming goods that are actually less or not needed (especially in relation to the response to the consumption of secondary goods, namely, goods that are not really needed). This study aims to determine the influence of factors such as lifestyle, financial literacy, and social demographics on the consumptive behavior. The population in this research is students of STIE Bank BPD Jawa Tengah who had taken entrepreneurship I and II courses, with a total of 230 students, while the sample is determined by using accidental sampling technique and using Slovin formula, which obtained 70 samples. Quantitative data are used, and data collection method in this study is questionnaire. The analytical tool in this study is the multiple regression analysis. Data is processed by using the SPSS program 21. The results showed that there were positive influence of lifestyle variable on student consumptive behavior; positive influence of financial literacy variable on student consumptive behavior; and positive influence of social demographics on student consumptive behavior. The most dominant variable influencing consumptive behavior is variable X3 (social demographics) with a regression coefficient value of 0.510, followed by variable X1 (lifestyle) and variable X2 (financial literacy). © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to examine the key entrepreneurial roles (financial literacy, risk tolerance and competency) in the financial performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Pakistan and the mediating effects of locus of control and spiritual and emotional quotients. Design/methodology/approach: The study data was collected from 541 SMEs in Pakistan (the target population) through a survey and analysed with partial least squares structural equation modelling. Findings: The findings revealed that the key entrepreneurial characteristics were positively related to locus of control and spiritual quotient and elevated the financial performance in entrepreneurship. It was also reported that locus of control and spiritual quotient mediated between key entrepreneurial characteristics and financial performance. In this regard, emotional quotient strengthened the existing relationships between key characteristics, locus of control and spiritual quotient. Practical implications: This study highlighted sustainable implications for SMEs to develop an effective mechanism and improve financial performance through guidelines that emphasized entrepreneurial characteristics and behaviours towards positive entrepreneurial ventures. This study also enabled policymakers to design policies that catalysed SME performance in Pakistan. Originality/value: This study contributed a novel concept of key entrepreneurial characteristics by introducing a characteristics tool kit. Consequently, information on a unique framework (by integrating entrepreneurial characteristics and financial performance) and literature on spiritual quotient and locus of control in entrepreneurship were enriched. Contributions to the regulatory focus theory and four-phase Rubicon model in the study context were also made. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the relationship between financial literacy and the survival profile of the security-based crowdfunding platforms. Security-based crowdfunding has recently emerged as a novel market that allows small investors to engage directly in financing entrepreneurial ventures. However, a certain level of financial literacy is required to understand and manage these digital finance tools. A better understanding of the impact of financial literacy is, therefore, central to the development of these markets and the achievement of their inclusive potential. Research Findings/Insights: Using data of the universe of 432 security-based crowdfunding platforms in 37 OECD countries from 2007 to 2019, we find higher platforms' survival profiles where the level of financial literacy is high. Financial literacy, however, needs to combine with specific platform characteristics to take full effect, as it matters more to those platforms that deliver voting rights and that provide poorer value-added services to crowdfunding investors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support to the role of governance mechanisms at the platform level for differences in the level of financial literacy across countries. As such, it contributes to literature both on financial literacy and corporate governance. Additionally, it extends previous research in crowdfunding to the platform level. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study calls for the attention of policymakers interested in the development of crowdfunding markets. The importance of financial literacy varies with the presence of governance mechanisms and information production at the platform-level. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to study the status of financial literacy among small scale entrepreneurs (SSEs) in a small district of Tamil Nadu state in India. The study is based on factors influencing small scale entrepreneurs to know about financial services; the problems faced by SSE while availing financial services; their satisfaction towards banking services; and appropriate measures to be taken for improving financial literacy among SSEs. The study implemented a mixed methodology research design using both qualitative and quantitative methods. A survey was conducted among 150 selected small scale entrepreneurs using convenient sampling technique. The results of Garrett Ranking Technique showed that majority of respondents are influenced by knowledge about financial products, followed by knowledge of financial numeracy, money management, budgeting, timely payment of bills, intensity to save, propensity to consume, risk aversion and trusted financial advice. Results of Chi-Square test revealed that the demographic profiles are not significantly related to the problems of the SSEs. © 2017, ASERS Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the level of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) business owners–managers’ financial literacy and its impact on firm’s performance. The article applied a random sample and structural equation modelling (SEM) approaches in assessing the influence of SME business owners–managers’ level of financial literacy within the three states in the southwest Nigeria. The findings show the complete effect of business owner–manager’s financial knowledge, financial awareness and financial attitude in converting financial literacy to increase in firm performance. Also, they confirm that financial knowledge and awareness of SME business owners–managers are obviously not a prerequisite for the performance of SMEs, but entrepreneur characteristics in decision-making and relationship to financial attitude have a comparison with financial literacy. The research limitation evolves from cross section information observation that solely covers the southwestern part of the country. Additionally, inspired to meet the analysis gap is panel data analysis. Training courses through strategic orientation on the attitudinal perception of SME business owner–manager and basic business management skills, capacity-building aspect, leadership development as well as networking via relationship marketing and management on financial literacy may have significant effect on SMEs’ performance and growth for the managers in general in Nigeria. The article is one of the first to examine the level of financial literacy of SME business owners–managers in Nigeria. The article therefore sets an important benchmark for further research in this area. © 2017, © 2017 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

AB  - The following skills, such as planning of personal finances, formation and diversification of savings, augmentations of personal capital, and open-mindedness to new initiatives in the entrepreneurship activities, enhance the financial sustainability of the population, and are decisive for their life quality. Every person in certain circumstances can be financially and economically active, if s/he has got such competence as financial literacy which is much more important in the course of life than the level of income or professional qualifications, because, hereafter the governing factor will be not the possession of financial instruments by the person, but skills of effective management for the achievement of one’s own objectives. Knowledge of financial matters at a young age makes administration of finances much easier when becoming adult, getting education, or joining the labor market. At the same time the necessity of improving the financial literacy among young people and educating schoolchildren is more and more discussed. Taking into consideration the fact that young individuals are a significant factor for the development of national economy, substantial improvement of young people’s financial literacy is essential. Young people with a high level of financial literacy would be those who could give greater contribution to state economy, so it is important to research the level of financial literacy among young people. The objective of the present research is to analyze the financial literacy of young people in Daugavpils. Methods used in the research: Monographic method – theoretical description of financial literacy, graphical method – graphical representation of obtained results, interview method (questionnaire) – data acquisition required for the research, statistical method – analysis of statistical information, comparative method – description of the obtained data and drawing conclusions. The financial literacy of Daugavpils youth has been researched and evaluated. The results of the questionnaires show that more than half of respondents have given good estimates of their financial literacy; however, at the same time research results prove that the overall level of financial literacy is not sufficiently high. © 2019 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center.

AB  - This study introduced income mobility analysis using pseudo-longitudinal panel data from Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) to consider the dynamic process of individual's well-being through time. Since there is no comprehensive measurement of income mobility because of its dynamic process, various income mobility indices such as Chi-square, Average Jump Index, Atkinson et al. Mobility Ratio, and Shorrocks’ Mobility Index were used. These indices revealed that Filipino households’ income movements are more mobile than expected, and their income status improved from 2000 to 2015. As income mobility takes place, income inequality is reduced by 91.80 percent (91.80%). Furthermore, the growth effect is the main factor of income mobility. This indicates that households took the economic opportunities from economic growth to earn more. However, income mobility due to transfer effect (transfer of income from one household to another through lottery winning and borrowing) increased when the economy is not good. The higher income mobility due to growth effect compared to transfer effect, whether the economy is good or bad, means that households learned how to use their income in savings, investments, and entrepreneurship. This is the result of a successful financial literacy program of the government wherein households realized financial stability and security. © 2020. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - With this study we explored teachers’ views on the role of economic and management sciences (EMS) in preparing learners for accounting in the Further Education and Training (FET) Phase. A qualitative research approach was employed along with the interpretivist paradigm to underpin the study. We used a qualitative case study approach to allow for an in-depth understanding of the views of the teachers by talking to them directly. Semi-structured individual and focus-group interviews were used as data collection methods. Participants in the study included 5 Grade 9 EMS teachers and 5 Grade 10 accounting teachers who were conveniently and purposively sampled from 5 secondary schools. A thematic analysis approach was adopted to analyse the interview responses. The findings of the study reveal that teachers understood that EMS was an integrated subject. However, Grade 9 teachers struggled to teach EMS in an integrated manner and this hampered the teaching of financial literacy. The challenges in teaching EMS are aggravated by the lack of relevant pedagogical strategies, the lack of adequate knowledge of the subject and missing pertinent foundational content in the EMS curriculum and textbooks. As a result, learners enter the FET phase without being adequately prepared to study accounting in subsequent grades. © 2022, South African Journal Of Education. All rights reserved.

AB  - Faced with impoverishment after the financial crisis of 2008, Filipino women migrants in Italy struggle to sustain their financial commitments to their families in the Philippines. Research shows that financial literacy and entrepreneurship (FLE) education can improve financial management and decision-making processes. Spanning a period of eighteen months, this case study aimed at investigating whether the existing training modules organised by Atikha, the Filipino Women Council and the ALSE OF-LIFE Consortium in Italy have led to changes in the financial attitudes of the thirty-three interviewed Filipinas who attended the programs in the last ten years. This paper seeks to highlight the value of FLE training in promoting the transformative interpretation of individual perspectives in line with Mezirow’s Transformative Learning process. The training programs can be viewed as empowering interventions, capable of contributing to the development of new personal and financial goals. The interviewees’ responses to the in-depth, semi-structured interviews showed that the FLE programs have helped participants critically assess how to develop more productive attitudes towards financial management, and identify sustainable forms of support to their left-behind families. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Research on entrepreneurship education (EE) emphasizes the role of learning environments, contexts and pedagogical choices in developing students’ entrepreneurial competences. EE has assumed that it solely carries the task of improving entrepreneurial competences. Yet, the objectives, content and methods of teaching vary, and hence non-entrepreneurship teachers’ classrooms can also provide a learning environment for entrepreneurial competences. However, whether or not this kind of unintentional teaching of entrepreneurial competences takes place has not been widely addressed. In this study, the authors investigate how business school non-entrepreneurship teachers’ teaching methods unintentionally match the known framework of entrepreneurial competences. The findings indicate that non-entrepreneurship teachers do unintentionally expose their students to entrepreneurial competences such as creativity, learning from experience and financial literacy. However, competences such as opportunity recognition, perseverance and mobilizing resources do not receive similar attention. The findings indicate that some entrepreneurial competences are not solely owned by EE, but can be embedded in non-entrepreneurship education. Accordingly, the study extends the current understanding of EE and which “niche” competences should be emphasized in it, but also demonstrates how non-entrepreneurship teachers can expose students to entrepreneurial competences while teaching in their own subject areas. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - We describe and report the results of an 18-month long training of trainers program in financial literacy and soft skills designed to improve employability of poor and vulnerable Indonesian youth. The program was part of an Inclusive Workforce Development project sponsored by USAID/Indonesia. Twenty-five teachers received training in December 2017 and subsequently conducted 30 trainings for 601 students in West Java from January through May 2018. The training consisted of 18 sessions covering basics of financial literacy and employment–related soft skills. Both participating trainers and students showed statistically significant increases in financial literacy knowledge, and student perceptions about their acquisition of soft skills improved as well. Increases in student financial literacy knowledge were found to relate to prior knowledge, job experience, the type of school they attend, the perceived acquisition of soft skills, and the intention to incorporate the training into their daily lives. Given that the economic education literature links financial literacy to improved worker productivity, decreased absenteeism, and entrepreneurial success, these findings are encouraging for both the students involved and for their employers in Indonesia. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The concept of entrepreneurship has evolved significantly in the last decade and is identified as a competence rather than as a skill, comprising many different behaviours, attributes and skills, including empathy, creativity, financial literacy, taking initiatives and identifying opportunities. The Entrepcomp framework outlined by the EU Commission in 2016 highlighted that entrepreneurship focused on all aspects of society, not just business. It defined entrepreneurship as “the value that is created, financial, cultural, or social”. The importance of entrepreneurship as a key facet of life has reinvented how it should be taught, leading to collaborative pedagogical models that facilitate the exchange, flow and co-creation of knowledge between HEIs, businesses and communities. This article identifies the need for collaborative pedagogical models to develop entrepreneurial skills. It explores if a hybrid of design thinking and problem-based learning can satisfy the needs of entrepreneurship education in contemporary society. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of a financial literacy program (FLP) recently implemented in Jordanian junior high and high schools as part of a national financial literacy agenda on students’ attitudes toward entrepreneurship relative to a control sample of students who had not yet participated in the FLP. This paper also examines the role of moderating variables, including students’ perception of teachers’ attitudes (TA) on students’ entrepreneurial attitudes. Design/methodology/approach: Survey methodology was used to obtain data and hierarchical regression analysis was used to test hypotheses. Findings: Results indicate that students who completed the FLP exhibited significantly higher entrepreneurial awareness than those that had not yet participated in the program. Students who took the entrepreneurship module of the FLP exhibited significantly lower entrepreneurial intention than those that had not yet taken the entrepreneurship module. However, TA did not impact students’ attitudes. Research limitations/implications: The study examines a sample of middle and high school students in only one district in Amman, Jordan, and cannot be generalized to other communities where the FLP has been implemented. Practical implications: The findings provide valuable insights for educators, policymakers and non-governmental organizations considering large scale, publicly funded FLPs as part of the K-12 educational system. Social implications: Stakeholders should consider reforms to the implementation of entrepreneurship education as part of the FLP in Jordanian schools and other developing country K-12 programs. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine the new Jordanian literacy program and the impact it has on attitudes toward entrepreneurship of middle and high school students. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study explores the effects of financial literacy and financial behaviour on entrepreneurial motivation among accounting students in Malaysia’s public universities. University students’ financial literacy level and financial behaviour level are also explored. This study employed a quantitative survey method and used twenty financial items and ten entrepreneurship motivation items to answer the research questions. A total of 530 accounting undergraduates from three public universities in Malaysia were given a financial and entrepreneurial test. To get results, data were analysed using mean and frequency analysis, a reliability test, Pearson’s product-moment analysis and regressions. Our findings demonstrated that the accounting students’ financial literacy and financial behaviour was at a moderate level. However, accounting students possessed a high level of entrepreneurship motivation. Supporting past research, this study found that financial literacy and financial behaviour affect accounting students’ entrepreneurial motivation. This research has valuable implications for educators, higher education and policymakers by designing a more integrated education curriculum and effective policy mechanism that strengthens students’ entrepreneurial motivation. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - South Africa has high youth unemployment. This article examines the predictors of youth employment in rural Agincourt, Mpumalanga Province. A survey of 187 out-of-school 18 to 24 year olds found that only 12% of women and 38% of men were currently employed. Men with skills/training were significantly more likely to report employment, mostly physical labour (adjusted odds ratio: 4.5; confidence interval: 1.3, 15.3). In-depth interviews with 14 of the youth revealed that women are perceived more suitable for formal employment, which is scarce, informing why women were more likely to pursue further education and yet less likely to be employed. Ten key informants from local organisations highlighted numerous local youth employment resources while, in contrast, all youth in the sample said no resources were available, highlighting a need for the organisations to extend their services into rural areas. Because these services are focused on entrepreneurship, programmes to increase financial literacy and formal employment opportunities are also needed. © 2017 Government Technical Advisory Centre (GTAC).

AB  - With the rapid social and economic development, the entrepreneurship skills become more important for the youth to ensure positive development of youth leadership skills. The purpose of this study is to investigate the entrepreneurship skills of urban youth and then develop a model for youth entrepreneurship skills of the community-based leadership training for the urban youth in China. In this study, two methods have been applied: students’ questionnaire survey and the Fuzzy Delphi Method by experts. This study involved 526 students aged 14 to 18 years old in four secondary schools and high schools in Baoding city, Shijiazhuang city, Chengde city and Handan city in Hebei Province for survey. The findings from the survey show that the levels of entrepreneurship skills are still at moderate level. The Fuzzy Delphi Method was conducted to eighteen experts from the fields of education, language, Chinese Studies, accounting and business, and life sciences to get a consensus on youth entrepreneurship skills and related activities. The results demonstrate that there are three categories of skills for the entrepreneurship namely, visiting the local famous enterprises; the lecture activities of successful entrepreneur to share their experiences to make the youth start to learn entrepreneurship; and the activities of financial literacy and personal finance. © 2019, University of Malaya.

AB  - The poor performance of female entrepreneurs, exemplified in their inability to realize their full potential and compete fairly with their male counterparts owing to financial illiteracy, motivated this study. Therefore, this study examined the effect of financial literacy on business performance among female micro-entrepreneurs. Using the survey research design, data were collected from 247 female entrepreneurs from six states in the North-Eastern region of Nigeria. The hypotheses developed for the study were tested using path modeling-structural equation modeling with the aid of SmartPLS software version 3.2.7. The result revealed that all proxies of financial literacy (financial education, cash forecasting, and bookkeeping have significant effects on business performance of female entrepreneurs. Additionally, the paper revealed that financial education contributed more to the variance in business performance of the female micro- entrepreneurs, this was followed by bookkeeping practices, while cash-forecasting has the least effect on the variance in business performance. This implies that financial education is essential for the success of female micro-entrepreneurs. Thus, this study advocates the need for continuing trainings and workshops for female microentrepreneurs on financial concepts such as bookkeeping, cash forecasting, and market volatilities. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

AB  - Micro-entrepreneurs often lack the financial literacy required to make important financial decisions. We conducted a randomized evaluation with a bank in the Dominican Republic to compare the impact of two distinct programs: standard accounting training versus a simplified, rule-of-thumb training that taught basic financial heuristics. The rule-of-thumb training significantly improved firms' financial practices, objective reporting quality, and revenues. For micro-entrepreneurs with lower skills or poor initial financial practices, the impact of the rule-of-thumb training was significantly larger than that of the standard accounting training, suggesting that simplifying training programs might improve their effectiveness for less sophisticated individuals.

AB  - This paper attempts to study the impact of Financial Literacy on Youth Entrepreneurial Intent in Pakistan. A closed-ended self-administered structured questionnaire covering financial literacy, computer knowledge, financial attitude, and financial knowledge with Entrepreneurial Intent was collected from young entrepreneurs. The research tried to investigate the education level with computer skill to inspect the effect of financial literateness on young generation Entrepreneurial Intent in the context of Pakistan. The research model was tested using PLS-SEM and authenticating a measurement model through the advanced methodology and their association with Entrepreneurial Intent. Results revealed that financial literacy and its two parts (financial attitude and financial knowledge) have a positive impact on Entrepreneurial Intent. The size of the joint impact of financial literacy and its components on Entrepreneurial Intent was assessed to be adequate. Entrepreneurial Intent is essential for creating new firms to maintain economic development. Furthermore, it is determined in this research that if youth has better financial knowledge and financial attitude, the probability of Entrepreneurial Intent increases. This suggests that if the youth in Pakistan desire to attain a higher limit of Entrepreneurial Intent, they must implement financial literacy models for enhancing and promoting their current Entrepreneurial Intent. © 2021.

Supply chain management significantly and positively mediates among the relationship between parental income, parental profession, parental education level, and financial literacy. This study used survey methods. The samples of this study were young entrepreneurs or students who started businesses. This study used a different test with smart-PLS. The results of this study showed the differences in the financial literacy of young entrepreneurs based on parental income, parental education level, and parental profession. This study found that young entrepreneurs with high or medium parental income were different from young entrepreneurs with low parental income. Young entrepreneurs with parents attending higher and secondary education were different from entrepreneurs with parents who are only attending elementary school. Young entrepreneurs who have parents as employees and entrepreneurs had no differences in financial, but different when compared to parents who work as laborers. © excelingtech pub, uk.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the association between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success among young entrepreneurs within an economically disadvantaged community in Cape Town, South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The mixed-method approach was adopted for the study. In-depth interviews were used in collecting the qualitative data while structured interviews using questionnaires were administered in collecting the quantitative data. The participants for the study were strictly young entrepreneurs. Findings: The study found that entrepreneurs understood the concept of financial literacy and this was corroborated by their financial literacy average score of 59.03, which is above the national financial literacy average score of 54.00. The study further revealed that a positive association exists between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success. Hence, high levels of financial literacy result in increased business success. Research limitations/implications: The sample size of the study was relatively small, for which reason, a mixed-method approach was adopted to strengthen the research findings. The research also considered only one disadvantaged community in South Africa (Khayelitsha). Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, the influences of financial literacy on the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) among young entrepreneurs have not been well-explored in economically disadvantaged areas within the South African context. As a result, this study sheds light by assessing the level of financial literacy among young entrepreneurs in economically disadvantaged communities and by determining the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success. The study further provides recommendations on policy-making to ensure that through successful entrepreneurship, developmental challenges such as unemployment can be reduced. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Literature has widely studied the financial accountability pressures on NGOs but rarely analysed how NGOs respond to them. This paper studies one large humanitarian NGO to address this question. It investigates the NGO's responses to understand the extent to which NGOs are able to regain control over their own work and turn the frames of evaluation and accountability to their own advantage. Design/methodology/approach: This article draws on a case study of one of the largest French humanitarian NGOs. Interviews and observation (both participant and non-participant) were conducted in the financial department of the NGO. These data are supplemented with field-level contextual interviews. Findings: In the NGO studied, institutional pressure is largely mediated by compliance audits. The paper thus traces the consequences of compliance audits for the NGO's central finance teams and describes how they respond. The findings detail three responses to evaluation. First, to respond to the burden of evaluation, the organisation makes itself auditable and develops preparedness. Second, to respond to the anxiety of evaluation, the organisation engages in a process of purification and succumbs to the allure of the single figure. Third, building on its newly acquired auditability and purity, the organisation performs itself as a “corporatised NGO”. Together, these three responses constitute the NGO as an “entrepreneur” competing for eligibility, and financial literacy and managerialism become crucial to respond to pressure from institutional funders. Originality/value: This paper extends the understanding of organisational responses to evaluation. The authors show the influence of evaluation systems on NGOs, but also how NGOs can react to regain control over their work and turn the frames of evaluation and accountability to their own advantage. However, despite several decades of calls for broader conceptions of NGO accountability, the case NGO prefers to promote a very narrow view of its performance, based solely on accounting compliance. It takes some pride in its ability to comply with funders' and auditors' demands. Turning a simple matter of compliance into a display of good performance, it builds a strategy and competitive advantage on its ability to respond competently to evaluation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Internet consumer finance platforms (ICFPs), as a new Internet financial model, have emerged and been widely adopted by Chinese as well as global online shoppers following the rapid growth of e-commerce. This emerging financial tool is, however, luring younger generations deep into debt. It jeopardizes the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1—No poverty, bringing the sustainability of this consumer financial model into question. To aid the sustainable development of ICFP industry, this paper distinguishes two antecedents of continuous use intention for ICFP users: (1) satisfaction, as a sustainable determinant; and (2) impulsive buying, as a non-sustainable determinant. We found satisfaction (b = 0.452) has a larger positive effect on continuous use intention compared to impulsive buying (b = 0.229). Therefore, ICFPs should weigh heavier on technology innovation instead of seducing consumers’ impulsive buying behavior. We also found that credit limit misconception poses the largest impact (b = 0.483) on impulsive buying. In the near term, governments and ICFPs may initiate public programs to improve ICFP users’ financial literacy in order to restrain their unsustainable impulsive buying behavior and cultivate their sustainable satisfaction on ICFP technology and service. Market regulators may build up institutional frameworks to tighten the abuse of financial platforms on credit issuing power and better foster sustainable entrepreneurship in this new financial platform business. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The limited attention given to financial education in the development of student competencies can undermine the decision making of individuals in their adulthood. This circumstance has been widely studied in the literature, where the effect of financial literacy on creative entrepreneurship is influenced. The objective of this study is to analyze global research trends on the effect of financial education and financial literacy with the creativity of individual entrepreneurship. For this, a bibliometric analysis was carried out on 665 documents related to the subject of study during 1990–2018 period. The results show the most influential journals, authors, institutions, countries, and areas of knowledge on this scientific research. This work detects the main trends and patterns to offer a vision of the relationship between financial education and creative entrepreneurship. It should be noted that this research area has become a relevant field of study in education, finance, business, and management issues. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to measure the relationship between developing entrepreneurial leaders and their successful performance in business simulation. At Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), learners do Strategic Management and business simulation courses during the third year of their Bachelor's degree. By the time they do the business simulation course, they will already have taken at least one or two courses in each of marketing, management, accounting, business statistics, international business, finance and innovation and entrepreneurship. These students already have an introductory exposure to the main concepts that comprise the business core. Theoretically, they are ready to test their knowledge, understanding and skills at the applied learning level. Thus business simulation is seen as a capstone course for the business-core courses. For this study, comparative performance metrics in the student group project, student self-reflective statements, overall placement in the simulation game and total shareholder return of a simulated mobile phone company are matched to the data visualisation graphics. Data visualisation is enabled by KH Coder, an unsupervised machine learning, quantitative text-analysis process. Technologies used in the analysis include correlation co-occurrence networks, centrality co-occurrence networks and multidimensional scaling. A linkage is struck between high performance in the business simulation course via a set of metrics and the visual content of the graphics, representing students' understanding of the simulation. The high performing teams in the simulation-those who best modelled overall competitive and financial success in the game-exhibited a unique pattern of understanding. Using a pattern-matching approach, a clear data structure emerges that separates high-performing teams from their competitors. This study documents success via modelling innovation and entrepreneurship through participation in strategic management and business simulation courses. The results highlight the importance of learner participation in overall innovation and entrepreneurship education, and the financial literacy gained from participating in business simulation. While business simulation is currently a hot topic, limited research is available from the Middle East connecting entrepreneurship and innovation to success in business simulation. This study takes a data analytics approach to demonstrate the value of participating in business simulation. There is a strong connection between performing well in business simulation and the unique pattern that emerges from the data analytics of the text of what students feel they have learned. © 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the attitudes to entrepreneurship of Italian households, focusing on the importance of financial literacy and digital skills as potentially relevant factors shaping entrepreneurship. We put the gender focus to our analysis to detect whether, and to what extent, women and men differ in their propensity to run a business. We carry out our research by using the Bank of Italy SHIW dataset for the years 2008 and 2010. Our findings suggest a strong heterogeneity between men and women in the role played by financial literacy and digital skills. Results show a positive and significant correlation between financial literacy and the probability of being an entrepreneur but only for men. We also find that digitally skilled male respondents are much more likely to be entrepreneurs. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article examines some of the complexities associated with developing financially literate, enterprising young Australians through school education. We aimed to explore what seems to influence students in pricing goods for sale within their school community. Data were collected from more than 300 years 5 and 6 students (10–12 years of age) in four government primary schools in urban Darwin. Students were asked to respond to problem contexts involving fundraising as an example of an enterprise activity. The findings reveal that familiarity with fundraising initiatives, personal values, and language and literacy skills shaped the responses students gave. Students who gave loss-making and break-even responses were price conscious, but also tended to confuse terminology influencing mathematisation—i.e., “cost”, “price” and “profit”. Students who gave profit-making responses applied reasoning that was mathematical, financial and entrepreneurial, giving explanations that distinguished between these terms. We argue that these insights contribute to our understanding how upper primary school students interpret and respond to financial problems, with useful implications for schools and teachers. © 2018, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.

AB  - This exploratory mixed methods study sought to determine the financial capabilities of remittance-receiving households from two rural municipalities in the Philippines: San Nicolas in Ilocos Norte province and Moncada in Tarlac province. The broader concept of financial capabilities not only looks at people’s financial literacy but also their financial inclusion (access to financial products) and financial functionings (actions on finance). Quantitative household surveys and qualitative data gathering methods that fall under a rapid qualitative inquiry (RQI) design were employed. Results and findings show that more remittance-receiving households from San Nicolas saved, invested, and did business in their hometown compared to counterpart migrant household respondents from Moncada. Differences in migrant households’ levels of financial literacy, as well as the geographic make-up and economic activities of the two municipalities, may help explain why one municipality had more migrant investors, savers, and entrepreneurs over the other. © Scalabrini Migration Center 2021.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of Consciousness personality on women entrepreneurs’ behavioral biases by focusing on financial literacy which is taken as a mediator while the mindfulness as a potential moderator. A random sample of 210 female entrepreneurs working in Pakistan was collected through stratified sampling technique and data are analyzed by using Structural Equation Modeling through SMART-PLS. The results divulged a significant mediating impact of financial literacy in reducing mental accounting bias among consciousness personality possessing women entrepreneurs; however, financial literacy was found related to the risk aversion bias through mindfulness. The moderation analysis further revealed interesting indirect impacts, such that financial literacy strongly reduced mental accounting and risk aversion bias for women who were more conscious of proper financial mindfulness. Nonetheless, financial mindfulness did not catalyze financial literacy and herding bias relationship. By encompassing the concepts of financial literacy, mindfulness, and behavioral biases in consciousness personality’s women entrepreneurs, we offered a comprehensive theoretical framework with practical implications for women entrepreneurs in Pakistan. Thus, we suggest new avenues for the longstanding dilemma related to the factors instigating suboptimal financial decision-making in women entrepreneurs in developing markets. © 2022 K. J.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of entrepreneurship on the efficiency of household financial portfolios by constructing Sharpe ratios and Sortino ratios of seven kinds of financial assets, based on data from the 2013, 2015 and 2017 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), in conjunction with the returns of the financial asset index of China from 2010 to 2018. Employing CRE regressions, Heckman two-stage models and PSM methods, we find that undertaking entrepreneurship helps to increase the efficiency of household portfolios significantly. This study also verifies that entrepreneurial households improve their portfolio efficiency through financial information by testing the moderating effects of social network, business experience and financial literacy. In addition, this study shows that entrepreneurial households generally adopt a less diversified strategy in asset allocation than do non-entrepreneurial households. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate success factors pertinent to the management of Indigenous businesses through the identification of points of intervention at the systemic and structural levels. Through this approach, the economic and social values that First Nations communities attach to intangible Indigenous cultural heritage (ICH) and Indigenous cultural intellectual property (ICIP) may be both recognised and realised as assets. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a multidisciplinary approach to address a global issue of economic and social significance to First Nation peoples, their businesses and the Australian Aboriginal communities. The authors adopt a First Nation epistemological standpoint that incorporates theoretical perspectives drawn from a diverse range of fields and theories (Preston, 2013), as well as advocate the use of Indigenist methodology for research with First Nation peoples as it is underpinned by critical race theory. Findings: The authors argue conceptually that accounting, accountability and auditing consideration are required to fully identify what is impacting the successful management of Indigenous enterprises. Specifically, in relation to accounting, Elders should be included to assist in valuing the intangible ICH and ICIP assets. Furthermore, the authors emphasise the need to improve the financial and commercial literacy levels of Indigenous entrepreneurs. Practical implications: The authors prescribe the use of tools for the accounting treatment of ICH and ICIP as intangible assets within an Australian regulatory environment and define an auditing process and accountability model incorporating cultural, social and environmental measures. A central tenet of this model relates to improving levels of personal and commercial financial literacy in the First Nation participants. Collectively, these factors promote informed participation and decision-making, and may promulgate more sustainable outcomes. Social implications: Integrated thinking requires all these factors to be considered in a holistic manner, such that a First Nation enterprise and the wider Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can understand, and make decisions based on, the overall impact it has on all their stakeholders and generally on the society, the environment and the economy. Originality/value: This paper contributes to Australia’s strategic research priorities of maximising social and economic participation in society and improving the health and well-being of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The authors address the inability of current Western accounting standards, practices and models to suitably account for communally held and protocol-bound intangible Indigenous cultural heritage and Indigenous cultural intellectual property assets. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Financial literacy is defined as the knowledge, skills, and ability to navigate increasingly complex financial markets, and is considered to empower consumers to make responsible financial decisions. It has been widely promoted as a crucial life skill following the 2008 financial crisis. This study critically analyzes financial literacy education initiatives in Turkey through ethnographic research. Financial literacy curricula provide the basic knowledge of finance as well as instruct subjects ways to conduct financial planning, budgeting, debt management, creditworthiness, saving, and investment. Financial literacy agenda deepens neo-liberal governmentality by promoting an entrepreneurial subjectivity and making individuals more aware and responsible for social risks. The cultural political economy perspective of this study analyzes financialized capital accumulation dynamics together with the reshaping of culture and the constitution of financialized subjectivities. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify and explore the role of Islamic financing in supporting development of halal industry in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: This research is divided into two studies. The first study uses survey-based quantitative method and the second study uses focus group discussion (FGD) method. Using a purposive and proportional sampling technique in the first study, this research collected 1,985 samples of Islamic financial products of business owners (demand-side) from all parts of Indonesia. The data were analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modeling approach. The authors also conducted FGDs, involving 35 participants from government, financial, social and education institutions (supply-side) as well as business owners (demand-side) in three separated times. Findings: In the first study, it can be identified that literacy on Islamic finance, attitude and awareness strongly affect business owners’ intention to use Islamic financial products. It is also found that subjective norm significantly influences literacy, attitude and awareness. Interestingly, religiosity does not significantly affect attitude toward Islamic financial products. According to the FGD in the second study, this research generates several factors motivating business owners’ preference to choose conventional rather than Islamic financial products, including expensive pricing, less developed technology, bad service quality and the halal status of the products. The reason for insignificant results of religiosity on attitude in the first study is explained in the second study. Most users are utilitarians who mainly perceived the products based on the sought benefits provided by the products. Practical implications: This research offers the government a road map showing the strategy to build Islamic financial ecosystem in Indonesia. The road map integrates supply-side, which includes government, financial industries, social and education institutions and scientific organizations, and demand-side, which includes business owners or entrepreneur associations. Originality/value: This research provides a wide range of samples derived from business owners’ respondents of halal industry in all representative islands in Indonesia. Therefore, it gives more holistic and representative findings. In addition, the analysis in this research covers not only the demand-side but also the supply-side perspective. Lastly, this research provides an Islamic financial ecosystem model that integrates all stakeholders to improve halal industry performance as a whole. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Low business outlook due to poor financial decisions among students has continued to attract interest of financial educators and professionals. Previous studies have interrogated financial literacy with sparse attention given to business risk-taking among students' start-ups in Nigeria. This research gap forms the basis of this study. The aim of this paper is the interrogation of financial knowledge and financial behavior as a lever for business risk-taking among start-up students of the University of Lagos, Nigeria. The philosophical perspective drew insight from the positivist approach with a random sampling of 145 final-year students selected from the departments of Business Administration, Accounting and Employment, and Labour Relations of the Faculty of Management Sciences. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and Bartlett's test were conducted to determine sample adequacy. Regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. The results show that financial knowledge and behavior of start-ups revealed a high propensity to be engaged in business risk-taking (β = .407, t (511) = 7.556, p < 0.05; β = .412, t (1.511) = 7.525, p < 0.05) with males showing more financial literacy understanding for business risk than females (β = .591, t (2;510) = 4.381, p < 0.05; β = .280, t (2;510) = 2.217, p = 0.262) respectively. The findings show the need for the continuous development of students' start-up behavioral and attitudinal disposition, especially females in becoming more financial literate for appropriate financial decision-making in business risk-taking and venture creation. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

AB  - This article analyses the impact of an entrepreneur’s financial literacy upon innovation within small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and, in so doing, extends human capital theory to consider the effect of financial literacy on risky investment decisions. Using a large survey dataset of Chinese SMEs in 2015 and 2017, our findings suggest that financial literacy is positively associated with innovation; positive relationships are robust to different innovation metrics. In addition, we find that gender matters, as male owners appear to promote more innovations, while firm size is positively associated with innovation. Additional analysis suggests that risk tolerance is a transmission mechanism for the impact of financial literacy on innovation. Our results corroborate previous studies showing that individuals with greater financial literacy make sound personal financial decisions and so have important public policy implications. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The Philippine microenterprises sector is considered as an important stimulus of the country’s economic growth. Previous studies have cited that the struggles faced by micro and small entrepreneurs are brought about by the difficulty in access to finance and the lack of entrepreneurs’ financial literacy and inadequate business acumen. Anchored on the resource-based view theory, the primary objective of this study is to determine the role of financial sophistication, as a human capital resource, and its components, on the link between the strategy–sustainability indicator relationship. Based on a study of 384 micro-entrepreneurs from the National Capital Region, results of the partial least squares–structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) showed that business strategy is positively linked to each of the sustainability indicators, that is, economic, environmental, social, and governance. Conversely, the entrepreneur’s financial sophistication increases the effect of business strategy on each of the sustainability indicators. The results of the study also showed that a positive financial behavior and decision-making style are significant components of financial sophistication. © 2020, Asia-Pacific Social Science Review.

AB  - An entrepreneur is often driven by a quest for innovation and creativity in a market, thus creating competition. The competition will create wealth, leading to improved living standards for individuals and the economy at large. Moreover, innovation and creation result in new and superior products that enable modern markets to be developed. However, the enthusiasm to become an entrepreneur is not the sole driving factor. One must know the importance of financial literacy. Besides, the negative stigma due to the COVID-19 pandemic ruined many lives and impacted businesses with less money due to the reduction of clientele; also, it had impacted budding entrepreneurs (at early start-up stages, and hardly have had experience between 1-3 years) with fewer opportunities to make money. That reduced the willingness of entrepreneurs to invest capital in the business due to raging losses. The current article presents the importance of financial literacy for budding entrepreneurs. To find and measure the financial literacy among budding entrepreneurs, the data were distributed to 223 entrepreneurs; however, 179 were finally used for analysis due to several reasons mentioned in the research methodology. The data was collected from five districts of the South region of India (Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu) and the snowball technique is used in the analysis. The study revealed that most budding entrepreneurs lack proper financial literacy. The study found that Financial Skills, Financial Knowledge, Financial Attitude, Social Interactions & Past Experiences, Financial Support & Guidance directly influenced Financial Literacy levels among entrepreneurs. The study also suggests that aspiring entrepreneurs should be given practical financial training sessions; it should be made mandatory. © Universal Journal of Accounting and Finance 2021.

AB  - This paper is not an indictment of Black banks and financial institutions, but it pre-sents the difficulties and failures of such minority businesses. Unfortunately, some African Americans are naïve when it comes to banking, primarily because of a lack of financial literacy; and such education is not taught in our schools. Of course, financial education is the key for Black patrons who have never had a bank account. Whether this means that African Americans should only bank with Black financial institutions is important to understand, because of the racial disparities and flat-out discrimination when it comes to banking credit and providing business, home, and personal loans to Black banking clientele. In this regard, traditional white banks in the United States simply upset the financial apple-cart, to use the metaphor, when it comes to fairly deal-ing with Black people—that is, lending to Black entrepreneurs and legitimate borrow-ers. With the failure of Black banks, because of a lack of capital and high net-worth individuals and white investors, it has been extremely hard for many of these venerable institutions to hang-on when providing maximum loan possibilities needed over the years (sometimes more than necessary). © 2022, Polish Academy of Sciences - Institute of Philosophy and Sociology.

AB  - We explore the interaction effects of financial literacy and risk aversion on becoming an entrepreneur. We use two independent datasets to provide evidence that the difference in risk aversion between entrepreneurs and wage earners is conditional on their financial literacy. First, we use the De Nederlandsche Bank’s Household Survey and find lower risk aversion only for entrepreneurs with lower financial literacy. The difference disappears for entrepreneurs with higher financial literacy. Second, we show that the results are robust in a fully incentivized field experiment with high-tech startups from three European countries. The results reveal a potential channel of how financial literacy can promote entrepreneurship. © 2020 International Council for Small Business.

AB  - The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between financial literacy, firm’s growth, and access to finance among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) within Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. This study tries to find out whether financial literacy affects a firm’s access to finance and growth. To get an insight of the relationship, quantitative research was carried out among 41 SMEs of Jaipur, Rajasthan, India. The findings from the study are based on quantitative data collected through the use of semi-structured questionnaires. Findings reveal a positive correlation among the variables i.e. financial literacy, access to finance and firm’s growth. Both financial literacy and access to finance have a substantial impact on firms’ growth. This study contributes to the existing literature by justifying the role of financial literacy in the strategic decision-making process. Financial literacy not only enables the entrepreneur in decision making but also helps SMEs to develop economies. Furthermore, as SMEs play a key role in developing countries, it becomes imperative for the entrepreneurs to be sound in financial decision making which also affects the performance of the firm.

AB  - Leadership and career readiness are important goals for youth development. Entrepreneurship has recently been considered as a potential intervention to support these aims. This study examined a venture development program for low-income youth through participant surveys (n = 57) and a comparison group (n = 72). Findings from structural equation modeling indicate relationships between the program and project management skills, which in turn was associated with youth leadership. Findings also showed relationships between the program and financial literacy, which was associated with an increase in future orientation. This study shows early evidence of entrepreneurship and venture creation as mechanisms to support marginalized youth. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Rural women have long found entrepreneurial opportunities by way of associating with Self Help Groups. Although the numbers are quite meagre, women are increasingly being driven to take up small business activities for economic upliftment. The support of the State machinery by way of social welfare schemes has been crucial in this regard as right from the formation of the group to sanctioning of credit facilities from public sector banks. However, much of this is on papers and appears in various government reports. The activities undertaken by these women have been in sectors like traditional horticulture processing, dairy, handicraft etc. While they understand the core activity undertaken by them, their banking literacy and access to credit facilities required to run the business has been a cause of concern. This study through a survey conducted across 200 women SHG members across 4 districts in Uttarakhand aims to explore the three key areas-levels of bank credit literacy among SHG women i.e., how well they understand the basic modalities of a bank loan and more so about the loans taken by them, accessibility-how easier is it to avail bank credit at rural public sector bank branches and the quality of service-whether they are satisfied with the service of their financing bank. The study reveals that while NGOs have played a great role in linking rural women to banks and inculcating banking habits, financial literacy regarding credit facilities still remain a concern. In the SHG mode, most of the members are aware about the financing schemes launched by the Government through Bank, NGOs and government officials. However, they are still not confident of dealing independently with banks for credit facility. Majority of the members do not have information regarding defaults in loan payments, financial position of the group's business and subsidy amount receivable in their loan accounts or even the repayment period of the loan. Service quality of banks have been judged as satisfactory by far perhaps due to the fact that most of the time they visit the banks with NGO representatives. This study brings out the target areas for better financial awareness among rural micro entrepreneurs so that they can manage businesses more effectively. © 2018, Allied Business Academies.

Given the fact that the number of business units from the micro, small and medium enterprises group far exceeds the number of business units of large business groups, it can be said that the contribution of small businesses to the relatively large growth of gross domestic income is due to the large number of units, not because high level of business performance. From the results of the study found a significant relationship between entrepreneurial motivation, entrepreneurial competence, and financial literacy on the performance of micro, small and medium enterprises in the city of Kupang. © 2020 IJSTR.

AB  - Over the past few years, startups have been seen as a taste of the season for India. This has resulted into the materialization of a number of home grown new companies across the country. This development of a novel scenario has been due to the major contributions that led to the mega funding ploughed into most of these new companies between 2007 and 2015. This paper represented the growth of startup companies in India, their types, and possible sources of financing with special emphasis on financing these ventures in the country. In this research, we examined the defining stages of development for startups as well as their funding sources at each stage. The objective of this research paper was to investigate whether India made a shift from conventional to the modern methods of financing. Therefore, this research can be helpful in superior understanding about the funding strategies of entrepreneurial ventures. For conducting the research, a total of five states, that is, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh were taken into consideration. This paper is primarily based on survey questionnaires, and the chi-square test was adopted to ascertain the results derived from the information gathered from the respondents. The results revealed that there is an urgent need to provide financial literacy to startups and increase awareness on the activities of angel/VC financing through greater involvement with educational/research institutions and incubation centres. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

AB  - Purpose: It is imperative to offer a new perspective of Entrepreneurial Growth Intention (EGI) that draws directly upon the capability approach. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of capabilities in the context of EGI in the floriculture industry in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach: The study was exploratory and is mainly qualitative in nature. In-depth interviews were carried out with the owners of farms who possess experience in floriculture commercial cultivation in Sri Lanka. Findings: The results emerged that there are different perspectives among farm owners regarding EGI. Drawing attention on the stories of our participants and making a three-phase analysis, we identified 31 key actions denoted by the farm owners. This work then suggests that the seven capabilities might be fruitfully framed around EGI. Research limitations/implications: As the results stress the role of capabilities in the formation of an entrepreneur's growth intention is vital. Therefore, more targeted measures should be drawn to build fair and supportive facilities to obtain advanced knowledge, to familiarise with the emergence of technology and to attain professional services specifically in financial literacy. Originality/value: The question of what factors influence EGI at the farm level is still largely unexplored as less is known about the effect of capabilities on EGI. The study expands the current debates on EGI and institutional environment, which allows the mapping out of capability development. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Entrepreneurship contributes to the economic well-being of every country. Specifically, the level of individual entrepreneurship is crucial in the process of developing and building economic potential, especially in Central European countries. Among the several factors impacting entrepreneurship, the ability to access the necessary external sources of financing need to be considered crucial. The financial literacy of the entrepreneur plays a crucial role in the relationship between the lender and the borrower. In this paper, we investigate the effects of financial literacy on sustainable entrepreneurship. We based our analysis on the framework proposed by the World Economic Forum. We present an OLS model that adopts entrepreneurship, financial literacy and macroeconomic variables. The analysis is carried out on individual and national data from different sources of information (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, World Bank, and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development). The results show a positive and statistically significant relationship between financial literacy and sustainable entrepreneurial activity. This evidence supports the increasing number of financial education initiatives and the inclusion of topics related to economic and financial culture in school education systems. We identify internationally valid policy implications. In the context of the growth strategies of Central European countries, financial literacy takes on even greater importance. The introduction of financial education in the national curricula could strengthen entrepreneurial skills and accelerate the inclusive growth process across Europe. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine empirically the determinants of owner manager financial self-confidence. In particular, it estimates the effect of bank credit rejection and financial education (FE) on the financial self-confidence of business owners. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses data from 2004 and 2008 surveys of 2,500 UK small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). An ordered probit estimation is used to measure and assess the effect of bank credit rejection and FE variables on financial self-confidence for the two periods. The authors also explore potential differences in self-confidence between males and females. Findings: The results show that outright bank credit rejection reduces financial self-confidence among owner managers whereas partial bank credit rejection is found to help boost confidence prior to the financial crisis. There is strong evidence that FE increases financial self-confidence. Finally, the authors find no association between gender and reported self-confidence in finance. Research limitations/implications: Entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs are encouraged to explore financial literacy and knowledge with a view to increasing their financial self-confidence. This will help SMEs to deal with the banks or other finance providers more efficiently. In addition, better application procedures and information on lending criteria may help SMEs to minimize the probability of bank credit rejection. So the current study has implications for professional bodies as well. The study, however, is restricted to sole proprietor and partnership SMEs and in the UK context only. Practical implications: Financial self-confidence has a progressive effect on entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial venture growth. The financial self-confidence of owner managers can support their entrepreneurial capability in starting and operating one or more businesses. As entrepreneurs successfully start and operate their own businesses, they are contributing to economic development through job creation, employment and tax contribution. Originality/value: This paper makes an original contribution in highlighting the usefulness of FE in boosting financial self-confidence among entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs. It is also found that the experience of bank credit rejection reduces entrepreneurs’ financial self-confidence. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In this paper, we study the relationship between financial literacy and self-employment. We use established financial literacy questions to measure literacy levels. The analysis shows a highly significant and positive correlation between the index and self-employment. We address the direction of causality by applying instrumental variable techniques based on information about maternal education. We also exploit information on financial support and family background to account for concerns about the exclusion restriction. The results provide support for a positive effect of financial literacy on the probability of being self-employed. As financial literacy is acquirable, the findings suggest that entrepreneurial activities might be increased by enhancing financial literacy.

AB  - This study examines the effects of the three proposed financial sophistication dimensions, that is, (1) knowledge; (2) behavior, and (3) decision-making style, on the triple bottom line (TBL) framework. Based on a sample of 384 micro-entrepreneurs across the National Capital Region (NCR) in the Philippines, results of PLS-SEM showed that the financial decision-making style had a positive effect on all areas of the TBL. Financial behavior showed to have positive effects on the economic and environmental aspects while financial knowledge only had a positive effect on the economic bottom line. Lastly, the relationship between female micro-entrepreneurs’ financial decision-making style and the economic bottom line was found to be significantly higher than that of male micro-entrepreneurs. Implications of these findings were also discussed. © 2019 by De La Salle University.

AB  - Training programmes are popular development interventions that aim to address problems of youth unemployment. This paper estimates the impact of a youth entrepreneurship programme in Tanzania on financial literacy and employment knowledge. Using primary data within a successive cohort design in a community-led programme, the authors employed propensity score matching and fixed-effect estimation methods to assess changes in knowledge, skills and attitudes of marginalised youth. They found strong positive effects of the programme on key intermediate employment outcomes: savings ability, employment confidence and personal finance. The positive impact of this programme supports youth entrepreneurship training programme and non-experimental evaluation methods. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The need for making optimal financial decisions is very important in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) especially as most SMEs are always financially constrained. Consequently, there has been an increasing interest from researchers to determine how well financial literacy skills can enable entrepreneurs to make decisions that result in optimal financial outcomes and possible enhance the performance and growth of their businesses. This study had as objectives to find out the impact of financial literacy on firm performance, as well as to examine the moderating effect of financial capital availability on the financial literacy - performance relationship, amongst SME in the Free State province of South Africa. The results showed that on average SME have low levels of financial literacy and financial capital availability. It was also observed that financial literacy positively influenced SME performance, and that the relationship is positively moderated by financial capital availability. It is, therefore, necessary for SME owners to develop financial literacy skills as an essential part of entrepreneurial activities. Likewise, since businesses rely on financial capital to invest, develop and grow, policy makers should put in place measures on how to bridge the access to finance gap, and, thus, ensure that entrepreneurs are relieved from financing constraints. © Neneh Brownhilder Ngek, 2016.

AB  - This paper proposes a new service system that explains the process of social innovation (SI) in education in a developing country. We selected 17 Ashoka cases in the field of education in Bangladesh and analyzed them thematically. Results show that targets for SI (educational opportunities, employment opportunities, and additional educational resources) are related to the first phase of SI where social entrepreneurs foster innovative ideas that effectively solve social problems. Results also reveal that support for innovation is related to the second phase of SI, in which the SI becomes a social norm. Applying the process, the paper proposes a design of a new SI through the application of massive open online courses (MOOCs) to teach financial literacy to poor people.

AB  - This study aims at investigating the financial knowledge, financial behaviour and the attitude towards finance amongst on small medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) in Kuching. More specifically on how these powerful factors affect the profitability on fast growing business enterprises in largest city in the Borneo Island over the last decade. The research takes a descriptive approach fitting its underlying pursue and draws interesting conclusions with over 75% response rate. Analysis of the data collected clearly reveals that the knowledge of finance in general relates significantly stronger to the bottom line of these business entities relative to the owners’ financial attitude and their ensuing behaviour towards financial decision making.

AB  - Orientation: In this ever-changing business milieu, poverty alleviation has turned into an important issue after the publication of the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, which aim at eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions by 2030. Research purpose: This study investigates the effect of entrepreneurship education, budgeting financial literacy and access to credit facilities on entrepreneurial performance and poverty reduction. Motivation for the study: There is a lack of literature that studies the effect of entrepreneurship education, budgeting financial literacy and access to credit facilities on entrepreneurial performance and poverty reduction in an emerging economy, such as South Africa. Research design, approach and method: The study adopted a quantitative approach. The examination was completed in the Vhembe District of Limpopo province, South Africa, where many people live in poverty. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 150 managers of rural small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To test the hypothesised model, structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis was employed using the Smart partial least squares (PLS) software. Main findings: The findings uncovered that entrepreneurship education, budgeting financial literacy and access to credit facilities positively impact entrepreneurial performance of SMEs and reduce poverty. Practical/managerial implications: The present research provides theoretical implications for academics in the field of entrepreneurship, precisely, by enhancing an understanding of the link between entrepreneurship education, budgeting financial literacy, access to credit facilities, entrepreneurship performance and poverty reduction. On the practitioners’ side, this work offers avenues for SME managers to improve entrepreneurial ventures and eventually eliminate household poverty. Moreover, this study also offers policy implications. Existing policies, for example, can be updated, with the goal of improving entrepreneurial performance of SMEs and reducing poverty. Contribution/value-add: This article provides useful insights into and suggestions on the way forward. Furthermore, it contributes to the existing knowledge base in the field of entrepreneurship. As such, this research is important for SME managers because most of them endeavour to enhance entrepreneurial performance and alleviate poverty in their communities. © AOSIS (pty) Ltd.

AB  - The primary purpose of the current study is to investigate the entrepreneurial self-efficacy as an antecedent to persistency among entrepreneurs. In addition to that, the study examines the mediating role of entrepreneurial passion between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and the entrepreneurial persistence. Lastly, the study explored the relationship between financial literacy and persistence and its moderating role between entrepreneurial passion and the persistence. Structural equation modeling by means of partial least square bootstrapping resampling was used for hypotheses testing to analyze the data collected from a sample of 273 Malaysian entrepreneurs. The results of the study supported all arguments broached in current research for the subjective norm, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, which showed a significant impact on entrepreneurial passion and entrepreneurial persistency. The moderating effect of financial literacy on entrepreneurial passion and entrepreneurial persistency was also highly significant. The current work is among the pioneering studies that examines entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial passion, financial literacy and entrepreneurial persistence among entrepreneurs. © 2019, Czestochowa University of Technology.

AB  - The research assessed whether progress has been made in the education and development of financial awareness in Hungary since 2016. We reviewed the changes in the state's role in the development of financial literacy, and in a questionnaire survey we examined what kind of organizations, who and in what topics are involved in trainings outside the public education. It was found that between 2016 and 2020, there was an increasing focus on developing the financial literacy, while the vast majority of the trainings continues to target the most easily reachable school age group. The National Core Curriculum identified economic and financial education as a goal for schools. However, outside of vocational high schools, such knowledge is not taught as a compulsory subject. In 2017, the Government adopted a strategy to improve the financial awareness of the population, and the first accredited financial literacy textbooks were published. The results of non-public education organisations show that the number of training programs and their participants has tripled. The average duration of trainings has become longer, multi-day trainings mainly for adults appeared. Knowledge transfer continued to focus on individual frugality and financial awareness, financial self-knowledge, attitude, and behaviour. The education of investment and entrepreneurship knowledge still isn't a priority. Most of the trainings do not take into account the income situation and social background of the target groups and do not pay attention to the development of financially vulnerable groups. © 2020 Southern Scientific Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

AB  - This paper discusses the issues of improving the financial literacy of crisis managers. In a market economy, small and medium-sized enterprises are faced with constant changes that can lead enterprises to liquidation. Companies use crisis management to solve immediate problems in a crisis period. The formation of the financial literacy of a crisis manager will contribute to the growth of the effectiveness of its activities. The relevance of the topic of crisis management in small business is due to the presence of problems with profit-making by small entrepreneurs due to the opening of large store chains, even in small towns. Our state needs to take into account all segments of the population, those who can buy products in large chain stores, as well as those who can only come to a store that is nearby and buy the most necessary things for the near future. That is why small business should exist along with big business and also successfully extract the maximum profit from its activities. The purpose of this work is to study the development of crisis management in small businesses, in particular, its application in practice in Russia. © 2019, Research Trend. All rights reserved.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the economic growth of Indonesia. Government regulations to limit large-scale social activities has caused marketing and financial difficulties for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Digital and financial literacy have the potential to overcome the problems. This study attempts to identify the determinants of MSME sustainability during the pandemic. By using a questionnaire, this study collected 204 data from MSMEs for further analyses. MSME sustainability is influenced by the digital and financial literacy of MSME owners and is a cause for concern. The implementation of health and safety measures (HSM) has an insignificant impact on business sustainability, but HSM affects financial and digital literacy. Entrepreneurial skills are important to improve HSM and owners’ digital and financial literacy. The government and other parties need to provide more soft loans and facilitate MSMEs to develop entrepreneurial skills, digital and financial literacy to improve business sustainability during the pandemic. © 2022 AESS Publications.

AB  - Although the increasing adoption of digital finance in recent years has exerted a wide-ranging influence on farmers’ consumption and production activities, many farmers in China still seriously suffer from digital financial exclusion. Few studies have documented the different impacts of e-commerce adoption characterized by online purchases and sales on farmers’ participation in the digital financial market measured by their engagement in digital payments, digital wealth management, and digital credit in rural China. Using survey data from 832 entrepreneurial households in rural China, we contribute to the literature by confirming that both online purchases and sales have a robust significant and positive impact on farmers’ participation in the digital financial market and that this impact on digital wealth management is successively larger than that on digital payments and digital credit, with the propensity score matching (PSM) method and instrument variable (IV) approach employed. We further discover that the impact of online purchases and sales on farmers’ participation in the digital financial market is significantly mediated by digital financial literacy. Moreover, the impact of online purchases and sales on farmers’ participation in the digital financial market is larger for those with high education levels, pursuing skills training, running new agricultural operation entities (i.e., family farms, professional cooperatives), and engaging in agricultural entrepreneurship. Our findings suggest that more effective measures to enhance adoption rates of online purchases and sales, innovation in rural market-oriented digital financial products and services, systematic training for farmers in e-commerce skills as well as digital financial literacy, and differentiated support measures for different groups of farmers to reduce the gap are urgently needed in China. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurial activities, and the moderating effects of industrial regulation in the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the role of financial literacy on entrepreneurial participation and performance is investigated through multi-sourced data from the Chinese Family Panel Studies with manually merged provincial and industrial data from 2014. Four hypotheses are tested based on Probit and Tobit models. Moreover, instrumental variable method and principal component analysis are applied to provide robustness checks. Findings: The empirical results demonstrate that financial literacy has significantly positive effects on entrepreneurial participation, as well as on entrepreneurial performance. In addition, industrial regulation positively moderates the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurial participation and performance, which indicates that financial literacy plays a more important role in promoting entrepreneurship in tightly regulated industries. Originality/value: This study proposes and tests the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurial activities, which fills an important gap in the literature. The results in this paper provide evidence that financial literacy has positive impacts in both the entry and operation stages of entrepreneurship. This evidence provides theoretical foundations for policy making in popularizing financial knowledge and supporting entrepreneurial activities. Moreover, this research further reveals the effects of industrial regulation in the context of China, suggesting that the government should be more effective in promoting administrative decentralization and reducing unnecessary interventions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Despite the numerous pieces of research that have been undertaken to aid understanding of the innovative activities of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), only a few have dealt with the interaction between innovation activity and the finance-related attitudes, literacy, and knowledge (competencies) of these companies. The current research focuses on specific aspects of the innovation activities of SMEs in a post-communist society (Hungary) by taking into consideration elements of both entrepreneurial financial culture and the social-economic environment. Our analysis is based on a national representative survey, 2017. Results show that the presence of a creative financial culture, and the grounding of management decisions correlate with company innovation. We found that subsidies as external financial sources contribute to a larger extent to the innovation activities of SMEs than other external and internal financial resources. Moreover, the study explores the effects of some economic and social competition-related factors. © 2019 Sage Publications.

AB  - Financial literacy is of utmost relevance in the field of entrepreneurship, especially in developing countries. However, what builds financial literacy and how it shapes investment decision-making of women entrepreneurs is an exiguously researched area. Building on this gap, this study postulates that women entrepreneurs’ prospect behavioural factors (loss aversion, regret aversion, mental accounting, and self-control) impact their investment decision process through the intervening role of financial literacy. Based on a stratified sample of 579 women entrepreneurs operating in Punjab, Pakistan, structural equation modelling was used to analyse the hypothesized relationship among variables. Findings showed that loss aversion, regret aversion, mental accounting, and self-control significantly influenced women’s financial literacy and investment decision process, whereas no impact of regret aversion was traced on investment decision-making. Thus, our results offered robust support that financial literacy stimulated by women entrepreneurs’ prospect behaviour invigorates their investment decision power. © 2021 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

AB  - In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, policymakers have been increasingly striving to support female entrepreneurship as a possible growth driver. This paper contributes to reconciling mixed findings in the literature on the effectiveness of entrepreneurial training with an analysis that links training and human capital, including tertiary education and non-cognitive skills, with gender gaps in entrepreneurial performance in Africa. We have found that while financial literacy training directly benefits men, it does not raise the sales levels of women entrepreneurs. Instead, tertiary education has a direct positive link with the performance of women. Consistent with our theoretical model where different skills are complements, tertiary education can act as a channel that makes training effective. Regarding non-cognitive skills, evidence shows that women entrepreneurs who are tenacious achieve stronger sales performance. Our results underscore the importance of including tertiary education and entrepreneurial training programs focused on a balanced set of skills, including non-cognitive skills, among policies for women entrepreneurs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In microfinance markets worldwide, over-indebtedness among borrowers and households has emerged as an important concern. Over-indebtedness, measured in terms of sacrifices made by households, is high in both rural and urban India. Factors statistically significant in explaining over-indebtedness are the borrower's age and financial literacy; the household's entrepreneurial activity, income level, and spatial location; and the proportion of dependent members in a household. © 2019 Economic and Political Weekly.

AB  - The motivation of the study is to gauge the effects of access to finance, technical know-how, and financial literacy on women’s empowerment through establishing women’s entrepreneurial development. A sample of 950 women-owned SMEs was considered, and structured questionnaires were sent from getting target responses. After careful assessment through the data cleansing procedure, it was found that only 795 responses are suitable for further investigation, implying the sample response rate for the study is 74.71%. The study implemented structural equation modeling and multivariate regression analysis for gauging the causal association that is direct and indirect effects of target variables. According to findings, a positive statistically significant linkage was revealed with women’s entrepreneurship sustainability and women empowerment. Furthermore, the mediating effects were also established for women’s empowerment. According to the study findings, it is suggested that for women entrepreneurship sustainability, effective policies surrounding financing accessibility, technical knowledge expansion, and financial understating have to be promulgated in the economy, which allows bringing women empowerment at large.

AB  - This study aims to map the potential sectors based on the financial and digital literacy of women entrepreneurs in the city of Palembang, Indonesia, which continues from the previous research by Fauzi, Antoni, and Suwarni (2020). The research sample is small and medium businesses owned and managed by women entrepreneurs in Palembang where there are 18 districts. The research sample is selected from 18 districts in the city of Palembang and the total sample used is 115 women entrepreneur respondents. Descriptive statistics is employed in this study to map potential sectors and the results show that most businesses in Palembang are businesses engaged in the food, beverage, and tobacco industry, which account for 44.9%, while businesses engaged in other processing sectors rank second among the micro and small businesses in Palembang. Local and provincial governments can be more responsive to stimulate the food, beverage, and tobacco industry sector, other processing industry sectors and the wood industry sector, and wood furniture products so that products in the industrial sector can be superior in the future. The provision of coaching and training must also be more intensively provided by the relevant agencies so that they can help micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to develop in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia have a significant impact on the economy, contributing 38.3% of GDP in 2022, and so serve as the backbone of the nation. Entrepreneurs’ intention to success and their demographic attributes play a crucial role in SMEs’ future growth (Delmar and Wiklund, 2008). This paper utilises the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to analyse and propose numerous determinants of attitude (ATT), subjective norms (SN), and perceived behavioural control (PBC) toward success intention among Muslim SMEs. Further, age, education, and gender to model Muslim SMEs’ intention to succeed are also analysed. This study contributes to the understanding of entrepreneurs’ intention to success and their demographic attributes that may lead to successful SMEs, in particular among Muslim SMEs in Malaysia.

AB  - Saving has been identified as an essential source for investments that eventually leads to the growth and development of the economy and contributes to the creation of new job opportunities. Accordingly, this study investigated the antecedents of saving behavior, i.e., financial literacy, parents' effect, peer influence and self-control and their impact on saving behavior of students at the community college of Abqaiq in Saudi Arabia. It also examined the impact of saving behavior on developing their entrepreneurial intention. The sample of the study was collected via a self-administrated questionnaire sent to 270 students at the community college of Abqaiq in Saudi Arabia. The data was then analyzed with the help of SMART-PLS-SEM. The findings reported that financial literacy, parents' effect, and peer influence significantly positively influence saving behavior. In contrast, self-control has a significant negative impact on saving behavior. On the other hand, saving behavior also substantially affects the students' entrepreneurial intention to start small entrepreneurial enterprises. The study adds to the existing literature on crucial factors affecting individuals' saving behavior, particularly Saudi Arabia students. In addition, it confirms the impact of accumulated savings on the entrepreneurial intention of the targeted group. © 2021 JESTP.

AB  - Based on primary data, the present study analyzes the gender income gap and its compositions throughout the income distribution of the handloom micro-entrepreneurs in Assam. The unconditional quantile decomposition reveals the existence of substantial gender income gaps along the income distribution. The differences in the productive characteristics explain much of the gap at the median and beyond. The endowment effects of education, financial literacy, risk attitude, SHGs membership, and technology adoption are found in favor of the male micro-entrepreneurs. The results suggest that the extent of risk aversion towards producing high-valued dress materials and poor management of entrepreneurial activities of the females have widened gender gap, particularly at the upper quantiles of the income distribution. © 2019, Eurasia Business and Economics Society.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to discuss the dilemma of digital banking and the financial inclusion agenda of countries with the level of strength of the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops an AML/CFT compliance index using the assessment data of FATF to measure the level compliance strength of countries to measure the impact of the strength of the AML/CFT regime on the financial inclusion. Financial literacy, literacy, number of bank branches and income level of countries are used as other control variables in regression analysis, which is used to test the developed model. Findings: The results suggest that the AML/CFT compliance level of a country is a significant factor in determining the level of financial inclusion. Besides, the number of bank branches for 100,000 people, literacy and financial literacy are significant factors in financial inclusion. However, the results reveal that financial literacy is significant over literacy in determining financial inclusion. Therefore, having considered the importance of the AML/CFT regime for financial inclusion, regulators are required to strengthen the AML/CFT regime and make clarity on the AML/CFT regulations. This clarity will promote the digitalization and financial inclusion over time. Practical implications: Most of the studies related to financial inclusion and AML/CFT aspects are qualitative. Therefore, this is only the start of measuring the strength of an AML/CFT regime. More appropriate measures will be developed in the future based on this foundation. Originality/value: This paper is an original work done by the author, which discusses the issues of digital banking and financial inclusion agenda of countries with the compliance strength of the AML/CFT regime. The AML/CFT compliance index is the original idea of the author, which can be used as a quantitative measure to capture the strength of the AML/CFT regimes in future studies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The main purpose of this study is examine entrepreneurial financial practices in Pakistan. The research has employed, resource-based view to analyse the impact of entrepreneur orientation on SMEs performance. Moreover, the role of access to finance has been analysed as a mediator in the relation between the performance of SMEs and entrepreneur orientation. Finally, the moderating role of financial literacy in the relationship between access to finance and firm performance of SMEs is examined. The study has employed a survey-based methodology to answer the research questions. The partial least square is used to analyse the data. A total of 441 questionnaires were received with complete responses, a response rate of 63 per cent. The study concludes that the impact of individual components of entrepreneur orientation on performance and access to debt is neglected in this approach. Financial literacy is one factor that can help the owner of an SME to decide the optimum financial level and also help them to devise strategies for fundraising. The study, which is among the pioneering studies on the issue, provides policy guidelines to entrepreneurs and researchers with regard to understanding the finance-related issues relevant to entrepreneurs in Pakistan. © 2019, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - In rural areas, entrepreneurship helps lift households out of poverty by alleviating unemployment and increasing income, and financial literacy plays an important role in promoting entrepreneurship. Social capital is a resource embedded in social relationships, the boundaries of which have been expanded by the development of information communications technologies (ICTs). This article aims to link social capital, financial literacy, and rural entrepreneurship through a partial mediating effect analysis. Using data from the 2015 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), we analyze how social capital affects rural entrepreneurship and the role of local ICTs development in this effect while also accounting for reverse causality. We construct a social capital indicator, mainly referring to bridging social capital, and two financial literacy indicators to make the conclusions robust. The empirical results show that social capital promotes rural entrepreneurship by sharing financial literacy. Furthermore, the spread of ICTs enhances this mediating effect. Our study provides empirical evidence for encouraging entrepreneurship and promoting knowledge sharing and implies the importance of ICTs in promoting entrepreneurship in rural areas. © Copyright © 2021 Zhao and Li.

AB  - Microfinance is the vanguard of financialization today. This is especially true in Colombia, where microfinance rivals any other type of formal credit. Entangled with Colombia’s micro-financialization is the phenomenon of microfinance corporations in joint ventures with Christian organizations that broker their microfinance programs. These faith-based corporations temper the surge in microfinance with ascetic discipline and the infusion of an entrepreneurial spirit. Economic discipline, say the microfinanciers, is required for what is referred to as ‘financial literacy’ and ‘financial inclusion’ programs that instil a distinctly Christian corporate order. This article, based on 2 years of sustained fieldwork in Colombia, focuses on one such microfinance program run by a transnational Christian credit organization. With microfinance, souls are disciplined through debts and ideals of an ascetic prosperity. In the end, the article concludes that there is a Christian morality to financialized capitalism that is exercised at the level of the interior soul. © The Author(s) 2020.

In Turkey, according to changes made in the Social Studies curriculum in 2018, Social Studies lessons are given to students in the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th grades, and comprise 27 basic skills, This study investigated the self-efficacy perceptions of 143 Social Studies teachers working in Istanbul province. The study found that the majority of teachers felt themselves to be “inefficient” in the following skills: research, perception of change and continuity, critical thinking, entrepreneurship, legal literacy, collaboration, using evidence, perceiving space, political literacy, drawing and interpreting table, graphics and diagrams, innovative thinking, and perceiving time and chronology. Additionally, it was found that the teachers believed that they were at a “good” or “very good” level of efficacy concerning the following skills: environmental literacy,digital literacy, empathy, financial literacy, observation, map literacy, communication, stereotypical judgment and prejudice, decision making, location analysis, media literacy, self-control, problem solving, social participation, and the correct, beautiful, and effective use of Turkish. This indicates that most Social Studies teachers who participated in the study perceived themselves as being at a positive/efficient level in 16 of the 27 skills. Therefore, the efficacies of Social Studies teachers regarding the basic skills of the 2018 Social Studies curriculum could provide opportunities for these individuals to apply effective strategies, methods, and techniques for their students. © 2021

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of financial and digital literacy on growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) managed by women in Indonesia. Data were collected through questionnaires of women entrepreneurs in Palembang, Indonesia. For the purpose of comparison, data of men entrepreneurs were also collected. The variables employed are latent variables such as financial literacy, digital literacy, SME’s growth which are derived from a series of questions to indicate each variable. A total of 240 women and 240 men were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results reveal that both financial and digital literacy had positive and significant effects on return on assets. On the other hand, only digital literacy had positive and significant effects on growth. The findings further evidence that women had a lower level of digital knowledge compared to men. Furthermore, the results show that in the short term, financial literacy and digital literacy are important to understand and implement. But in the long run, digital literacy plays an important role because it impacts business growth. This is in line with an increasingly fierce market competition where the market is also shifting from traditional markets to modern markets. Not only the market, but consumers are also shifting from traditional consumers to digital consumers. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: Access to financing has long been identified as a stumbling block for the economic endeavors of immigrant entrepreneurs (IEs) in host countries. Yet, little is known about the internal enablers for the IEs success to overcome their financing barriers in host countries. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to introduce the theoretical concept of the financial ambidexterity of IEs as a potential behavioral ability some IEs develop over time to access financing in both host and coethnic contexts. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses sociopsychological lenses to introduce and discuss the term “financial ambidexterity of IEs” by synthesizing empirical evidence drawn from the different literature on immigrant entrepreneurship, biculturalism, financial literacy and cultural intelligence. This discussion is carefully embedded within the framework of the immigrant entrepreneurship literature. Findings: The study proposes and discusses the role of bicultural identity integration, cultural intelligence and financial literacy in enabling the “financial ambidexterity of IEs.” It further defines the “financial ambidexterity of IEs” as their ability to explore and exploit financing opportunities, either simultaneously across the contexts within which they are embedded, e.g. coethnic and mainstream, or alternately in one context when barriers occur in the other. Originality/value: The paper mainly contributes to the literature on immigrant entrepreneurship by suggesting an explanation for how IEs overcome financing barriers in their host countries, and why some IEs are more successful in that than other peers. Moreover, the paper attempts to advance the understanding of immigrants' entrepreneurial endeavors using a sociopsychological lens that considers cultural, cognitive and knowledge-related factors. © 2022, Bryan Malki.

AB  - Recent events in Europe and the United States suggest that open economies are increasingly under stress as nationalist, protectionist and populist political entrepreneurs are gaining significant ground across the Western world. Many theories have been formulated as to which factors are more likely to explain such policy preferences. The hypothesis tested in this paper is that financial literacy affects economic policy preferences. I analyse data from the British Election Study and test my theory on support for free trade in the United Kingdom. Findings suggest that financial literacy does affect economic policy preferences. On average, financially literate individuals are more likely to think that free trade is good for the British economy. Furthermore, this is true regardless of economic self-interest, as both financially literate winners and losers from globalisation are more likely to support free trade than their illiterate counterparts. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd
