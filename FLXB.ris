TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY AND NEW BUSINESS ENTRY
T2  - FINANCIAL INTERNET QUARTERLY
AB  - The issue of the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurship is still not a fully explored research area. On the one hand, there are common views that financial literacy and education in finance are necessary in every individual's life, and that an insufficient level of financial literacy may result in erroneous economic decisions. On the other hand, research on the impact of narrowly defined financial literacy on business start-up decisions is still rare. As a result, there are no clear indications regarding the need for education in the area of finance in order to stimulate entrepreneurial decisions, including the survival of launched economic undertakings. This article deals with the relationship between financial literacy and chosen entrepreneurial aspects such as 1) Phases of Entrepreneurial Activity; 2) Entrepreneurial potential; 3) Motivation; 4) Involvement in the technology sector; and 5) Business exit reasons. All of the above aspects are embedded in the context of financial literacy. The article sheds light on the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurship and creates a background for further attempts to deepen understanding of this issue.

TI  - Financial Literacy Overconfidence and Stock Market Participation
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - Stock market participation is considered as an indicator of consumer financial well-being. This study examined the association between financial literacy overconfidence and stock market participation. Financial literacy overconfidence was measured by the difference between an individual's subjective and objective financial literacy scores. Data from the 2012 Chinese Survey of Consumer Finance was analyzed. The results showed that financial literacy overconfidence is positively correlated with stock market participation. On the other hand, under-confidence is negatively correlated to stock market participation. This study contributes to the existing literature by relating a unique factor, financial literacy overconfidence, to stock market participation.

TI  - Financial literacy and entrepreneurial risk aversion
T2  - JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - We explore the interaction effects of financial literacy and risk aversion on becoming an entrepreneur. We use two independent datasets to provide evidence that the difference in risk aversion between entrepreneurs and wage earners is conditional on their financial literacy. First, we use the De Nederlandsche Bank's Household Survey and find lower risk aversion only for entrepreneurs with lower financial literacy. The difference disappears for entrepreneurs with higher financial literacy. Second, we show that the results are robust in a fully incentivized field experiment with high-tech startups from three European countries. The results reveal a potential channel of how financial literacy can promote entrepreneurship.

TI  - The impact of undergraduate personal finance education on individual financial literacy, attitudes and intentions
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - Financial literacy education features prominently among the policy options available to improve personal financial decision-making. Notwithstanding calls to expand delivery of financial literacy units at university level, such offerings are relatively rare with little evaluation. We provide an evaluation of the impact on financial literacy, financial attitudes and financial behaviour intentions of a semester unit in personal finance delivered to undergraduates at an Australian university, carefully controlling for confounding effects in the analysis. We report increases in objective and subjective financial literacy and an additional gender effect. Contrary to previous speculation, we do not find overconfidence as an associated outcome.

TI  - Situating financial literacy
T2  - CRITICAL PERSPECTIVES ON ACCOUNTING
AB  - This paper comments on the conceptualisation of financial literacy by investigating how it is defined, problematised, and operationalised as a part of the efforts to overcome its perceived impediments. The backdrop of this study is the idea that the financial literacy movement goes hand in hand with the financialisation of society. By reporting from a study of financial literacy practices, the aim is to disentangle the notion of financial literacy from the assumption that it is a singular capability that, when gained, will automatically affect people's financial practices. The paper draws on a recent development in literacy research, New Literacy Studies, and on its division into autonomous and ideological definitions of literacy. The empirical illustrations originate from the efforts made to decrease financial illiteracy among Swedish adolescents and the demand for financial literacy in audit committees. Contrary to earlier studies, this paper demonstrates that financial literacy does not merely refer to a character trait that researchers may find lacking among the marginalised actors in society. Financial literacy cannot merely be viewed as the ability to read and write in the language of finance and accounting. Instead, financial literacy is a concept that needs to be situated and studied in practice because the characteristics that constitute financial literacy, or those that apply to it, vary with time and place.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Self-Employment
T2  - ECONOMIC PAPERS
AB  - This article uses individual-level data collected in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey in 2016 to econometrically explore the direction of causation between financial literacy and self-employment. The empirical approach is based on applying instrumental variables (IV) analysis in a three-outcome labour supply model (i.e. self-employment, employee employment and non-employment) that controls for selection into employment. In keeping with a small number of studies, the analysis suggests that there is a positive relationship between financial literacy and self-employment. The analysis also suggests that the likely causal direction is from financial literacy to self-employment. However, this is also found for employee employment. Therefore, policies aimed at increasing financial literacy will likely not only increase self-employment but also employee employment. This suggests that financial literacy may be a form of "general human capital," such as education, work experience or training. However, the impact of financial literacy on self-employment is not larger (more positive) for self-employment compared to employee employment. Clearly much more research is needed to understand the numerous relationships between financial literacy and other labour market outcomes.

TI  - Financial literacy and mortgage stress
T2  - JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE
AB  - This paper examines the effect of financial literacy on mortgage stress. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we find that borrowers with high levels of financial literacy are over 60 percent less likely to suffer from mortgage stress than borrowers with low levels of financial literacy after controlling for observables. Our findings remain robust to various potential issues, including sample selection bias and functional misspecifications. Moreover, we find that the effect of financial literacy varies across different age groups of borrowers. Further analysis reveals strong cross effects of financial literacy and quantitative reasoning on mortgage stress.

TI  - Financial literacy among Malaysian Muslim undergraduates
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose
   University students are known to face many challenges in achieving high financial literacy. The purpose of this paper is to examine the level of financial literacy among Malaysian Muslim undergraduates as explained through sociocultural variables. Furthermore, this paper explores a few additional Islamic measurements as part of assessing the level of financial literacy among the students.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The questionnaires were drafted based on a multi-dimensional financial literacy model and distributed conveniently to 330 respondents. Post-interviews were also conducted with selected students to further comprehend the sociocultural context.
   Findings
   The findings suggest that exposing students to financial education and practices influence their financial literacy scores. Students who attended muamalat-related courses demonstrated better financial literacy scores. Meanwhile, post-interview results indicate that the students' social environment and interactions also play important roles in enhancing their financial literacy. Hence, it is believed that it is essential to embed Islamic-based measurements to equip students with financial literacy in tandem with their pedagogic development. The results thus extend previous studies by confirming the importance of Islamic-based finance- and business-related knowledge for all tertiary students. Furthermore, the curricula should be made compatible to their studying environment and attuned to their values and cultures.
   Social implications
   The study indicates the importance of high financial literacy among tertiary students for them to have a financially stable future.
   Originality/value
   The research is original in its use of several measurements of financial literacy that embedded Islamic teachings concomitant to the Muslim respondents.

TI  - GENDER DIFFERENCES IN RATIONALITY AND FINANCIAL LITERACY
T2  - TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS
AB  - Financial literacy is an important indicator of the overall knowledge of individuals needed for everyday decision-making in individual finances. Acceleration of economic processes has increased importance of financial literacy over time. The aim of the presented study is to examine the financial literacy of adolescents and young adults in Slovakia in context of their rationality. Using questionnaire, we collect data on 447 individuals. Correspondence analysis reveals that men's financial literacy is more dependent on rationality for less rational men and strongly rational men. In the case of moderately rational men, we find relatively inconsistent results in relation to financial literacy. Women ' s financial literacy is less determined by their rationality.

TI  - Energy efficiency and financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Financial literacy explains anomalies in a wide range of consumers' financial decisions. We extend the literature on financial literacy by examining its role in the purchase of energy consumer durables: a setting purported to suffer from sub-optimal levels of investment due to consumer mistakes. We augment a standard choice experiment for purchasing a hot water system with data on financial literacy. Financial literacy is an economically important and statistically significant determinant of investment in energy efficiency. This result is robust to incorporating individual discount rates and risk aversion, as well as standard controls such as income and education, indicating that financial literacy is not merely a proxy for standard demographic characteristics. Financial literacy also makes choices more consistent with standard consumer preferences and increases the probability that respondents select investments with the lowest lifetime discounted costs. The results establish low financial literacy as a mechanism driving low investment in energy efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Is Financial Literacy Dangerous? Financial Literacy, Behavioral Factors, and Financial Choices of Households
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES
AB  - Using original purpose-built 2018 Japanese survey data, we estimate the financial behaviors and attitudes of households. We find that financial literacy plays an important and consistent role in financial decision-making. However, the actual behaviors are counter-intuitive: people with high levels of financial literacy tend to take too many risks, overborrow, and hold naive financial attitudes. That is, financial literacy tends to cause people to become daring and reckless toward some financial aspects. By contrast, financially literate people are better at retirement planning and are indifferent to gambling. Preferences such as risk and loss aversions and discount factors, also play a role in financial choices.

TI  - Provincial Marketization and Individual Financial Literacy in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE PSYCHOLOGY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - In the past decades, China has experienced a process of marketization, but the levels of marketization in each province are imbalanced. The present research examines how provincial-level marketization predicts individual-level financial literacy in China by investigating a nationally representative sample with a set of standardized financial literacy tests. The results showed a positive association with a diminishing return between marketization and the Homo economicus index of financial literacy, including financial knowledge, financial capacity, and financial management values. Furthermore, there was a U-shaped relationship between marketization and the Homo sociologicus index of financial literacy, including wealth values and financial ethics. The findings not only contribute to understanding the nonmonotonic roles of marketization on different facets of financial literacy but also point to an institutional avenue for policymakers and practitioners interested in improving individual financial literacy.

TI  - Having Trouble Making Ends Meet? Financial Literacy Makes the Difference
T2  - ITALIAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB  - Financial stability is an important contributor to economic and psychological well-being. However, even before the economic upheaval of the Covid-19 pandemic, many households around the world had trouble making ends meet. The aim of this paper is twofold. First of all, we investigate financial literacy's effect on householders' ability to easily make ends meet. Then we focus on any financial literacy differential effects on female householders. We use subsamples from the Bank of Italy Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) and find that the data support the positive impact of higher financial literacy. Householders who correctly answer the Big Three questions-the standard assessment of financial literacy-are 8 percentage points more likely to make ends meet easily. When we apply a more comprehensive financial literacy indicator (21-score) based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) methodology, the effect is even stronger (13.5 percentage points). Household financial stability is lower in southern regions of Italy and among women householders, but no findings support differential effects on women. Our estimates are robust to different models such as OLS, Probit and Ordered Probit and financial literacy specifications. Overall, our results underscore the economic importance of financial literacy in ensuring social and economic well-being.

TI  - Does financial literacy drive entrepreneurship in rural China?
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Developing financial literacy is a crucial part of entrepreneurship. It can aid aspiring entrepreneurs to learn how to analyze market trends, formulate business plans, conduct cost accounting activities, and navigate fiscal risks in their businesses. Therefore, we investigated the most recent dataset on rural residents in China to determine the effects of financial literacy on their entrepreneurial behaviors. Our observations reveal that individuals with high financial literacy, that is, those who have attained advanced financial knowledge, are more likely to start a business than those with low financial literacy. We employed instrumental variable analysis to mitigate the endogeneity of financial literacy. Results show a causal relationship between Chinese rural residents' financial literacy and entrepreneurship. Finally, we demonstrate that the aggressive risk attitudes of rural families magnify the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurship.

T2  - ACCOUNTING EDUCATION
AB  - Financial literacy education, or the lack thereof, has received much attention in recent years. Over the past two decades, we have witnessed the dot com bubble, corporate scandals that stirred the market, and a large recession. Because many individuals turn to accountants for financial advice, it is now more important than ever for professionals to possess a strong foundation in basic financial literacy to better serve their clients. While the responsibility of financial literacy education does not lie with one institution or one individual, multiple efforts have been put in place to provide financial literacy education to the public. The purpose of this paper is to describe how financial literacy education was successfully incorporated into the accounting classroom to provide tomorrow's professionals with a strong foundation in financial literacy.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY AND RATIONALITY OF YOUTH IN SLOVAKIA
T2  - TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS
AB  - In recent years, the importance of issue of financial literacy of young people increases. Given view is evidenced by numerous research studies which aim to detect the factors that determine the financial literacy level of subjects of studies. The aim of presented study is to reveal relationship between financial literacy and rationality of students in Slovakia. We use questionnaire to detect rationality and financial literacy level of subjects. In regression we also control for control for age, gender, type of school and number of family members to detect possible variables that can influence financial literacy. Our findings suggest that males' financial literacy is higher than females' one. We also document that adolescents are less financially literate than 22+ years old students. Interesting is finding about relationship between financial literacy and number of family members. Students from families with more members are more financially literate than students from less membered families. The positive relationship between rationality and financial literacy is proven, despite being weaker than we expected.

TI  - Stereotypes in financial literacy: Evidence from PISA
T2  - JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE
AB  - We examine gender differences in financial literacy among high school students in Italy using data from the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Gender differences in financial literacy are large among the young in Italy. They are present in all regions and are particularly severe in the South and the Islands. Combining the rich PISA data with a variety of other indicators, we provide a thorough analysis of the potential determinants of the gender gap in financial literacy. We find that parental background, in particular the role of mothers, matters for the financial knowledge of girls. Moreover, we show that the social and cultural environment in which girls and boys live plays a crucial role in explaining gender differences. We also show that history matters: Medieval commercial hubs and the nuclear family structure created conditions favorable to the transformation of the role of women in society, and shaped gender differences in financial literacy as well. We discuss the changes that are needed to close the gap in financial knowledge among the young.

We show that the marginal value of financial literacy increases with market volatility, but is hampered by the cost of financial education. A solution is derived for the case of reversible investment. Reversibility increases the fundamental value of financial literacy because of education -related rents.

TI  - Financial literacy and student debt
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - Using a large sample of over 1000 students from a major, land-grant, public university in Massachusetts, we examine the financial literacy level of college students, and its implications on the repayment of student debt. We find low levels of financial literacy (39.5%), particularly among female (26%), minority (24%) and first-generation (33%) students. Based on survey responses, we show that students with a deficit in financial literacy are more likely to underestimate future student loan payments; 38.2% of low-literacy students underestimate future payments by more than $1000 annually, while high financial literacy reduces the probability of significant payment underestimation by 17-18 percentage points. Furthermore, we find evidence of a financial literacy wage gap as students with low financial literacy expect significantly lower starting salaries than their high-literacy peers. As a result, low-literacy students are more vulnerable to unexpected, adverse shocks on their payment-to-income ratios that can impair their future creditworthiness and undermine their ability to service debt post-graduation.

TI  - Financial literacy and security-based crowdfunding
T2  - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW
AB  - Research Question/Issue: This study investigates the relationship between financial literacy and the survival profile of the security-based crowdfunding platforms. Security-based crowdfunding has recently emerged as a novel market that allows small investors to engage directly in financing entrepreneurial ventures. However, a certain level of financial literacy is required to understand and manage these digital finance tools. A better understanding of the impact of financial literacy is, therefore, central to the development of these markets and the achievement of their inclusive potential.
   Research Findings/Insights: Using data of the universe of 432 security-based crowdfunding platforms in 37 OECD countries from 2007 to 2019, we find higher platforms' survival profiles where the level of financial literacy is high. Financial literacy, however, needs to combine with specific platform characteristics to take full effect, as it matters more to those platforms that deliver voting rights and that provide poorer value-added services to crowdfunding investors.
   Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study provides empirical support to the role of governance mechanisms at the platform level for differences in the level of financial literacy across countries. As such, it contributes to literature both on financial literacy and corporate governance. Additionally, it extends previous research in crowdfunding to the platform level.
   Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study calls for the attention of policymakers interested in the development of crowdfunding markets. The importance of financial literacy varies with the presence of governance mechanisms and information production at the platform-level.

T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - PurposeThis study examines the gender gap in financial literacy in Ghana.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs primary data and probit models together with the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition strategy.FindingsThe authors found that males are generally more financially literate than females are. The results also show that much of the gender gap in financial literacy is explained by differences in coefficients or how literacy is produced and not by differences in the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of men and women. Thus, the gap may be attributable to unobserved behavioural and psychological traits, as well as cultural and social norms regarding gender roles in financial decision-making.Practical implicationsIt is evident that further action is needed to bridge the gap between men and women with regards to financial literacy. Effective interventions may include improving women's access to financial information and education, as well as encouraging their participation in household financial decision-making and planning. In particular, less educated women need to be targeted by policy initiatives in this regard.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the scant literature on gender gap in financial literacy in developing countries.

TI  - Precautionary savings, retirement planning and misperceptions of financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We measure financial literacy among Linkedln members, complementing standard questions with additional questions that allow us to gauge self-perceptions of financial literacy. Average financial literacy is surprisingly low given the demographics of our sample: fewer than two-thirds of chief financial officers, chief executive officers, and chief operating officers complete the test correctly. Financial literacy, precautionary savings and retirement planning are positively correlated, but this is mostly driven by perceived, not actual, literacy: controlling for self-perceptions, actual literacy has low predictive power. Perceptions drive decision-making among low-literacy respondents and are associated with mistaken beliefs about financial products and less willingness to accept financial advice.

TI  - Financial literacy and retirement planning in Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - In this paper, we draw on internationally comparable survey evidence on financial literacy and retirement planning in Canada to investigate how financially literate Canadians are and how financial literacy is linked to retirement planning. We find that 42% of respondents are able to correctly answer three simple questions measuring knowledge of interest compounding, inflation, and risk diversification. This is consistent with evidence from other countries, and Canadians perform relatively well in comparison with Americans but worse than individuals in other countries, such as Germany. Among Canadian respondents, the young and the old, women, minorities, and those with lower educational attainment do worse, a pattern that has been consistently found in other countries as well. Retirement planning is strongly associated with financial literacy; those who responded correctly to all three financial literacy questions are 10 percentage points more likely to have retirement savings.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY IN ROMANIA: A TEST OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS STUDENTS
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Romania is in a rather dishonorable position from the financial literacy perspective in the European Union, ranking last among countries. To increase the level of financial education of the Romanian population, public and private institutions, organizations, and companies have recently taken the initiative in this field, mostly after 2015. Our contribution builds on these recent developments and aims at testing the level of basic financial literacy of Romanian university students, enrolled in business and economics studies, using the OECD Financial literacy test. Data was collected through an online survey on a voluntary basis, and the responses were analyzed using statistical indicators. Results indicate a rather high level of financial literacy among students, but also significant differences among respondents that may be explained by several demographic characteristics and specific attributes. The most important characteristics that influence the degree of financial literacy of students are age, students' cycle of studies, the way the students live, property ownership and students' involvement in financial market transactions and contracts. We stress towards the need to act through concrete measures to improve young people financial literacy, as a necessary condition to navigate in an increasingly complex environment, where finance plays an essential role.

TI  - An Analysis of Indonesian Farmer's Financial Literacy
T2  - ESTUDIOS DE ECONOMIA APLICADA
AB  - The uncertainty of income earned by farmers, namely crop failure with a very high risk, will cause financial problems in their families. The target or respondents of this study are farmers who live in Lahat Regency, South Sumatera. Initial findings indicate that the level of financial inclusion of farmers in the Lahat Regency is still quite low. The purpose of this study is to analyze the level of farmers' financial literacy, identify the components of farmers' financial literacy, and analyze the factors that affect the level of farmers' financial literacy. The research method applied is descriptive analysis and multiple regression. The analysis showed that most of the literate farmers were in the moderately literate category of 47.2 percent and the least of the farmers in the less literate category was 24.5 percent. The financial attitude component gave the largest contribution to the farmers' financial literacy index, which was 0.73. Besides, the factor affecting the level of financial literacy of farmers is education. The policy implication resulting from this research is the existence of a structured promotion and training of financial literacy for farmers by local governments. In addition, campaigning for the importance of being educated and inviting educated people to start running agricultural business activities.

T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - This study examines the relationship between financial literacy and the consumption of elderly households. Using panel data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), empirical analysis reveals that improved financial literacy can promote increased consumption among elderly households. Furthermore, the impact of enhanced financial literacy on enjoyable consumption is more significant than subsistence consumption's.

TI  - Financial literacy and retirement planning in Ghana
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to investigate the impact of financial literacy on savings and retirement planning in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach The study uses primary data collected from a sample of formal sector workers and probit models, to assess how financial literacy affects retirement planning. Findings The empirical analysis of this study shows that most individuals lack knowledge of basic concepts of finance. This study finds that only about 27% of respondents were able to correctly answer three simple questions on inflation, interest compounding and risk diversification. Generally, the young, the old, women, low-income earners and the less educated perform worst on financial literacy measures. Also, financial literacy has a positive significant impact on the probability of saving for retirement. Practical implications The low level of financial literacy observed should be of concern to policymakers. Evidently, concrete measures are required to strengthen the knowledge of particularly those in the vulnerable groups such as the young, the old, women, low-income earners and the less educated, in order to enable them to prepare adequately for retirement. Originality/value The study contributes to the scant financial literacy and financial behavior literature in developing countries such as Ghana.

TI  - Financial literacy amongst elderly Australians
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - Financial illiteracy is widespread amongst the elderly. Financially illiterate people are more likely to experience asset loss and outlive their savings after retirement. This paper measures financial literacy of elderly Australians using Item Responses Theory. Using a Lasso regression, we find that younger, married males with higher income and greater net wealth are more likely to be financially literate. Better financial literacy is also associated with good health, higher educational attainment, better occupation and outright home ownership. Our findings suggest policy-makers take action and we make informed and practicable policy recommendations.

TI  - Youth in individualistic countries have higher financial literacy: Evidence from PISA
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Financial literacy is an important life skill, but to date, it is mostly studied on the individual level. To investigate the role of national culture in financial literacy, we analyze data from 20 countries participating in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 financial literacy assessment with four approaches to measuring national culture: Hofstede, Schwartz, Inglehart-Welzel, and Minkov-Kaasa cultural dimension frameworks. This is the first study that links PISA financial literacy scores to these four culture models simultaneously, filling a gap in research on youth financial literacy. We find that culture explains an important part of within-country variance in financial literacy. The results indicate that individualism is positively associated with youth financial literacy scores, with the Schwartz embeddedness dimension remaining consistent after a set of control variables. Therefore, financial education initiatives need to consider in their design and implication the cultural context of the participants.

TI  - A Study on Financial Literacy among University Students
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The rapid development in the financial markets has led to the arrival of innovative financial products and services in the market. The consumer is often in a dilemma about which financial product to choose from. Financial ignorance leads to wrong financial decisions which hamper the path to achieving holistic well-being. Financial literacy is the key requirement to make an optimal financial decision. It helps to better understand the financial initiatives of the government. Possessing financial literacy is a must skill for individuals from various domains. The core of that domain is students. They are the cornerstone of the future. While pursuing their higher education, students face numerous obstacles. They frequently struggle with time management, health, stress while trying to achieve good academic grades, and money management, along with other things. Their primary source of revenue at this crucial stage is their part-time employment or pocket money. Equipping them with smart money management skills helps them to balance their finances and academics. Financial literacy helps to achieve financial well-being which helps to reduce financial stress. An attempt is made to study financial literacy and the various socio-demographic factors affecting financial literacy among students pursuing graduation and post-graduation in Commerce from Punjabi University, Patiala. This has been highlighted in various studies that the students from the financial domain have an edge in financial concepts over students from other disciplines. The (Rooij, Lusardi, &Alessie, 2007) questionnaire based on Basic and Sophisticated Financial Literacy was used to assess financial literacy. The research relied on first-hand data gathered from 300 university students. The data was evaluated using percentage analysis, the T-test, and one-way ANOVA. The study highlighted that the mean percentage of financial literacy among students is 65.83 which is an indicator of good financial literacy.56% of university students have a good level of financial knowledge. The investigation of financial literacy across demographics revealed that female students have lower financial literacy than male students. The studies conducted by various organisations like the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and National Centre for Financial Education in India also expressed their concern about lower financial literacy among women in their studies. The T-Test findings revealed that gender and education level make a substantial difference in financial literacy levels, however residential area has no impact on financial literacy levels. The One Way ANOVA findings showed that parental qualification had no effect on students' financial literacy. This study will add more aspects to previous studies on financial literacy. Despite, studying the same curriculum why female students are still lagging in financial literacy? It will help the policymakers to frame the policies that are conducive to enhancing the financial literacy among female students. Educational institutions must focus on the practicality of the curriculum with enhanced exposure to financial terms. Early the inculcation of financial skills, the better will the financial foundation of individuals.

TI  - Individual entrepreneurial behavior and financial literacy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - The technological revolution we have been witnessing over the last 30 years is bringing about important changes in business management, specifically in the conception, development, and management of its financial aspects. How to face these challenges is a particularly critical question for individual entrepreneurs who have to assume a much greater responsibility for decisions than in other corporate environments. In this sense, it is very important to understand the financial capabilities and skills and their limitations of this type of entrepreneurship, which is so important for the renewal and extension of the business community in any developed economy. Based on an extensive official survey of this type of entrepreneurship, this research proposes a logistic regression modeling, in order to find out the level of financial knowledge of this business group. One of the findings of this research is that individual entrepreneurs have a higher level of financial knowledge than salaried workers, with a higher qualification in this respect in the case of individual entrepreneurs with employees. This study analyses the link between individual entrepreneurs or self-employed workers - with or without employees - and financial literacy. In addition, we investigated the relationship between this group with their socio-demographic characteristics, financial product holdings, financial planning, and financial fragility. Different binary logistic regression models with maximum likelihood were estimated using a sample of individual entrepreneurs and self-employed workers from the Survey of Financial Competences database conducted in Spain to achieve this. The results of the study show that individuals who choose to be individual entrepreneurs or self-employed, and in particular those with hired workers, had a higher level of financial literacy than salaried workers. Moreover, it was confirmed that financial literacy complements the explanatory power of the other variables analyzed with respect to sole proprietors without employees, although not to a significant degree. The limitations of this work are due to the use of data from the Financial Skills Survey, so some dichotomous variables offer very generic information. In addition, the database is cross-sectional and we cannot analyze variations between different periods. No research before had applied the relationships between the behavior of individual entrepreneurs, with and without employees, and financial competencies using logistic functions and on the basis of a rigorous and comprehensive formal questionnaire. The conclusions provide a valuable perspective for developing training programs for this type of human capital aimed at raising the financial skills of individual entrepreneurs to improve personal and business management.

TI  - Financial literacy, trust and retirement planning
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - We study the complex relationship between financial literacy, retirement planning and trust in financial institutions, using data from the 2010 Bank of Italy Survey on Household Income and Wealth. The impact of financial literacy on retirement planning is a well-established issue in the existing empirical literature; our main contribution is proving that financial knowledge not only impacts retirement planning, but also the decisions of entering a private pension scheme (or devoting the severance pay to a private pension scheme). Adding the consideration of trust poses serious econometric concerns, since both financial literacy and trust in financial institutions are likely to be endogenous and the presence of two endogenous regressors renders the identification of causality very difficult. Our solution is to keep only financial literacy as endogenous and include in our models an exogenous regional indicator of social capital (similar to the one adopted by Guiso et al., 2004), as a proxy for the level of trust between the counterparts of a financial contract in each geographical area. Our main findings show that trust has a positive influence on both the decisions to enter a private pension scheme or to devote the severance pay to a private pension scheme.

TI  - The Effects of Financial Literacy on Sustainable Entrepreneurship
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Entrepreneurship contributes to the economic well-being of every country. Specifically, the level of individual entrepreneurship is crucial in the process of developing and building economic potential, especially in Central European countries. Among the several factors impacting entrepreneurship, the ability to access the necessary external sources of financing need to be considered crucial. The financial literacy of the entrepreneur plays a crucial role in the relationship between the lender and the borrower. In this paper, we investigate the effects of financial literacy on sustainable entrepreneurship. We based our analysis on the framework proposed by the World Economic Forum. We present an OLS model that adopts entrepreneurship, financial literacy and macroeconomic variables. The analysis is carried out on individual and national data from different sources of information (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, World Bank, and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development). The results show a positive and statistically significant relationship between financial literacy and sustainable entrepreneurial activity. This evidence supports the increasing number of financial education initiatives and the inclusion of topics related to economic and financial culture in school education systems. We identify internationally valid policy implications. In the context of the growth strategies of Central European countries, financial literacy takes on even greater importance. The introduction of financial education in the national curricula could strengthen entrepreneurial skills and accelerate the inclusive growth process across Europe.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY AND HOUSEHOLD INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE: EVIDENCE FROM CHINA
T2  - TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS
AB  - Financial innovations centred on science and technology bring diversified financial products, which are beneficial to meet the diversified demands of household asset allocation. However, household investment performance is not improved, which may be due to the lack of household financial literacy. To explore the effects and action mechanisms of financial literacy on household investment performance, a theoretical model of household investment decision-making was constructed. Theoretical hypotheses were verified by experiments using the data of the China Household Finance Survey in 2013. Results demonstrate that household financial literacy has positive impacts on household investment performance and improving financial literacy is conducive to enhance such performance. A good household financial literacy can increase the possibility of households to participate in stock, fund, and bond markets. However, improving financial literacy cannot increase household participation in the real estate market considering that such market possesses dual attributes of investments and residences. The conclusions provide theoretical references for government sectors to set up a long-term mechanism for household financial literacy education and for the supervision of financial institutions to increase social responsibility.

Among the mechanisms through which financial literacy facilitates the transition of disadvantaged rural-urban migrants into entrepreneurs, social capital emerges as the most important, consistent with the findings of the literature on underdog entrepreneurship.

TI  - SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC DETERMINANTS OF FINANCIAL LITERACY LEVELS
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - This article analyses the sociodemographic determinants associated with the financial literacy levels of the Chilean population based on three dimensions: (1) knowledge; (2) behaviour; and (3) attitude. The study draws from data of the first and, thus far, the only national survey that has measured financial competency, conducted in 2016 by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), funded by the Financial Market Commission (CMF in Spanish) and the Andean Development Corporation (CAF in Spanish). It analyses the impact sociodemographic factors such as sex, age, education, and employment situation have on the financial literacy level of the population surveyed (N = 1.224). For each dimension, logistic regression models were adjusted consistent with the global financial literacy index. This method aimed to calculate, based on these variables, the probability that an individual may possess adequate knowledge, behaviour, and financial attitude. The findings indicate that a person between 30 and 60 years old, with a high education level, who earns a high income, will have a greater probability of possessing an adequate financial literacy level.

TI  - Financial literacy programmes targeting the poor: the possibilities of using financial literacy as a tool for financial inclusion
T2  - ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI
AB  - The main aim of this study is to examine the nature of the term financial literacy and link it to opportunities for financial inclusion. The author uses experience of some Hungarian programmes. Financial literacy is the focus of some of them, while in other cases it is just a part of a more complex initiative. After the literature review, the study offers answers for the following research questions:
   center dot What are the main characteristics of existing financial literacy programmes in Hungary?
   center dot How financial exclusion and the lack of financial literacy are connected in practice?
   center dot What are the strengths (achievements) and weaknesses (pitfalls and disadvantages) of existing financial literacy programmes related to the financial inclusion of poor and marginalized social groups?
   Data from semi-structured in-depth expert interviews, documents and former research papers were collected for identifying Hungarian financial literacy programmes and their existing, missing and potential connections to financial inclusion.
   Originality of the Research
   In the literature, there are few articles that connect financial literacy and financial inclusion. Similarly, in practice, financial literacy programmes rarely target the poor. In turn, financial awareness is a very strong prerequisite of financial inclusion, e.g. successful debt settlement for financially vulnerable groups. The findings from the study will enlighten policy-makers, managers of financial institutions and financial inclusion advocates

TI  - Financial Literacy to Improve Sustainability: A Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The study of financial literacy and sustainability has attracted much interest recently and is expanding quickly. This paper offers a trustworthly, consistent, and current financial literacy and sustainability analysis following bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review. Concerning 127 documents published between 2008 and October 2022, we specifically examined the co-occurrence of author keywords, co-citation analysis of cited references, and subsequent in-depth analysis. Results show that the following topics have received the most attention in analyzing financial literacy and sustainability research: (1) financial inclusion; (2) financial behaviour; (3) financial systems; and (4) decision-making. The trick-down growth and development theory, the consumption function theory, the resource-based view theory, and the theory of entrepreneurship are the theoretical pillars supporting this study's structure. Next, we create an integrative framework as the foundation for additional research. As a result, this review provides a thorough overview of financial literacy and sustainability research.

A survey of 375 small creative business entrepreneurs was conducted in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and a hierarchical linear regression was used for data analysis. Findings The results reveal a positive correlation between artistic orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, financial literacy and entrepreneurial performance. Therefore, artistic orientation affects a creative firm's financial and nonfinancial performance. In addition, artistic orientation and financial literacy provide a positive influence on the overall performance of a creative venture. However, the interaction effect of entrepreneurial orientation and financial literacy on the artistic orientation - performance relationship - is invisible Originality/value This research is the first systematic empirical test evaluating the relationship between artistic orientation and entrepreneurial performance

TI  - Retirement concerns and financial literacy in Brunei
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY
AB  - Purpose Despite the inclusion of financial literacy in retirement studies, there are limited studies that look into retirement concerns and how financial literacy plays a role in managing retirement concerns. Understanding retirement concerns prior to retirement is important given how it affects retirement satisfaction. Therefore, this paper aims at assessing the retirement concerns in Brunei and the role of financial literacy in managing those concerns. Design/methodology/approach 700 government employees, divided into three groups, were interviewed: Defined Contribution Plan (DCP) employees retiring in the next 10-15 years, DCP employees retiring in 20-30 years' time and Defined Benefit Plan (DBP) employees retiring in the next 10 years. Pearson's chi-square tests and logistic regressions were used to ascertain significant relationships. Findings The results indicate the relatively younger DCP group is more likely to be financially literate compared to senior groups however, these respondents are more inclined to focus on private home ownership at this juncture. The findings also indicate the importance of knowing how much to save for retirement towards determining those with an additional retirement plan, and consequently reducing their retirement concerns. The value of financial advice is also significant in determining the amount to save for retirement and in possessing an additional retirement plan. Research limitations/implications - Results cannot be generalised to the population, as purposive sampling was utilised due to the absence of a population frame. Practical implications - The implications of the paper may provide value to policymakers to consider approaches to enhance the quality of financial advice and provide sound knowledge in computing the amount needed for retirement. Understanding the role of financial literacy vis-a-vis retirement concerns may also be useful for neighbouring countries with similar socio-cultural aspects such as Malaysia. Originality/value Given the limited research on retirement concerns and financial literacy, this paper is one of the few to emphasise on the importance of knowing how much is needed to save for retirement, in relation to retirement concerns. This may also be useful in other countries/communities with similar retirement context such as those with relatively low retirement planning or with similar retirement schemes. Further, with the 1993 pension reform, there is no known publication on retirement concerns and expectations in Brunei. Left unchecked, it may lead to poverty in old age and/or dependency on welfare institutions and family support.

TI  - Financial literacy mediates the effect between verbal intelligence and financial anxiety
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
AB  - Financial anxiety can impact financial decision-making negatively. Theoretically, knowledge is considered to help mitigate stress in making decisions. However, the empirical results are inconsistent with respect to the association between financial literacy (knowledge of financial terms and concepts) and financial anxiety, perhaps because of the employment of limited psychometric measures. Furthermore, cognitive intelligence and financial literacy inter-correlate positively, suggesting that any effect between financial literacy and financial anxiety may be accounted for by intelligence, a construct known to facilitate problem solving. Consequently, measures of verbal intelligence (vocabulary and verbal reasoning), financial literacy, and financial anxiety were administered to a sample of 553 adults. Vocabulary and verbal reasoning were found to associate positively with financial literacy, however, only vocabulary associated with financial literacy uniquely. Furthermore, while vocabulary and financial literacy correlated negatively with financial anxiety, the effect between vocabulary and financial anxiety was fully mediated by financial literacy, controlling for education and age. We conclude that financial literacy appears to have a direct effect onto financial anxiety, independently of the effects of verbal intelligence, formal education, and age, supporting the potential usefulness of financial literacy training.

TI  - The role of national culture in financial literacy:Cross-countryevidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - This paper examines the effect of national culture on adult financial literacy levels in 12 countries. Contrary to earlier financial literacy studies, our results are directly comparable across countries given that we use the standardized OECD/INFE financial literacy survey data and Hofstede's, 2001, cultural dimensions to capture financial literacy and national culture. In line with the financial socialization theory, we find that uncertainty avoidance positively influences financial literacy, while individualism negatively influences financial literacy. We conclude that national culture affects financial literacy and that it is important to account for cultural dimensions in future international financial literacy research.

TI  - Improving financial literacy in college of business students: modernizing delivery tools
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop and test through an experiment, an innovative online video teaching module that significantly improves financial literacy in college of business students. Specific business major financial literacy levels are also tested.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 244 college of business students were given a financial literacy test. Half of the students were exposed to the "treatment" (watched a video module), while other half were not. The videos comprised 67 min of micro-lectures that students could download, free of charge, at their own convenience. The researchers analyzed the impact of a previous personal finance course on students' financial literacy levels and tested across four business majors.
   Findings - The video intervention was the most successful at increasing financial literacy, surprisingly more so than having taken a past personal finance course. Interaction effects were not significant. Four college majors were tested with a shorter, improved financial literacy measure - finding, to our surprise that non-quantitative business majors (particularly marketing students) are not less financially literate than other majors. Supporting past research, the authors found that female and African-American college students performed significantly lower on the test.
   Originality/value - The research adds value to the literature by developing and testing a modern, novel teaching innovation to improve financial literacy in young adults. Using an experimental setting, the authors showed that the innovation was more effective than the commonly proscribed personal finance course. This is one of the few studies to measure financial literacy levels for specific college of business majors.

TI  - Role of Banks in Promoting Financial Literacy among Agripreneurs in Assam, India.
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION
AB  - This paper examined financial literacy services provided by banks to agripreneurs and the associated problems. Participants were 500 agripreneurs and 250 bank managers, selected using a multi-stage sampling design in Assam, a north-eastern state of India. The result showed that out of 19 identified variables of financial literacy services, the degree of awareness of agripreneurs by banks is marked very low in 17 variables. In 7-point rating scale, average score of lack of manpower, difficulty in reaching the target group and poor coverage of topics was more than 3.5 which categorised them as major hindrances in conducting Financial Literacy Programme (FLP), particularly for agripreneurs. However, consideration of both organisational and operational approaches is suggested for better implementation of FLP for agripreneurs.

TI  - The impact of financial literacy on negotiation behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This research investigates the role of financial literacy on initiating and achieving a favorable negotiation outcome in an employment context. With a goal of improving long-term financial well-being, extant research examines whether increasing a person's understanding of basic financial concepts ("financial literacy") improves his/her financial decision-making. The current research proposes broader effects of financial literacy via negotiation behavior. We follow prior research to measure financial literacy both objectively (as the accurate assessment of basic financial concepts, "financial knowledge") and subjectively (as confidence in the application of basic financial skills and concepts, "financial confidence"). In a series of studies engaging students from undergraduate business courses and adults recruited from an online crowdsourcing service, this research examines the relationship between these measures of financial literacy and (a) the likelihood of initiating a negotiation and (b) the likely outcome from a negotiation, if initiated. Results suggest that financial confidence impacts participants' willingness to engage in negotiation, while financial knowledge impacts the level of participants' first offer. These findings suggest financial literacy has important implications for career advancement and compensation, as well as the successful management of interpersonal communications, even in fields not traditionally thought of as focusing on numerical reasoning skills.

TI  - Do heuristics matter for financial literacy? The impact of better heuristics awareness to financial literacy
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Policymakers are increasingly focused on improving citizens' financial well-being through better financial literacy. Traditional strategies emphasize financial education to boost financial knowledge, while recently behavioural-based education focus on issues like behavioural biases and emotional influences. This paper suggests a randomized controlled-study to assess if financial education including lessons on heuristics (availability and gambler's fallacy) enhances financial literacy. Results showed that traditional financial education significantly improved financial literacy, while adding heuristics had effect close to zero. This suggests expanding curricula to address rules-of-thumb may not necessarily improve financial literacy, challenging the notion that more complex financial education is always beneficial.

TI  - TOWARDS FINANCIAL LITERACY: A CASE OF SLOVAKIA
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - The level of financial literacy in the Slovak Republic has long been below the European Union average, which is confirmed by several surveys in recent years. In practice, this creates several problems. Almost a million Slovaks have at least one foreclosure, resulting from buying necessities on credit and then living in ever-increasing debt. Knowledge of finance and business among employees or budding entrepreneurs is also problematic. Conservative Slovaks also keep most of their money in products with zero interest and are afraid to invest and capitalize on their savings. The National Bank of Slovakia and the Slovak Bank Association have been calling for a change in school curricula for a long time because financially illiterate pupils eventually become poorly literate clients. The contribution's primary purpose was to analyze the state of financial education in secondary schools in the Slovak Republic, including a more effective design of the content and method of teaching financial literacy. More effective financial education could help reduce poverty in Slovakia and more effective financial and business literacy in society.

TI  - Financial literacy environment scan in Mozambique
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - This research aims to scan financial literacy in Mozambique, assessing its levels and identifying the sociodemographic factors that influence it, generalizing to the developing countries. Quantitative research was performed using a survey database of 3,875 respondents collected in Mozambique. Our results document that more than 61% of the respondents did not answer correctly the questions regarding financial literacy, which indicates that the levels of financial literacy in Mozambique are low. Individuals are not qualified to make the most appropriate financial decisions and end up compromising their financial well-being. It was also found that age impacts respondents' financial knowledge, gender influences financial behavior, educational level influences financial knowledge and behavior, and the training area influences financial knowledge, attitude, and behavior. This article contributes by providing information regarding the financial literacy of Mozambique, which is still scarce and providing a sci-entific basis for decision-makers to improve public policies regarding financial literacy.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY AND FINANCIAL RISK TOLERANCE OF LOTTERY GAMBLERS IN THAILAND
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - This paper investigates the impacts of financial literacy level, financial risk tolerance and demographic characteristics on gambling behavior of informal laborers. The data were analyzed by Multivariate Analysis of Variance and Multinomial Logistic Regression. The total of 995 participants used in this research were collected by Multi-Stage Randomization from the informal laborers in Southern Thailand. The empirical analysis revealed that the financial literacy confidence, the risk tolerance, and the demographic characteristics were significant determinants of the gambler's behavior. The older the gamblers were, the more they got addicted to gambling. Also, the more the people perceived that they have a high level of financial literacy, the more they would gamble. However, it was found that the female laborers were more frequent gamblers than the males. Thus, agencies responsible for supervising the financial education should be aware of the expected outcomes, not only focusing on actual financial literacy, but also supporting the individuals to achieve a healthy level of financial literacy confidence.

TI  - The Behavioural Aspects of Financial Literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the contribution of behavioural characteristics to the financial literacy of UAE residents after controlling for demographic factors. Specifically, we test the relationship between financial literacy and behavioural biases such as representativeness, self-serving, overconfidence, loss aversion, and hindsight bias. Using data collected through survey questionnaires, we apply the methodology developed by the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to compute financial literacy scores. Our overall results show that all behavioural biases except for overconfidence bias are positively related to financial literacy. Furthermore, some biases exhibit a stronger quantitative relationship with financial literacy than others. For example, hindsight bias displays the strongest link to financial literacy, followed by self-serving bias. The weakest but still statistically significant effect is loss aversion bias. Although biases, in general, have negative connotations, behavioural biases appear to be related to higher levels of financial literacy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - We developed and experimentally evaluated four novel educational programs delivered online: an informational brochure, a visual interactive tool, a written narrative, and a video narrative. The programs were designed to inform people about risk diversification, an essential concept for financial decision-making. The effectiveness of these programs was evaluated using the American Life Panel. Participants were exposed to one of the programs, and then asked to answer questions measuring financial literacy - in particular, risk literacy - and self-efficacy. All of the programs were found to be effective at increasing self-efficacy, and several improved financial literacy, providing new evidence for the value of programs designed to improve financial decision-making.

TI  - Financial literacy and sustainability of rural microfinance: The mediating effect of governance
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This research aims to examine the mediating role of microfinance governance in the relationship between financial literacy and microfinance sustainability. The research used the purposive sampling method to collect data from the Women Farmers Group (WFG) "Tapa Walla Badi" in Mbatakapidu village, East Sumba, Indonesia. The survey was conducted from November through December 2021 with the valid sample for analysis was 200 questionnaires. The Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) was used for analysis. The bootstrapping and the Sobel test were required for a better understanding of the findings. Robust test and focus group discussion (FGD) made our methodology more reliable. The findings show that financial literacy plays an important role in the transformation of rural microfinance institutions (MFIs). Financial literacy works positively on the sustainability of rural microfinance via governance. Age, gender, education, and employment situation were taken into account in financial literacy. This research provides a comprehensive view to policymakers in developing rural MFIs, thus implies the urgency to promote financial literacy and improve governance structures within MFIs. The local government may create pro-financial inclusion policies that support sustainable MFIs by implementing financial literacy curriculum in formal and non-formal education.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Financial Performance of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises
T2  - SOUTH EAST ASIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - Research Aims - The study aims to examine the influence of financial literacy on the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data were obtained from questionnaires distributed to 200 SME managers/owners. Multiple regression analysis was applied to test the influence of financial literacy on SMEs performance by controlling manager profile and SME-specific characteristics.
   Research Findings - Multiple regression results prove that financial literacy has a positive and significant impact on SMEs' performance. Managers/owners with financial literacy skills understand business-related financial concepts, including debt, savings, takaful, insurance, and investment, which ensure the good performance of their business.
   Theoretical Contribution/Originality - Similar research has been conducted outside Malaysia. However, there is a need to validate the financial literacy and SME performance relationship in the Malaysian environment due to differences in culture; ways of thinking; and legal, business, and political situations. These differences lead to different responses which then contribute to the way the effect of financial literacy on SME performance is explained. In addition, this study improves the consistency of the existing evidence on SME performance and expands the scope of the Resource-Based View (RBV) from the perspective of SMEs
   Research limitation & implications - Government agencies such as SME Corporation recognise the importance of financial literacy among entrepreneurs. Therefore, proactive efforts need to be accelerated to provide an adequate level of financial literacy among entrepreneurs. Furthermore, entrepreneurial finance can be introduced in formal and non-formal education to ensure that every layer of society enjoys the benefits regardless of their economic status.

T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - Based on data from the 2014 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), this paper investigates the effects of financial literacy on Chinese households' portfolio choices and investment returns from the financial market. We find that financial literacy significantly increases households' investments in risky assets. Financial literacy may have an impact by increasing capacities to understand and compare financial assets. However, we further find that it is not necessary for all investors to have financial knowledge to gain higher investment returns from financial markets. Our results show that financial literacy increases investment returns for younger and better educated households while reducing the returns for older, less educated households.

TI  - ASSET A New Measure of Economic and Financial Literacy
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
AB  - Young adults increasingly require good financial literacy to make the most of the opportunities provided to them. Unfortunately, existing financial literacy measures that may assist with targeting interventions show low reliability, ceiling effects, and a high level of abstraction. To address this, we designed and assessed the psychometric properties of a new measure specifically targeting young people, the Assessment of Economic and Financial Literacy (ASSET). We find it has better overall validity, reliability, and predictive power than existing measures. Using ASSET, we find that mathematical ability, calculator use (an example of deliberative thinking), gender, and socioeconomic status are key predictors of financial literacy. We recommend this more robust tool for use in financial literacy research to assess implications for guiding major financial decisions among young people.

TI  - Revisiting the concept of Islamic financial literacy in a boundaryless context: cross-country comparison of Islamic financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeThere is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of Islamic financial literacy (IFL) while it is at the heart of our understanding of the overall financial system. To date, insufficient attention has been paid to Turkey, the Balkans and other potential Islamic finance hubs like Suriname. In fact, there have been no attempts to examine IFL in those regions or economies. The purpose of this paper is to test and validate the IFL scale developed by Dinc et al. (2021) in an international setting. By doing so, this study elaborates on possible antecedents and levels of IFL across countries and economic systems. Design/methodology/approachThe design of the questionnaire used is based on the principles of Islamic finance and covers all the segments. The total number of collected observations is 3,579. This study uses the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to ascertain the factor structure and test the revised scale fit with the original form. Besides, IBM AMOS 25 Graphics is used for calculating the fit indexes for the scale. FindingsThe results from the CFA revealed that the scale has a good fit for its original and kept the four-dimensional structure. In addition, it also indicates that the predeveloped IFL scale is valid for different cultures, countries and individuals either having conventional or Islamic financial institutions preferences. Furthermore, results of empirical tests demonstrate that Turkey is significantly higher in Islamic financial awareness, whereas other countries' group is higher on all other subdimensions of the scale. On the other hand, female respondents indicate significantly higher levels of Islamic financial awareness, and male respondents show significantly higher levels of Islamic financial knowledge. Finally, the most prominent finding to emerge from the analysis is that the principles of Islamic finance are well accepted, except for some liberal views on the concept of "interest" (riba). Research limitations/implicationsBecause of the diverse demography of the collected sample observations, this revised scale has a homogeneous set of implications. This IFL scale can accurately measure the level of IFL attained by an individual, group, society or nation, as well as suggest necessary actions based on its four-dimensional structure. Originality/valueThis study tests the IFL scale by considering two key elements: increased sample size and vast geographical coverage. To ensure that the developed scale is universal, this study took into account more than 3,000 observations from 28 different countries. These amendments ensure the uniqueness of this paper and its originality.

TI  - The profile of the Portuguese regarding the perception of financial literacy
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify the profile of the Portuguese regarding the perception of financial literacy. Design/methodology/approach The utilized methodology is based on a questionnaire survey that assesses the perception of financial literacy. The sample is composed of 830 Portuguese individuals over 18 years old. Findings The results show that the financial literacy scale presents a tri-factor structure with adequate validity and reliability levels. The three obtained factors are designated 1-2-year financial planning and goals, long-term saving and taste for numeric calculations. Originality/value The originality in this study is shown in the application of the cluster analysis, which demonstrates the formation of three clusters that present different perceptions of financial literacy, classifying the Portuguese into a cluster of high financial literacy and taste for numeric calculation, a cluster of low financial literacy and a cluster of financial planning and saving but without the taste for numeric calculation.

TI  - The importance of the comparative benchmark for measuring composite financial literacy with survey data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionUsing survey data to calculate composite financial literacy (CFL), existed studies do not consider the geographical difference of the means of objectively-measured financial literacy and subjectively-perceived financial literacy, i.e., comparative benchmark. MethodsTaking the survey data of National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) for example, we explain why it is more reasonable to use the within-state average rather than the national average of financial literacy as the comparative benchmark to measure CFL. Then we use NFCS 2009, 2012, 2015 and 2018 dataset to comparatively analyze the difference between CFL measured with the two benchmarks. ResultsThe results of statistical analysis show that there is a great difference among the four groups of CFL measured with the two benchmarks, and 10.7% of respondents are categorized as a particular group of CFL incorrectly for all datasets. Additionally, the findings of spatial distribution analysis unveils that 36, 19, 15, and 6 states have respondents miscategorized in the four groups of CFL for 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018 respectively, in which the highest proportion of the population miscategorized in a state is up to 49.91%. Finally, we find that several groups of CFL measured with the two benchmarks have significantly different effects on stock market participation behavior. DiscussionUsing the national average as a benchmark to determine all the respondents' relative financial literacy levels for different states is not meaningful, and will lose the practical appeal to tackle the regional inequalities of financial literacy among the households. Therefore, we suggest that the within-state average of financial literacy, not the national average, should be taken as the comparative benchmark for identifying the more precise groups of CFL in survey.

TI  - Financial literacy, confidence and financial advice seeking
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - We find that people with higher confidence in their own financial literacy are less likely to seek financial advice, but no relation between objective measures of literacy and advice seeking. The negative association between confidence and advice seeking is more pronounced among wealthy households. We base these findings on the analysis of two rich data sources from the Netherlands: the DNB Household survey and a sample of investors from a large Dutch retail bank. Our results imply that policy makers should be careful to put financial advice forward as a mechanism to curb the ill effects of low financial literacy and that steering people towards more accurate self-assessments seems a more promising route.

TI  - Financial Literacy Perception Scale for the Portuguese Population
T2  - SCIENTIFIC ANNALS OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This study aims to propose and validate a financial literacy perception scale for the Portuguese population. The utilized methodology was quantitative, based on a two-part questionnaire survey. The first part studies the sociodemographic profile and the second part evaluates the respondent's perception of financial literacy. The sample consisted of 830 Portuguese individuals, over 18 years old. The main results of this study demonstrate that the financial literacy perception scale presents a tri-factorial structure with satisfactory validity and reliability levels. The three obtained factors are 1-2 years financial planning and goals, long term savings and an affinity for numerical calculation. This study contributes to the increase of scientific knowledge in the field of financial literacy, to the assistance of financial education policymakers in the reformulation of their policies and to the creation of tools to help consumer financial behavior.

TI  - Is there a link between financial literacy and financial behaviour?
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - In this paper, we are motivated by the growing complexity of financial service products amidst an unending wave of Ponzi schemes as well as the low levels of financial literacy reported by prior studies. Particularly, while the extant literature has focused on various determinants of financial literacy, limited insights exist on the implications of financial literacy on financial behaviour. Consequently, we focus our empirical test on identifying the link between financial literacy and financial behaviour. We formulated our hypotheses from the family resource management theory which postulates that individual behaviour is a function of their knowledge. Thus, relative to financial literacy and financial behaviour, we argue that financially literate individuals are more likely to exhibit sound financial behaviour than those who are financially illiterate. We tested our hypothesis by using the logistic regression technique on a cross-sectional sample of 3,932 students pursuing various undergraduate and postgraduate programs in Ghanaian public and private universities. Notably, we selected our respondents from six (6) public and six (6) private universities. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, our results show that financially literate students are more likely to exhibit sound financial behaviour. Specifically, the results demonstrate that financial literacy is a major input for financial behaviour. Additionally, we observe that variables such as family characteristics particularly the father's educational background, and discussion of financial matters at home are significant predictors of sound financial behaviour. Generally, our results have implications for various stakeholders including governments, academic institutions, and families.

TI  - Urbanization and financial literacy: the knowledge spillover effect
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - Using the dataset of the 2015 wave of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), this paper examines how urbanization influences individuals' financial literacy. We demonstrate that the financial knowledge of urban natives spills to rural-urban migrants in the process of urbanization and urban agglomeration. We address the potential endogeneity issue by taking advantage of China's land expropriation policy. Our results are robust to identification regressions and a series of robustness checks. Further mechanism analysis shows that the financial literacy spillover effect works mainly through social networks.

TI  - Financial literacy in Tunisia: Its determinants and its implications on investment behavior
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Given the dynamic changes in the economic environment, especially in financial markets, a need is felt to improve investors' financial knowledge. Financial literacy entails informed financial decisions. The present study investigates the determinants of financial literacy and its impact on investment behavior. A questionnaire has been developed to elicit the study's variables and it is divided into three parts. The first part covers the demographic variables; the second deals with the financial behavior of the Tunisian households, and the third part is devoted to financial literacy.
   The study's findings are two fold: First, individuals with a low level of financial literacy are less likely to invest in the stock market. Second, the financial literacy level is found to be affected by age, education level, and the annual income. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy-related financial literacy and electricity consumption: Survey-based evidence from Finland
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - We provide new insights into (i) the level of energy-related financial literacy in Finnish households, (ii) the sociodemographic characteristics that affect energy-related financial literacy, and (iii) whether energy-related financial literacy influences household electricity consumption. We use a data set consisting of energy-related financial literacy questions combined with monthly electricity consumption data. We draw from the recent literature on energy-related financial literacy and suggest two new variables based on subjective perceptions on energy-related financial literacy. Gender has a strong association with energy-related financial literacy. Our results also indicate that households of respondents with higher levels of energy-related financial literacy tend to consume less electricity when we control for other factors such as dwelling and household characteristics. This implies that measures to promote energy-related financial literacy might guide consumers' decisions toward energy efficiency and conservation.

TI  - Is More Financial Literacy Always Beneficial? An Investigation through a Mediator
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - We study the impact of financial literacy on financial risk preference. When financial literacy is measured jointly by actual and self-assessed scores, we find compelling evidence of a valley-shaped relationship between actual financial literacy and risk preference. At a given level of self-assessment, as actual financial literacy increases, the willingness to take risks initially decreases and then rises. Actual financial literacy is modeled to impact risk preference through self-assessed financial literacy, the mediator; this mediation effect is significant. Furthermore, increasing actual financial literacy has a positive (negative) effect in underconfident (overconfident) individuals on several financial behaviors.

TI  - Financial literacy, financial development, and leverage of small firms
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - This study examines the relationship between financial literacy and the leverage of small firms, specifically of the legal forms, sole proprietorships, and partnerships. Using a cross-section of 73,302 firms in 22 countries, we find that the leverage of small firms is negatively associated with financial literacy. Further, we explore the role of financial development, bankruptcy and transaction costs, and information asymmetry, in moderating the rela-tionship. We find that the negative relationship is less pronounced in countries with lower financial development, high bankruptcy and transaction costs, and high information asymmetry environments, respectively. We contribute to the understanding of small firms' leverage and the literature on financial literacy, SMEs, finance, and entrepreneurship. This study offers policy implications for economies that promote SMEs for entrepre-neurship training and development.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Health Engagement, and Residents' Health: Evidence from China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This study took residents' health level as the research object, adopted the perspective of financial literacy, and used the 2014-2018 China Family Panel Studies data to analyze the impact of financial literacy on the residents' health. The study found that financial literacy could have a significant positive impact on the residents' health, with long-term effects. Furthermore, it promoted the residents' health engagement and improved their health through the intermediary effects of income and health expenditure. In addition, the impact of financial literacy on the residents' health was heterogeneous between urban and rural areas. Compared with the case for rural residents, the improvement of financial literacy significantly improved the health of the urban residents. The outcomes of this research were the exploration of means to improve residents' health from a new economic perspective, promote residents' health engagement, and improve residents' health.

TI  - Financial literacy and formal credit accessibility: Evidence from informal businesses in China
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - There is a sizable informal business sector in emerging markets. This paper investigates informal businesses' accessibility to formal credit in China and their owners' financial literacy as a potential determinant. By examining informal businesses in urban areas from the 2015 China Household Finance Survey, we find that business owners' financial literacy is positively associated with the likelihood of their businesses holding bank loans. This positive relationship only exists among businesses whose owners have rural hukou and it is more pronounced in areas where formal-credit accessibility is lower.

TI  - A Situated Learning Approach to Measuring Financial Literacy Self-Efficacy of Youth
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - In setting a new direction for the field by highlighting the importance of measure development, this article offers an original approach to modeling financial literacy, in which theories of situated learning meet self-efficacy: an approach that we claim fits well with the aims of program evaluation. It presents results from the validation of a new set of measures, intended for use with 16- to 19-year-olds, of financial literacy self-efficacy pertaining to contexts such as the classroom or the everyday activity of personal banking. Self-efficacy implies a domain in which confidence is measured specific to that context in this case financial literacy. The data were collected in the United Kingdom from high school and college students enrolled in an optional certificate course in personal financial management. The measures were validated on a subset (n = 171) of a larger sample and was an off-shoot project of a larger 3-year evaluation study of the financial literacy certificate course (n = 2,000), which provided additional mixed-methods data used in validation. Correlation analysis supports the contention incorporated within the framework presented-that self-efficacy is context-specific and so measures of self-efficacy must adequately reflect the contexts in which the associated literacies reside.

AB  - We have conducted a survey to determine the relationship between financial literacy and crypto market participation. Furthermore, we have included overconfidence and risk lover tendency, which are considered behavioral biases, in our models along with financial literacy. Logistic regression results revealed striking findings on financial literacy and crypto market participation. Our analysis shows that financial literacy has a positive significant impact on crypto market participation. Specifically, advanced financial literates are more likely to engage in crypto markets than basic financial literates. Confidence in financial decisions and risk - lover tendency also positively affect crypto investments, however these effects are insignificant. Apart from this, we determined a relationship between participation behavior and other control variables such as age, gender and investing in traditional assets. Lastly, we focus on Turkish crypto investors and find significant differences in respect of demographic factors in financial literacy and behavioral biases

AB  - The present research work analyzed the level of digital financial literacy of graduate and post graduate students of Saurashtra region. The objective of research was to study the relationship between demographic variables and level of digital financial literacy. It was also aimed at exploring the relationship between digital financial literacy and use of digital financial services. Digital Financial Literacy was measured using three dimensions: knowledge of digital financial products and services, awareness of digital financial risk and its control and knowledge of consumer rights and redress procedures. For measurement of digital financial literacy, 135 students were selected using convenient sampling method and data were collected using structured questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS. We found that on an average 47 per cent of students answered digital financial literacy questions correctly with median score of 57. The demographic variables like age and education significantly affect the level of digital financial literacy. However, Male and female students do not have significant differences with respect to the level of digital financial literacy score. We found that there is a gap between level of digital financial literacy and usage of digital financial services.

T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - Gender differences in financial literacy are examined in this research. A considerable body of research suggests women are inferior to men when it comes to financial literacy. Various social factors (e.g., gender inequality) are typically attributed as antecedents of this reality. We set out to investigate whether gender differences in financial literacy are present in Iceland, the most gender-equal country in the world. If financial literacy is based on social norms and issues, gender differences in financial literacy should be less in countries like Iceland, where women are highly economically and otherwise empowered. Using a representative sample from the Icelandic population and controlling for a host of factors, we find women to be less financially literate than men despite substantial gender equality in Iceland.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Economic Growth: How Eastern Europe is Doing?
T2  - ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL
AB  - In this study, we aim to analyse financial literacy as a driver of financial wellbeing and economic growth in three of the most recent EU Member States, namely Romania, Bulgaria, and Croatia. Our particular interest in studying more in-depth these three countries is generated by their difficult pathway in the transition to the Euro and economic convergence on one side and by the limited analysis carried out so far in relation to them on the other side. Various studies indicate that financial literacy is associated with wealth accumulation, and financial education can help achieve economic growth. To conduct the empirical analysis, in this study, we have used primary data provided by the OECD for our specific research purposes. The raw data were collected in a survey carried out in 2019 in seven South Eastern European countries reaching over 1,000 respondents for each country. We used two-stage least-squares regression to test our hypothesis and cluster analysis for comparisons among countries. Conclusions of our research reveal the main differences between countries in terms of financial literacy and reverse causality between financial literacy and economic growth for the analysed countries. Finally, the study gives some insights into the future design of public policies on financial education in these countries.

TI  - Financial literacy and fraud detection--Evidence from China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This paper investigates whether and how financial literacy could help improve fraud detection. Results demonstrate that fraud-detection ability increases with the improvement in one's financial literacy. In addition, several other variables such as one's participation in economic activities, having a healthy or risk-preferred household head, as well as active social interaction all show positive impacts on fraud detection. In contrast, some psychological factors, such as trusting strangers and regional factors like income inequality can have negative effects on it. Two potential mechanisms, the utilization of information channels and that of asset allocation channels, may help to develop this relationship.

TI  - Gender difference in overconfidence and household financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE
AB  - We study overconfidence related to financial knowledge among men and women within U.S. households, venturing beyond prior research confined to subsamples such as CEOs, retail investors, and older adults. By expanding our study to the broader U.S. population, we provide evidence that women, on average, exhibit greater overconfidence than men - a discrepancy attributable to the gender difference in financial knowledge. We find a positive association between overconfidence and both investment risk-taking and savings behavior, while it correlates inversely with prudent credit card management. Our findings emphasize the instrumental role of financial literacy in mitigating overconfidence, providing a deeper understanding of the interaction between gender, overconfidence, and financial literacy. Our results carry profound implications for policy interventions and educational strategies.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Heuristic Driven Biases: The Role of Risk Perception
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This study scrutinizes the relationship between the investor's financial literacy and heuristic-driven biases (Overconfidence, Representativeness, Availability, and Anchoring Bias). Further, it attempts to examine the mediating role of risk perception. We collected the data from 492 individual investors in India using a structured questionnaire. We adapted the questionnaire items from the benchmarked literature scales on financial literacy and heuristic-driven biases. The authors employed structural equation modelling to evaluate the proposed relationship between financial literacy and heuristic-driven biases. The process macro was employed to measure the mediating role between the mentioned constructs. The study demonstrates that financial literacy is inversely related to overconfidence and anchoring bias. Furthermore, risk perception fully mediates the relationship between financial literacy and representativeness bias. The key findings could be helpful for financial advisors dealing with their clients. The study could provide insights to the Government and private bodies working with the assumption that financial literacy reduces investment biases. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the impact of financial literacy on investment biases dealing with mental shortcuts. The study is vital to comprehend the impact of financial literacy on decision-making heuristics and the role of risk perception in the mentioned constructs.

TI  - Financial literacy, behavioral traits, and ePayment adoption and usage in Japan
T2  - FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB  - This study investigates how financial literacy and behavioral traits affect the adoption of electronic payment (ePayment) services in Japan. We construct a financial literacy index using a representative sample of 25,000 individuals from the Bank of Japan's 2019 Financial Literacy Survey. We then analyze the relationship between this index and the extensive and intensive usage of two types of payment services: electronic money (e-money) and mobile payment apps. Using an instrumental variable approach, we find that higher financial literacy is positively associated with a higher likelihood of adopting ePayment services. The empirical results suggest that individuals with higher financial literacy use payment services more frequently. We also find that risk-averse people are less likely to adopt and use ePayment services, whereas people with herd behavior tend to adopt and use ePayment services more. Our empirical results also suggest that the effects of financial literacy on the adoption and use of ePayment differ among people with different behavioral traits.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY AND RELATED OUTCOMES: THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION SOURCES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate consumers' preferences in different financial information sources and their impact on financial literacy. This study also aims to examine the impacts of financial literacy on the amount of income allocated for investment, as well as the hiring of a financial planner. A large-scale survey was conducted in Malaysia, and a total of 2000 usable responses were collected. The results showed that (1) there is a negative effect of preference in media, family and peers as financial information sources on financial literacy; (2) there is a positive effect of preference in financial planners as a financial information source on financial literacy; (3) consumers who use the Internet as their main financial information source exhibit higher financial literacy; (4) financial literacy positively influences the amount of income allocated for investment; and (5) financial literacy is negatively related to the likelihood of hiring a financial planner. This study provides empirical evidence for practitioners to improve financial literacy by encouraging the use of appropriate financial information sources. This study also offers an understanding on consumers' financial behaviors, which result from different levels of financial literacy.

TI  - Financial literacy and the household participation in commercial insurance: Evidence from China
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Utilizing China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data in 2017, this study examines the influence of financial literacy on household commercial insurance engagement. Empirical findings reveal that higher financial literacy correlates with increased likelihood and expenditure on commercial insurance. Education level and trust in commercial insurance also significantly enhance market participation. The study also discovers that financial literacy interacts with entrepreneurship, positively affecting family insurance purchasing behaviors. Particularly, financial literacy more significantly promotes insurance purchases in less educated families and communities with lower purchasing rates. In conclusion, our research not only contributes to enriching the study on the real effects of financial literacy, but also provides policy guidelines for governments on enhancing household participation in commercial insurance markets.

TI  - Does Citizens' Financial Literacy Relate to Bank Financial Reporting Transparency?
T2  - EUROPEAN ACCOUNTING REVIEW
AB  - In this study, we examine the relationship between financial literacy and bank financial reporting transparency for a sample of banks from the U.S. Following prior literature, we employ discretionary loan loss provisions (DLLP) as our primary measure of bank reporting transparency. We argue that the financial literacy of their customers can influence bank managers' behaviors with respect to both the mechanics of the loan loss provisioning and their opportunistic actions. Financially literate customers represent more stable sources of funding and have more predictable loan loss provisioning that contributes to more persistent earnings. Financial literacy could also enhance customers' ability to indirectly follow and monitor bank performance and risk-taking. Therefore, bank managers will be less likely to engage in opportunistic earnings manipulation. Following these arguments, we predict that citizens' financial literacy is positively associated with bank financial reporting transparency. Consistent with our prediction, we find that the magnitude of bank DLLP is negatively related to state-level financial literacy. Moreover, the association between financial literacy and DLLP is higher for banks with more retail deposits and larger consumer loans, the two channels through which financial literacy could influence bank transparency.

TI  - VALIDATING ISLAMIC FINANCIAL LITERACY INSTRUMENTS AMONG MUM GENERATION: RASCH ANALYSIS APPROACH
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - Islamic financial literacy is an emerging term which is increasingly used in research and policy. Though a study in this area is growing, there is a lack of an accepted method to measure Islamic financial literacy. This study aims to develop a valid and reliable instrument to access Islamic financial literacy among MUM (Muslim Urban Millennial) generations using Rasch analysis. A comprehensive literature review and a qualitative study were initially performed to identify the construct of Islamic financial literacy. A total of 109 respondents from MUM generation completed the 18-item instrument with multiple-choice questions. However, only 85 final sample out of 109 data measured after eliminating the person with the extreme score. The dimensionality of the items was evaluated using WINSTEPS 3.73. Results show that the measurements model is highly reliable with a reliability alpha of 0.87 and 0.96 for person and item, respectively. There is also six misfit item that needs to be reviewed or removed. Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analysis shows that three items have a bias between gender. Overall, the developed Islamic financial literacy scale is a valid and reliable instrument to measure Islamic financial literacy in MUM generation. This measure lays a solid empirical and theoretical foundation for future research in Islamic financial literacy among the MUM generation.

TI  - Financial literacy and voluntary savings for retirement: novel causal evidence
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - We utilise recent Household Finance and Consumption Survey microdata to report first causal effects of financial literacy on voluntary private pension schemes participation for a Central and Eastern European (CEE) country, namely Slovakia. Savings for retirement in the supplementary pension schemes are positively associated with financial literacy after controlling for a set of relevant socio-economic variables. One additional correctly answered financial literacy question leads to a 5.6 percentage points increase in the probability of having a voluntary pension savings plan in our ordinary least squares estimates. The causal impact of financial literacy increases to 19.5 percentage points when we address potential endogeneity problems by novel to the literature instrumental variables.

TI  - Green Microfinance and Women's Empowerment: Why Does Financial Literacy Matter?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study investigated the role of financial literacy in the relationship between women's empowerment and green microfinance. We set a conceptual model with green microfinance as an outcome variable, financial literacy as a mediating variable, and women's empowerment as an exposure variable. Variance-based SEM was employed for analysis. The results show that the exposure and mediating variables have a significant direct and indirect impact on the outcome variable. The relationship between women's empowerment and green microfinance is partially mediated by financial literacy. Local wisdom-based financial literacy is found to be an alternative for mainstreaming women's empowerment in local development. In addition, gender-targeted programs need to consider pro-literacy policies for achieving green microfinance sustainability. By using financial literacy as a mediating variable, this study contributes to the current literature on the relationship between women's empowerment and green microfinance.

TI  - Role of Parental Financial Socialisation on Financial Literacy among Youth
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The purpose of the study is to investigate the role of parental financial socialization on the financial literacy among the youth between the age group of 15-24. The study analyzed four variables of parental financial socialization on the financial literacy. Parental financial socialization is the deliberate process of bringing up the children in such a way that the financial knowledge, skills and attitude is being transferred, which may reflect in their financial behavior and outcomes. These variables were identified based on the relationship exhibited, financial decision making, teaching method adopted and responsiveness that the parent and child may share. As it is evident from the existing literatures that parental financial socialization is identified as the primary factor which influences the financial knowledge and behavior of any individual, the effort was made to focus on the younger generation based on the selected variables namely financial teaching and monitoring, financial budgeting, parental relationship and parental responsiveness. Financial literacy plays a vital role in the capital formation, thereby leading to productive investments and ultimately to the economic development of the country. Financial literacy has three dimensions, which includes financial knowledge, attitude and behavior. The study only focused on the awareness and attitude of the youth based on the family socialization.The data was randomly collected from 100 respondents by framing a structured questionnaire from the state of Kerala.The data analysis was doneon the parental influence to the financial literacy by conducting regression analysis on financial literacy and the four variables of parental financial socialization. It was found that the financial teaching and monitoring is not having a significant relationship with financial literacy. It was also found that, the most influencing variables being parental relationship with their children and family budgeting by the involvement of the youth.The overall effect of the variables on the financial literacy was made by using multiple linear regression. The results indicate that the four variables under the study are not much explaining their effect on the financial literacy, as such the inference is drawn as parental socialization factors have no significant effect on the financial literacy among the youth. The financial literacy and its effect on the demographic variables like gender, educational qualification and employment status was made. The result from the study indicated that male youth were more inclined to financial knowledge than the counterpart. But the Mann Whitney U test indicates that there is no gender difference. The educational qualification possessed by the youth does not indicate a positive relationship with the literacy. It was found that the financial literacy is different among the employed youth and the unemployed youth.One third of the sample indicated that they were unaware of the importance of savings as they were not motivated by their parents to make them save, when they were between the age of 8-15. The study tries to shed some lights on the increasing need for parental involvement in bringing up the youth so as to make them more inclined to savings and investment.

TI  - A glimpse of the complexity of factors that influence financial literacy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Financial literacy has been recognised as a vital life skill, but there is little evidence of the factors behind the differences in managing personal finance. Socio-economic factors and the provision of financial education do explain the variance in financial literacy in some countries, but not in all. In the PISA 2012 financial literacy test, Estonian students ranked very highly in international comparison; although only a few had received financial education at school. Compared with other countries, socio-economic factors explained the smallest proportion of variance in the test score. There was, however, a significant difference between the mean financial literacy scores of Estonian- and Russian-language communities. The aim of the article is to analyse the factors behind the differences in financial literacy when financial education is not provided. It also offers insight into how students in a similar education system in two different cultural and language frameworks achieve different financial literacy scores. Moreover, the results demonstrate how indicators, such as family background can work through different channels as opposed to the usual parental education or occupation based socio-economic indicators. The latter implies that unexplained factors remain, such as cultural, developmental and societal indicators, which most researchers pay little attention to when explaining efficient policies for improving financial literacy. Multivariate regression models show that the level of financial literacy in Estonia is correlated with gender, language of the school, the number of books at home, mathematics and reading scores. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition explains less than half of the gap between the two communities. The only variable significantly explaining the gap is the number of books at home. Books can be interpreted as a symbol of social status, evidence of cultural background or source of influence for broader picture and better problem solving skills.

TI  - Advanced Financial Literacy of Malaysian Gen Y Investors and Its Consequences
T2  - MARGIN-JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMIC RESEARCH
AB  - This article presents the advanced financial literacy of Malaysian Gen Y investors and investigates whether literacy varies across demographics and ethnicity, and how financial literacy is related to investing decisions. In a survey-based study (N = 231) with the estimation of crosstab, ordered logistic regression and binary logistic regression, the results suggest that Gen Y investors display a medium level of financial literacy and that investors with certain demographic characteristics and ethnicity display a relatively higher level of financial literacy. Literacy items such as knowledge of stocks and bonds, functioning of the stock market, working of long-term bonds and mutual funds, and riskiness of bonds versus stocks are more closely related to investors' trading, risky share investment, willingness of risk-taking, stock market participation and perceived portfolio returns. The results imply a clear scope to improve Gen Y investors' financial literacy by concentrating on a certain socio-demographic groups and specific financial literacy items.

TI  - Towards Improving Households' Investment Choices in Tanzania: Does Financial Literacy Really Matter?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - This paper primarily aims to assess the impact of financial literacy on households' investment choices. The paper employs secondary data from the FinScope survey (2017) conducted by Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSDT). In particular, the study aims at establishing whether the choices of investment platforms are influenced by the financial literacy level of the heads of households. To do so, the study employed both bivariate and multivariate analytical techniques. The study finds that financial literacy is positively and significantly associated with household investment choices. More specifically, as households become more financially literate, they divert from investing in informal groups towards more formal investment platforms such as investment accounts, agricultural ventures as well as personal business. Such observations may be partly attributable to the facts that individuals whose financial literacy is sound enough are more likely to be equipped with skills and knowledge of risks associated with investment opportunities and some other several financial products. The study also reveals that financial literacy is significantly associated with households' socio-demographic factors, and that the adult population exhibits a large financial literacy gap and, therefore, adults should not be considered as a homogenous group-instead, gender, age, education and income levels of the households, which are showcased in this study, should also be taken into consideration. The study opines that, because most of households, as revealed in the survey from which the employed dataset is based, are hailing from rural settings where agriculture is the main economic activity, we establish that agricultural ventures require a complete revamp for Tanzania to become a middle-income economy through its industrialization agenda. The study also proposes the financial literacy programmes to be rolled on to students from early stage of their education such as secondary schools.

TI  - The impact of financial literacy and financial interest on risk tolerance
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - We investigate and compare the effects of financial literacy and financial interest on risk tolerance, evaluating not only at the means, but also the whole distribution. We use a unique sample of 12,156 Swedish bank customers combining bank-register data with survey data. Results show that both financial literacy and financial interest are associated with higher risk tolerance. They further show that the impact of financial interest is significantly higher than the impact of financial literacy. Differences are also observed across the distribution. Quantile regressions show that financial interest has its greatest association at the medium-to-high range of risk tolerance, whereas financial literacy shows its greatest association at the lower range of risk tolerance. Findings contribute to the literature on risk tolerance, specifically pointing to the relevance of the noncognitive trait; interest, to individuals' risk tolerance. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Fintech literacy among millennials: The roles of financial literacy and education
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - While readily available fintech products are in rise for consumers, the lack of basic fintech literacy (FTL) may preclude them fully utilize its benefits. This study aims to investigate FTL, and then identifies if actual financial literacy, perceived financial literacy and demography predict FTL. Using millennials from Malaysia, the study reports that (a) millennials show medium level of FTL; (b) they display higher literacy on P2P lending, but lower on machine learning; (c) high fintech literacy millennials are male, younger, Chinese and highly educated; (d) actual financial literacy is positively associated with machine learning and crowdfunding literacy, whereas perceived financial literacy is negatively associated with robo-advisor's literacy; (e) education has a significant positive impact on fintech's definition, machine learning, blockchain, P2P lending and crowdfunding; (f) age has an inverse relationship with cryptocurrency and blockchain literacy. Ethnicity and gender also contribute to FTL. Implications are discussed for millennials and fintech service providers.

TI  - Can personality traits influence Brazilian university students' financial literacy?
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The objective of the present study is to assess the financial literacy levels of students at a Brazilian university and investigate how these levels are affected by profile characteristics and personality traits. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected using SurveyMonkey, and a link to the questionnaire was sent by e-mail. The questionnaire contains three blocks of questions: demographics, financial literacy and personality traits. Ordered logistic regression was applied to a sample of 1,312 students. Findings Younger participants, those with higher incomes and men were more likely to have a high level of financial literacy. The same was true of those who were less extrovert, i.e. assertive, sociable, optimistic and communicative students. These results contribute to the field by indicating which population segments should be prioritized in efforts to promote financial literacy. Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, no study has compared Financial Literacy and Personality Traits in Brazil, a developing country that is only beginning to develop national financial literacy strategies.

TI  - Attitudinal factors, financial literacy, and stock market participation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the influence of factors such as financial literacy on a consumer's investment decisions, particularly in the stock market. Based on two empirical studies, the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) was used to understand stock market participation (SMP) in India while developing a model to represent the relationships between the various factors. Consumer financial literacy was conceptualised to be a part of perceived behavioural control and included in the TPB.
   Design/methodology/approach - A mixed methods research was followed where qualitative research preceded a quantitative survey-based study. In-depth interviews were conducted with investors and experts, results of which, when combined with the literature review, revealed seven variables including financial literacy which were pooled into three distinct groups based on the TPB. Responses obtained from 506 retail investors from four cities in India were analysed. Structural equation modelling was used to test the models and arrive at a final empirical model.
   Findings - Results of the study indicated that investment intention predicts actual investments in the stock market (which represented behaviour). Financial literacy - both subjective and objective - were also found to be significant influencers on intention while only objective financial literacy seemed to affect behaviour. Three variables - perception of regulator, risk avoidance, and hassle factor - were combined to form a second-order construct which was named "Attitude to Investment Behaviour". This had a negative impact on intention to invest in the equity markets. Financial well-being seemed to have a negative impact on intention while having a positive relationship with behaviour.
   Practical implications - The results present significant investor behaviour and policy implications for financial services marketing. Some interventions, especially in the area of consumer financial literacy, are more likely than others to help consumers bridge the gap between non-participation and participation in the stock market.
   Originality/value - The study makes a contribution to investor behaviour theory in the form of a comprehensive model to explain SMP in an emerging market. This can be further tested across geographies.

TI  - Residential renewable energy adoption. Does financial literacy matter?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Clean energy production systems are the most effective and sustainable ways of protecting the natural environment from pollution. Sadly, fossil fuels remain a significant energy source in most emerging economies primarily due to financial challenges. Using Ghana's renewable energy policy initiatives as a case analysis, the study adopted a multiple-stage random sampling approach to sample household heads (N = 413) across two regions in Ghana to assess the adoption of renewable energies' impact of financial literacy among urban households by applying the two-stage residual inclusion technique. The study's findings depict that household income and RE cost are more significant variables impacting RE adoption, whereas the focal study variable, i.e., financial literacy, has some positive effect but at a lower level than these two variables (household income and RE cost). The heterogeneous analysis regarding household income level shows that financial literacy increases the ability to adopt renewable energy in high-income households than low-income households, confirming the significant impact of household income on RE adoption. The study results imply that policymakers in low-income countries should provide tax incentives for importers of renewable energy products/appliances and subsidize the prices for consumers to improve renewable energy technology use. Also, the provision of job opportunities and income diversification strategies education to improve household incomes should be a priority. Moreover, financial literacy through financial education programs in the formal education sector and the mass media to improve citizens' financial skills and knowledge should be prioritized. These recommendations have the potential to advance the financial and economic wellbeing of citizens in facilitating renewable energy transition.

TI  - Does parental socialization affect financial literacy in Indonesia?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES
AB  - The technological advancement of Industry 4.0 embarked on a trend of digital payment in Indonesia to promote a cashless society. However, the rapid advancement of financial digitalization in the world should be prepared for the changes of a well-literate society. In Indonesia, a cashless society has been intensively promoted. But the low level of literacy index from its younger generation, this campaign has struggled. Among several factors, this study seeks to investigate the effect of parental socialization on improving financial literacy from this generation dominated by undergraduate students in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. This study is designed using qualitative and quantitative approaches. The qualitative data was collected by interviewing as many as 10 parents. Also, the quantitative data were gathered by distributing the online survey questionnaire to 204 public, and private undergraduate students aged 20-24 in Bandung using Google form started January to May 2020. The data collection process was chosen to solve some constraints during the pandemic of COVID-19. This study has successfully produced a conceptual framework based on parents' perspectives. Through a data analysis process using multiple linear regression, this study found that money allowance and trust variables significantly positively affect financial literacy among undergraduate students in Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. In conclusion, this study has successfully investigated the effect of parental socialization on improving financial literacy. The parents' decisions will determine their children's proficiency in money management. Also, this study found a new model that differs from the previously developed model in the United States. For the Bandung context, these two factors are perceived as effective socialization factors from the perspective of undergraduate students.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Risk Aversion, Financial Performance, and Innovative Behavior in Indonesian SMEs
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
AB  - Lampung is one of the provinces that makes a major contribution to the Indonesian economy. The aim was to investigate the relationship between financial literacy and risk aversion on financial performance with innovative behavior as the mediating variable. The population were the SMEs in Lampung and a sample of 284 were selected. Structural equation modeling was used to test the research hypothesis. The research findings show that financial literacy had a positive direct effect on financial performance (beta= .27, rho = .006), risk aversion had a positive direct effect on financial performance (beta= .21, rho = .000), risk aversion, which had a positive direct effect on innovative behavior (beta= .16, rho = .005). Financial literacy was found to had a positive direct effect on innovative behavior (beta= .73, rho = .000); and innovative behavior had a positive direct effect on financial performance (beta= .39, rho = .000). When innovative behavior entered the relationship between financial literacy and financial performance, the direct effect (beta= .04, rho = .000) was significant. When innovative behavior was introduced into the link between risk aversion and financial success, the direct effect was significant (beta= .34, rho = .01). As a result, innovative behavior is regarded as a moderator of financial literacy and risk aversion on financial performance. This study elaborates on the ways that SME owners can improve their financial success by enhancing their financial literacy and embracing innovative behaviors that will ultimately benefit their business.

TI  - On the financial literacy, indebtedness, and wealth of Colombian households
T2  - REVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
AB  - In this paper we attempt to find existing linkages of financial literacy with indebtedness and wealth accumulation of households in Bogota, the capital of Colombia. We analyze an econometric model where we regress a household's debt usage, cost of debt servicing, and wealth indicators against its financial literacy. Financial literacy is assessed according to the financial numeracy and money management skills of the head of households. Numeracy skills are found to have a positive correlation with the decision to use debt and have a mortgage and with the total number of lending sources, debt-to-income, and net worth. Money management skills decrease the household's likelihood of using all of the debt types considered in the analysis and increase with net worth. We also uncover important debt and wealth accumulation conducts closely tied to the city's economic stratification and the gender of the head of household. A number of public policy implications are derived from the results of the analysis.

TI  - How does financial literacy influence undergraduates' risk-taking propensity?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
AB  - Previous evidence is contradictory about the financial literacy-individual's risk-taking propensity relationship. Therefore, this article attempts to examine the relationship between financial literacy and risk-taking propensity in a university environment, considering for the first time the financial literacy's multidimensional nature (i.e., financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial behaviour). Applying Covariance-Based Structural Equation Models to 568 Spanish undergraduates, our results show that: (1) financial knowledge and financial behaviour directly and positively affect risk-taking propensity; (2) financial attitude indirectly and positively affects risk-taking propensity through financial behaviour. These findings are relevant since they provide new insights into the association mechanism that explains the financial literacy-undergraduates' risk-taking propensity relationship.

TI  - How do demographic and socioeconomic factors affect financial literacy and its variables?
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate various relationships between demographic and socioeconomic factors and financial literacy variables. Instead of using two or three variables as commonly adopted in the literature, this study employed multivariable analysis to investigate financial literacy. The sample of this research was 255 faculty members on Java Island, Indonesia. This study was a discrete moderator test; therefore, it employed a multigroup analysis (MGA) via the partial least squares of structural equations modeling (PLS-SEM) to determine which group of demographics and socioeconomic factors influencing the relationship of the financial literacy variables. This study revealed that demographic factors of sex, age, and specialization affected different relationship of financial skills, knowledge, capability, awareness, experience, goal, and financial decision. This study also provided empirical evidence that the socioeconomic factor of consumption spending affected the different relationships between financial awareness and skills. The results proved that demographic and socioeconomic factors enhanced financial literacy. Assessing financial literacy levels in different demographic and socioeconomic factors, as a key factor in accomplishing a successful national strategy for financial education, allows policymakers to identify gaps and design appropriate responses. This result emphasizes that strengthening awareness and experience as future orientations could improve financial literacy levels in developing countries.

TI  - Does financial literacy alleviate risk attitude and risk behavior inconsistency?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between risk preference and risk behavior using the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). Empirical results suggest the existence of an inconsistency between risk preference and risk behavior; however, financial literacy affects this inconsistency. Financial literacy works through two channels. First, it can decrease the inconsistency between risk propensity and risk behavior. Second, it can encourage risk-taking behavior. The results also show that the heterogeneity in the risk sensitivity of households leads to different outcomes. Namely, financial literacy increases the inconsistency for the risk-averse and decreases it for the risk-seeking by increasing risk-taking behavior.

TI  - Business experience or Financial Literacy? Which one is better for opportunity recognition and superior performance?
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Recognition of useful opportunities is very crucial for small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs') survival and growth in the competitive environment. However, the majority of SMEs cannot easily recognize new opportunities in the turbulent markets due to a lack of managerial competencies and knowledge. Several studies have been carried out to unleash the determinants of opportunity recognition that configure SMEs' success, but the results are disjointed. In particular, the mediating role of opportunity recognition between business experience, financial literacy, and SME performance has been missed. This study aims to test if either financially literate or experienced managers can recognize new opportunities that result in high performance. For testing the hypotheses, we surveyed 232 Pakistani SMEs from the manufacturing, trading, and service sectors. After performing the structural equation modeling, we found that financial literacy and business experience are the substantial prognosticators of opportunity recognition and SMEs' performance. Opportunity recognition shows a partial mediating role between financial literacy and SMEs performance as well as between business experience and SMEs performance. However, this research endorses that business experience is more vital for high performance as compared to financial literacy whereas in terms of opportunity recognition financial literacy is more crucial as compared to experience. This study recommends the enterprises to hire the financially literate and experienced managers as both display a prominent role in the identification of opportunities and high performance. Further implications are discussed.

TI  - Undergraduate student financial education interventions: Medium term evidence of retention, decay, and confidence in financial literacy
T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - University is a significant transition period for young adults as they seek and gain independence, including financial independence. This would appear an ideal teachable moment for delivering financial education, though evidence of financial education intervention outcomes is mixed. We report medium-term empirical evidence, three years after the completion of an undergraduate personal finance semester-length unit, evidence notably absent in the literature. We find students retain significant objective and subjective financial literacy effects, with modest decay, three years after completing a unit of personal finance education. Effects on behavior and behavior intentions are less robust over time as boosts reported immediately after completion dissipate three years hence, though in absolute terms positive behaviors remain high. We found little evidence to link completion of a unit of study with overconfidence, as has previously been suggested, and students overall appear more discerning in their search for financial information sources after the unit.

TI  - Effect of Financial Literacy on Poverty Reduction Across Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda
T2  - GLOBAL SOCIAL WELFARE
AB  - Financial literacy can be critical to reducing poverty, but limited evidence exists on the mechanisms of change. Guided by the financial capability framework, this study examines the direct effects of financial literacy on poverty and the indirect effect through financial inclusion and entrepreneurship, using data from wave 5 of the InterMedia Financial Inclusion Insights Program for Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. We also examined how the relationships differ by gender and locality. Overall, the endogeneity-corrected results suggest that an increase in financial literacy is associated with a 6.9% decrease in poverty. We found that entrepreneurship and financial inclusion act as mechanisms of change through which financial literacy decreases poverty, with the findings differing by gender and locality. These findings point to the poverty-reducing effect of financial literacy, mainly in Tanzania, followed by Kenya and Uganda. The results contribute to understanding how financial literacy and poverty interact and can inform contextually relevant interventions and policies.

TI  - Financial Regulations, Financial Literacy, and Financial Inclusion: Insights from Kenya
T2  - EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
CP  - International Conference on Industrial Economics System and Industrial Security Engineering (IEIS)
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between financial regulation and financial inclusion in Kenya. Employing Probit regression on cross-sectional household level survey data and fixed effect regression on banks panel data, we find that: (i) agency banking regulations and financial literacy could improve formal financial access, and (ii) know-your-customers rules and capital and liquidity macro-prudential regulations could harm financial inclusion. Results are robust to alternative specifications. Given our findings, Kenya should boost financial literacy efforts, relax customer identification requirements in specific instances where they may jeopardize financial inclusion efforts, and stabilize macroeconomic environment to mitigate unintended adverse effects of macro-prudential regulations.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY AS THE BASIS OF THE CULTURE OF UKRAINE'S POPULATION
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - It has been noted that the modern development of the financial sphere of Ukraine is one of the priorities of the state administration agencies. Economic awareness of the population leads to a decrease in unemployment, stability of the national currency and the formation of a new economic culture of the population, which requires, above all, an adequate level of the financial literacy.
   It has been concluded that the functioning of all spheres of society is not possible without the use of the financial information, application of financial knowledge. Financial awareness helps to understand key financial concepts and use them to make decisions about income, expenses and savings, to choose the proper financial instruments, to plan the budget, to accumulate funds for future goals.
   Existing scientific approaches have been studied and the authors have offered own definition of the concept of "financial literacy", which means awareness, knowledge, skills, attitudes ( life guides) and behavior, which allow to make sound financial decisions for achieving personal financial well-being, as well as financial activity of every citizen of the state to ensure social stability in society.
   The authors have distinguished a number of factors that affect the financial literacy of the population and they include: ignorance in the financial sphere; ignorance of how financial institutions of the state operate and their advantages; distrust to financial institutions and financial organizations; inability to distribute income and expenses; fear of starting own business.
   It has been noted that increasing the level of the financial literacy of Ukrainian citizens will enhance their ability to exercise effective financial control over the use of their own financial resources and to make sound financial decisions, and in our opinion, would become an integral element of the financial culture of society.
   It has been substantiated that there is no agency in Ukraine responsible for the implementation of the state policy in the field of the financial literacy of the population, which would develop, implement the National Program for raising the level of financial literacy of the population, and would also monitor the situation on this issue in Ukraine. Perspective research areas are the study of the effectiveness of teaching the discipline "Financial Literacy" in general secondary schools.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Financial Advice, and Stock Market Participation: Evidence From Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - The study examined the influence of financial literacy and financial advice on individuals 'stock market participation in Malaysia. Using survey data from 216 individuals aged 18 years old and above, this study revealed that both financial literacy and financial advice were positively associated with the likelihood of participating in the stock market. Individuals with higher financial literacy, especially advanced financial literacy, were more likely to participate in the stock market. Those who sought advice from financial advisors were also more likely to invest in the stock market. The findings underscore intervention opportunities for regulators, educators and financial advisors in promoting stock market participation in emerging countries.

TI  - Financial Literacy in the Age of Green Investment*
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCE
AB  - We survey a large sample of Swedish households and connect the responses to administrative data to relate pro-environmental attitudes and values to actual investment decisions. Pro-environment households are not more likely to hold pro-environment portfolios. This results from financial disengagement: they are less likely to own stocks, check pension balances, or make green active retirement planning choices. Green financial engagement is stronger in settings where financial literacy is higher or where informational hurdles are lower. Informational barriers appear to prevent financial market prices and returns from fully reflecting household environmental preferences.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF AGEING
AB  - We investigate how financial literacy shapes older Americans' demand for financial advice. Using an experimental module fielded in the Health and Retirement Study, we show that financial literacy strongly improves the quality but not the quantity of financial advice sought. In particular, more financially literate people seek financial help from professionals. This effect is more pronounced among older people and those with more wealth and more complex financial positions. Our analysis result implies that financial literacy and financial advisory services are complementary with, rather than substitutes for, each other.

Following an increase in unexpected shocks, such as COVID-19 and geopolitical conflicts, a high level of BI risk is expected to persist, especially among small firms, which play a key role in the Italian economy. Using a Bank of Italy 2021 survey of 1998 non-financial firms with fewer than 10 employees, we show a significant positive association between the level of the entrepreneur's financial literacy and the purchase of BI insurance. Our results highlight the key role of financial literacy in shaping risk management strategies and are robust to different model specifications, also addressing endogeneity concerns.

TI  - Financial literacy and its influence on internet banking behavior
T2  - EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - This paper presents the survey results for financial literacy among Cypriot adults and reports their financial aptitude and behaviour. Additionally, it investigates for the first time the implications of financial literacy on respondents' usage of digital financial services, particularly internet banking (i-banking). The focus is on Cyprus, a country that experienced an unprecedented financial crisis in 2013 that resulted in a bail-in and an enormous subsequent shrinkage of the banking sector. Cypriot con-sumers face an ever-increasing need for financial sophistication to effectively utilise and manage digital banking services. Neverthless, financial literacy is still low in Cyprus, whereby only 37.33% of survey respondents showed proficiency in financial knowledge. The findings indicate that there is a statistically positive relationship between the levels of financial knowledge and the frequency of i-banking use. More importantly, financially illiterate consumers appear to report far more often than their financially literate peers the lack of trust in i-banking, as well as a lack of self-confidence in financial and digital skills as the main reasons for not using this service. The findings highlight the interplay between financial literacy and digital proficiency, and their implication on individuals' use of i-banking services. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intensifying financial inclusion through the provision of financial literacy training: a gendered perspective
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - This study examines the impact of financial literacy training on financial inclusion and its intensity using data collected from a randomised control trial. An additive index of financial inclusion is generated from four financial inclusion indicators. After testing for baseline balance and estimating impact, our findings show that beneficiaries of financial literacy training are about 7.2 percentage points more likely to own an account while they are 8.2 percentage points more likely to save. Overall, beneficiaries of financial literacy training had a 9.5 percentage points advantage in receiving financial assistance than their non-beneficiary counterparts. While financial literacy training only showed a significant impact on account ownership for female-beneficiary households, male-beneficiary households also only experienced an impact in their savings behaviour and receipt of financial assistance. Moreover, beneficiaries of financial literacy training are more likely to intensify their financial inclusion and the intensity of inclusion is higher for male and young beneficiary households. The results highlight the need to strengthen financial literacy training in order to close the gender financial inclusion gap.

TI  - The Case for the Need for Personal Financial Literacy Education in Botswana Secondary Schools
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - Personal financial literacy (PFL) is an imperative life skill that all 21 st-century students should have. Research shows that the levels of financial literacy in both developing and developed countries are very low across people of all ages. This deplorable state of affairs has negative implications on the well-being of the populace, as evidenced by increased indebtedness, lower saving, poor planning for retirement, and the making of many poor personal financial decisions. Recognizing the potential benefits of financial literacy at both individual and national levels, many countries have started to offer financial education in their schools. This article analyzed the business subjects' curriculum at secondary school level in Botswana and literature published on the subject of PFL, and found that there exists a gap in this area and a need to offer PFL to all learners in the school system. Despite the need for such a move, Botswana does not have a deliberate program in its curriculum that specifically addresses this problem. This article discusses the benefits of personal financial education, the inadequacy of current business subjects to meet this need, and concludes by recommending a mandatory PFL subject in the Botswana secondary school curriculum.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Intra-household Decision Making: Evidence from Rwanda
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - Research has consistently shown that women's involvement in household decision making positively affects household outcomes such as nutrition and education of children. Is financial literacy a determinant for women to participate in intrahousehold decision making? Using data on savings groups in Rwanda, we examine this relationship and show that women with higher financial literacy are more involved in financial and expenditure decisions. Instrumental variable estimations suggest a causal link. For this reason, we perform a decomposition analysis breaking down the gender gap in financial literacy into differences based on observed socio-demographic and psychological characteristics and differences in returns on these characteristics. Our results show high explanatory power by education, happiness, symptoms of depression and openness but also suggest that a substantial fraction can be explained by differences in returns. We argue that this results from a strong role of society and culture.

A survey of 516 UK women and men of prestate retirement age was used to establish interrelationships between gender, retirement planning, and financial literacy, taking account of attitudinal and expectational variables. Findings confirm lower levels of planning among women, but contrary to previous studies, this study reveals that financial literacy is not significantly related to planning. Furthermore, when attitudinal and expectational variables are incorporated as independent variables, gender becomes statistically insignificant as a determinant of planning.

TI  - Financial literacy and advice perceptions among UK higher education students: an ethnicity tale?
T2  - REVIEW OF ECONOMICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD
AB  - Although considerable efforts have been made in many countries to raise the financial literacy of those from disadvantaged backgrounds, it is unclear whether these are having an effect. This is particularly the case for those of ethnic minority background, who may suffer from other disadvantages. This study examines the financial literacy of students from two universities in the East Midlands region of the UK. It considers the role played by ethnic background. It is found that significant differences in financial literacy remain between the White majority and particular ethnic groups. In part, this appears to reflect their perceptions of the types of decision they see financial literacy relating to. Some ethnic groups saw financial literacy as being of more relevance for larger, less frequent financial decisions, but saw less connection, and relevance, to the day to day choices they had to make. Ethnicity also potentially has an indirect effect, as informal sources of advice, and those that promote a financial market perspective, tend to be valued more highly. The implications are worrying given that the respondents are the more highly educated independent young members of the population. Current attempts to assist the development of financial literacy therefore appear to be failing those from some ethnic minority groups. This will leave them at a continuing disadvantage, unless interventions can highlight the day to day importance and value of financial literacy.

TI  - The Influence of Financial Literacy on Retirement Planning in South Africa
T2  - SOUTHERN AFRICAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Background: A shift in the retirement planning and pensions landscape has created an enormous responsibility for individuals to plan for their retirement provision actively. Very few South Africans reach the average retirement age of 65 years with sufficient funds to sustain themselves during their retirement.
   Purpose/objective: Using secondary data from the 2011 South African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS), this study aims to examine the influence financial literacy has on the retirement planning of South Africans. The secondary aim of the study was to investigate the financial literacy and retirement planning behaviour of certain demographic groups: gender, age, race, education, and income levels.
   Design/methodology: Binomial logistic regression is used to establish if financial literacy influences planning for retirement.
   Findings: The results show that financial literacy significantly influences retirement planning. Furthermore, only 24% of South Africans actively plan for retirement and financial literacy was particularly low among women, less educated individuals and Black African people.
   Research limitations: Firstly, the study relies on self-reported measures. Secondly, the binomial logistic regression analysis only indicates the likelihood of an individual planning for retirement based on their financial literacy score.
   Originality/value: This study contributes to retirement planning literature as it is one of the few studies that explore retirement planning and financial literacy in the context of a developing country using a geographic, nationally representative sample.

AB  - PurposePresent study investigated the influence of female descendent entrepreneur's self-compassion on the perceived succession success of small-family businesses (S-FB) with the mediating mechanism of financial literacy.Design/methodology/approachThe primary data was collected from 319 female descendent entrepreneurs who were designated as chairwomen, and managing director positions in their retails sector S-FBs. The purposive sampling technique was used to collect the data. The provided hypotheses are tested using the partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. This study followed multiple regression analyses to see the influence of self-compassion (mindfulness, self-isolation, self-judgment and over-identification) on financial literacy and perceived succession success.FindingsThe results reveal that female descendent entrepreneurs mindfulness and over-identification significantly increase but self-isolation decreases the likelihood of successful succession transition. Moreover, female descendent entrepreneur's financial literacy increases mindfulness and overidentification while it decreases self-isolation and improves the likelihood of succession success. However, financial literacy does not influence self-judgmental traits and perceived succession success.Practical implicationsThis study highlights a vital issue, how the financial literacy of female descendent entrepreneurs manages their self-compassion and increases the likelihood of succession success. In addition, it covers a research gap and helps the S-FBs to improve their survival rate by focusing on the descendent entrepreneur's self-compassion and financial literacy.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the body of knowledge by emphasizing predictors that influence the successful succession transition to subsequent generations. This study determines the influence of self-compassion of female descendent entrepreneurs on perceived succession success and financial literacy as a mediator by using the self-control theory. The study can be useful to family business consultants, policymakers and family businesses.

TI  - Understanding the gender gap in financial literacy: The role of culture
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Using data from the 2015 China Household Financial Survey (CHFS) this paper examines the effect of culture on the gender gap in financial literacy. We exploit geographical differences in culture in China, comparing outcomes between rural and urban areas and between areas in the east and west (Shanghai and Chongqing). Using the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition we show that, nationally, the gender gap in financial literacy is entirely the product of differences in the way men and women acquire financial literacy. It is a result consistent with cultural effects. When considering just women in Shanghai and Chongqing we observe a raw financial literacy differential of 13% (favoring Shanghai). This gap is also the product of differences in the way financial literacy is acquired. It provides additional evidence as to the importance of culture when it comes to understanding financial literacy.

TI  - Financial literacy, financial inclusion and participation of individual on the Ghana stock market
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This paper examines the impact of financial literacy and financial inclusion on stock market participation in Ghana. It employs a sample of 1,966 respondents across the 10 regions of Ghana for the year 2018. We employ biprobit models to estimate the influence of financial literacy on financial inclusion, while robust probit models are used to independently analyse the effect of financial literacy and financial inclusion on stock market participation as well as their joint effect. We find the following results: first, financial literacy positively influences financial inclusion. Second, the study does not support previous findings that financial literacy is not a determinant of stock market participation in Ghana. Third, financial inclusion through using an account to save significantly affects stock market participation. Finally, the interaction of financial literacy and financial inclusion on stock market participation provides evidence of no significant effect.

TI  - Extending financial literacy to insurance literacy: a survey approach
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - We extend behavioural research in investment and retirement savings to insurance, by investigating factors that may influence individuals' insurance decision making. These factors include financial literacy, specialist insurance education and some behavioural biases. Based on a definition of insurance literacy that requires both having, and applying insurance knowledge, we find from a survey of postgraduate students that financial literacy does not necessarily translate to insurance literacy, whereas more specialised education can improve insurance literacy. Results also indicate specialist education potentially reduces susceptibility to anchoring effects.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY IN SOUTH AFRICAN HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS: AN UNMET NEED IN HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - The holistic training of healthcare professionals as a strategy to build the healthcare system has received considerable attention. As part of training a holistic workforce, it is expected the healthcare professionals be component in management and governance. Financial literacy is low globally and impacts financial decision-making and business management. Despite high levels of education, medical professionals elsewhere in the world have low financial literacy. Financial literacy levels in South African healthcare professionals are unknown. This study investigated the degree of and contributors to financial literacy in South African healthcare professionals. A validated financial literacy questionnaire was completed by 473 healthcare professionals, of whom 130 owned private practices. Financial literacy scores were determined as a composite score based on financial knowledge, financial behaviour and financial attitudes. The independent contribution of demographic factors to financial literacy were determined in multivariate linear regression analysis. Financial literacy in healthcare professionals was relatively high (73%). Of the total cohort 24%, 27% and 63% did not reach acceptable scores for financial knowledge, behaviour, and attitudes, respectively. Sex, medical specialty and being in private healthcare predicted financial knowledge scores. Higher income and self-rated financial knowledge were associated with financial literacy. In business owners, business-specific financial literacy was low (51%), and not associated with general financial literacy (r=-0.11, p=0.40). Education in economics and finance predicted business-related financial literacy scores (p=0.02). Financial attitudes that favour the short term may impact financial decision-making in healthcare professionals in managing small businesses and state healthcare facilities. Current approaches in health professions education may impact the success of the healthcare system in South Africa.

TI  - Sustainability Literacy and Financial Literacy of Young People in the Baltic States
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The stream of scientific articles on sustainability, financial literacy, and sustainability literacy shows their importance in the transformation process. New financial instruments with sustainable or green features have been introduced in the financial market. As a result, financial literacy is becoming more complex and the need for sustainability literacy is also increasing. Financial literacy now includes not only the knowledges, attitudes, and behavior of financial well-being but also positive impacts on environmental and social development. This article presupposes financial literacy and sustainability literacy are key instruments for the sustainable development of society. The aim of this article is to analyze the scientific literature on sustainability literacy and financial literacy and investigate the level of sustainability literacy and financial literacy among young people aged 15-30 years in the Baltic states. A systematic review of the literature was carried out followed by a survey, which revealed some differences between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania in terms of sustainability and financial literacy levels.

TI  - Does Financial Literacy Affect Household Financial Behavior? The Role of Limited Attention
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Financial literacy is essential for every individual concerned with public welfare and household portfolio choices. In this study, we investigate the impact of household financial literacy on individuals' financial behavior using the China Household Financial Survey Data (CHFS) of 2015 and 2017. The results show that financial knowledge has significant current, long-term, and dynamic effects on financial behavior. This finding suggests that financial literacy is an important factor in shaping and improving financial behavior. Second, financial literacy can improve residents' limited attention, and residents with high attention tend to have formal bank accounts, participate in the stock market, and engage in financial behaviors in situations such as risky financial markets. High attention also helps to improve residents' financial behavior. This relationship suggests that financial literacy positively impacts formal bank account holding, participation in financial markets, participation in commercial insurance, participation in pension plans, and credit card holdings through limited attention channels that facilitate access to specific financial information. In addition, heterogeneity analysis showed that the impact of financial literacy on financial behavior differs significantly between urban and rural households, between men and women, and between high and low education levels. The study provides valuable insights for policy implications to enhance financial literacy, such as carrying out financial training to improve residents' knowledge about financial aspects, which further helps to optimize household financial decision-making.

TI  - The roles of financial literacy and overconfidence in investment decisions in Saudi Arabia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Financial literacy has gained much attention amongst scholars, policymakers and other stakeholders due to its role in backing up investment decisions, improving personal financial management and increasing financial wellbeing. This study examines the influence of financial literacy on investment decisions with the moderating effect of the overconfidence behavioural bias. Data were collected from 180 respondents in Saudi Arabia using a questionnaire, and a convenience sampling technique was applied. The study's findings were analysed using the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) technique. It was found that financial literacy positively and significantly influenced investment decisions. Moreover, the results show that overconfidence positively affected investment decisions and that the relationship between financial literacy and investment decisions was positively and significantly moderated by overconfidence.

TI  - Parental influence, financial literacy and investment behaviour of young adults
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose Parents are the first and leading socialization agents for young adults. It is vital to recognize the influence of perceived parental financial behaviour in shaping the financial literacy and investment behaviour of their children. In this context, this paper aims to test the perceived parental influence on financial literacy. Additionally, the direct and indirect influence of financial literacy on investment behaviour of young adults is examined. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses survey-based cross-sectional data. The partial least squares-structure equation model has been used to estimate and test the hypothesized relationships. Findings Perceived parental financial behaviour has been found to significantly impact the level of financial literacy. In turn, financial literacy positively influences the investment behaviour of young adults. Moreover, the young adults' perception of confidence over ability to take right financial decisions drives their decision to invest. Social implications The results of this study imply that there is a need to have planned interventions from policymakers to ensure that young adults are financially literate. This may require introduction of planned programmes or workshops at middle or senior school levels. These programmes should help young adults understand the need for focused and long-term investing in the absence of social benefits. Originality/value This study is one of the preliminary works to examine the perceived parental influence on young adults' financial literacy and further linking these with actual investment behaviour.

TI  - Financial literacy and self employment-The moderating effect of gender and race
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Within the next decade, the number of self-employed workers, now 40% of the workforce, is predicted to surpass that of traditional employees. Managing finances (financial literacy) is an important skill set for self-employment. We bring attention to the growing prevalence of self-employment at a time when financial literacy is in decline in the United States. Using a sample of 15,069 participants in the 2015 and 2018 National Financial Capability Study, we find support for a positive association between financial literacy and self-employment in a U.S. context and extend prior research by focusing on two widely studied and important U.S. demographic segments in selfemployment and entrepreneurship literature - gender and race. Contrary to other U.S.-based studies, we find that women with higher financial literacy scores are more likely to be self-employed than men; yet surprisingly, there is no significant difference in the association between higher financial literacy scores and self-employment between non-white and white U.S. respondents. We discuss the implications of the findings for researchers, policymakers, educators, and those considering self-employment.

TI  - Financial inclusion - does digital financial literacy matter for women entrepreneurs?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose - Women's financial inclusion has become a global research agenda, and past studies provide mixed evidence on the determinants of financial inclusion among women entrepreneurs across the globe. However, the impact of digital financial literacy on women's financial inclusion has seldom been addressed in the past literature.Design/methodology/approach - The authors perform a cross-sectional analysis of 144 countries using the World Bank Global Findex Database.Findings - This study's probabilistic regression results indicate that women entrepreneurs with a higher degree of digital financial literacy are more likely to engage in formal banking channels.Practical implications - The study findings have practical implications in terms of allowing regulators and banks to draw effective policies to attract women customers. Lack of effective regulatory intervention could lead to women exploring financial crimes, such as money laundering, due to their lack of involvement with the formal banking channel.Originality/value - The authors explore the impact of digital financial literacy on women's financial inclusion. Such evidence is rare in the existing literature.

TI  - Does financial literacy mitigate gender differences in investment behavioral bias?
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - This study investigates gender differences in a number of behavioral biases using an online survey of individual investors aged eighteen and over, each of whom has at least one year of stock trading experience in Taiwan. The results reveal that women are significantly more regret averse than men, whereas men have significantly stronger self-attribution, illusion of control, and confirmation biases than women. However, among those who have a high level of financial literacy, the prevalence of behavioral biases is similar across both genders. This suggests that financial literacy mitigates gender differences in behavioral bias.

TI  - Role of financial literacy in investment choices of financial consumers: an insight from India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose - The study aims to address two objectives. First, to examine the socioeconomic and demographic factors contributing to financial literacy and second, to analyze if financial literacy affects investment choices.Design/methodology/approach - The study uses financial inclusion insights (FII) survey data conducted by Intermedia, comprising 47,132 individuals in India. Further, instrument variable estimation has been used to analyze the relationship between financial literacy and individuals' investment choices.Findings- The study finds that differences in financial literacy level can be attributed to various socioeconomic/demographic factors like age, gender, education levels, income, location of residence, sources of information, etc. Econometric analyses indicate that financial literacy influences investment decisions, mainly in businesses and traditional assets such as gold, property, etc.Originality/value - The study contributes to the growing literature on financial literacy in the context of developing countries like India and highlights the role of financial literacy in how individuals make investment choices. Using a novel instrument, i.e. participation in the stock market by family or peers for advanced financial literacy, the results provide evidence that advanced financial literacy among individuals increases the probability of their stock market participation.

TI  - Financial literacy among university students: A study in eight European countries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - This study analysed the level of financial literacy among university students in Estonia, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation and Turkey. The purpose of the study was to determine the level of financial literacy among university students, and to find out the relationship between financial knowledge and demographic characteristics of students. Online survey instrument was used to collect data. 409 fully completed questionnaires were accepted for analysis. Logistic regression was used to analyse of impact of the demographic characteristics on financial literacy. Overall mean of correct answers for the survey was 72.2%. This result represents a medium level of financial literacy about personal finance. Results indicate that male students, business major students, PhD students, those who live in a rental house, those whose parents have high level income, those who get advice on financial matters from their friends, those who took financial course before, those who get financial information about financial issues from university education, and students from Poland are more knowledgeable on personal finance. More financial courses should be provided in university education programmes, which could help more students handle their finances better and improve their financial wellbeing. It should be taken into consideration that in recent years, environmental and technological influences on financial literacy may be more important than parental influence.

TI  - Does financial literacy "grease the wheels" of the loans market? A note
T2  - STUDIES IN ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB  - Purpose What is the impact of financial literacy on the lending activity of banks? Based on the results of the S&P Global FinLit Survey for an extensive sample of countries, this paper aims to provide the first global test for the impact of country-level financial literacy on the lending activity of commercial banks. Design/methodology/approach The authors use data on financial literacy by country from the S&P Global FinLit Survey that was completed in 2014 and lending activity and macroeconomic control variables data from the World Bank from 2015 to 2017 to estimate the cross-sectional effect of financial literacy on the importance of loans and of non-performing loans, using different estimation methods. Findings The results show that, first, financial literacy favors lending activity, contributing to enhance the importance of credit in the economy. Second, financial literacy prevents bad loans from building up, thus reducing credit risk and favoring the quality of the credit portfolio of banks. These results are robust to several controls for macroeconomic conditions and the quality of institutions. They are also robust to different estimation methods. Research limitations/implications The evidence of the positive (negative) impact of population financial literacy on the quantity (poor quality) of loans suggests that the efforts to enhance the financial literacy of the population contribute to the sustainable development of the financial sector and economic growth. Originality/value The paper extends to an international and country-level the available evidence of the consequences of the existence (or lack of) of financial literacy for the lending activity of commercial banks, focusing on the amount of credit granted and the quality of such credit. Thus, the paper provides an exploratory analysis of the impact of country-level financial literacy on the lending activities of commercial banks.

TI  - Exploring financial literacy education strategies based on small- and micro-enterprise business practices
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose: This study explored the nature of business practices of small-and micro-enterprises within the South African context to propose recommendations for financial literacy education strategies. Design/methodology/approach: The data collection technique used for this qualitative study included semi-structured in-depth interviews with a case study of 10 small-and micro-enterprise owners who collectively trade within five of the nine South African provinces. Findings/results: Small-and micro-enterprises do not need to differ significantly because the respective business practice themes identified are relevant within both contexts. Both category enterprises make use of a cash basis system, generally have inventory management systems in place and do not have sophisticated financial planning practices. The micro-enterprises studied do not have business plans or accurate pricing strategies and cash management is a concern. The small-enterprise participants generally did not show interest in competitors and their enterprises had more sophisticated bookkeeping practices in place than micro-enterprises. Practical implications: Financial literacy education strategies for the owners should focus on providing guidance on tax matters, significance of business plans and how to prepare them, debtors management strategies, inventory management strategies, and a basic bookkeeping system that evolves from the cash basis of accounting to the accrual basis of accounting. should also aim to educate owners on the importance of financial planning and risk management. Originality/value: This research provides an evidence-based description of the characteristics of South African small-and micro-enterprises, which could prove valuable in developing future owner financial literacy education programmes as well as other support strategies targeted at this audience.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - In this paper, we examine the impact of financial experience on financial literacy. Exploiting a unique feature of New Zealand, whereby domestic students can obtain interest-free student loans and can fully participate in the national retirement scheme while international students cannot, we employ an instrumental variables approach to identify the causal effect of financial experience on financial literacy. We conduct surveys on a sample of 338 business students and find that there is a positive and causal effect of financial experience on financial literacy. Our results have important implications for financial education programmes and may explain why many of these programmes to date have had limited success.

TI  - Moderating effect of financial literacy on the relationship between socioeconomic status and depression
T2  - JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH
AB  - This study examined the moderating effect of financial literacy on the relationship between socioeconomic status and depression. A questionnaire survey of 2173 employees using multiple regression and simple slope analyses showed that the relationship between socioeconomic status and depression was weaker among Japanese employees with high financial literacy than among those with low financial literacy. Interpretation from a financial capability framework perspective, including a sense of control and the potential for prevention and intervention of socioeconomic status-related depression through educational interventions related to financial literacy, was discussed.

TI  - Cognitive functioning, financial literacy, and judgment in older age
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - We investigate the relationships between financial literacy, financial judgment, and cognitive ability at older ages. We find people who actively manage their own retirement savings portfolios display greater levels of financial literacy and judgment than those who do not. We identify the different cognitive processes underlying financial judgment and decision-making tasks versus those underlying learned concepts such as basic financial literacy. Although these decline at different rates the latter may potentially compensate for, and mask declines, in the former. We find an overall low propensity to seek financial advice which has no significant relationship with cognitive functioning. Our findings underscore the importance of monitoring cognitive ability in older ages.

TI  - Entrepreneurial spirits in women and men. The role of financial literacy and digital skills
T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the attitudes to entrepreneurship of Italian households, focusing on the importance of financial literacy and digital skills as potentially relevant factors shaping entrepreneurship. We put the gender focus to our analysis to detect whether, and to what extent, women and men differ in their propensity to run a business. We carry out our research by using the Bank of Italy SHIW dataset for the years 2008 and 2010. Our findings suggest a strong heterogeneity between men and women in the role played by financial literacy and digital skills. Results show a positive and significant correlation between financial literacy and the probability of being an entrepreneur but only for men. We also find that digitally skilled male respondents are much more likely to be entrepreneurs.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Gender Differences: Women Choose People While Men Choose Things?
T2  - ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - According to gender personality traits, women are more interested in people, whereas men are more interested in things. The goal of this research is to see if there is a gender gap in financial literacy and if these disparities can be explained by different areas of interest. A convenience sample of nearly a thousand responses was received in quantitative research. The findings clearly show that women have lower financial literacy than men, but there is no indication that this is due to men and women's differing interests in people and things.

TI  - Designing mathematical tasks to enhance financial literacy among children in Grades 1-8
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - One approach to incorporating financial literacy into educational curricula is the integration of it into closely related courses such as mathematics. Research on curriculum development that fosters the integration of mathematics and financial literacy is necessary. This study aims to develop mathematical tasks that are embedded with financial literacy concepts to be integrated into mathematics courses. The tasks were designed for children in Grades 1 through 8. They were shaped by considering mathematical education standards, concepts, subjects and objectives. The tasks also addressed related societal issues including fair wages and working conditions. The dynamics that shape the design of the tasks include the interrelationship between mathematics education and financial literacy, children's (as the target age group) financial understanding and task design parameters. Each task, on the one hand, contains the first page geared toward students; on the other, it presents the implementation steps, teaching guidelines, cautions and limitations for teachers as well as background served as the inspiration for the task design. It is expected that the tasks will contribute to the development of students from an early age in financial literacy education as well as be beneficial for relevant experimental studies.

TI  - Impact of inflated perceptions of financial literacy on financial decision making
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - We examine whether inflated perceptions of financial literacy affect financial decision making. Gaps between objective financial literacy and self-reported (perceived) financial literacy (blind spots) predict 19 financial behaviors better than age, gender, income, ethnicity, marital status, self-employment status, and general education levels. Only two predictors, perceived financial literacy and financial education, carried similar levels of predictive power on financial behaviors. Those with inflated perceptions of financial literacy are more likely to miss mortgage payments, receive a collection call, use informal debt, and have poor banking behavior. Those without blind spots make better financial decisions. The differences between those with and without blind spots are more pronounced among individuals with higher education and income.

TI  - Financial literacy induced financial well-being in Ghana: Does financial inclusion mediate?
T2  - THUNDERBIRD INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - We investigated the mediating role of financial inclusion in the relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being in Ghana. Using PLS-SEM, we found that financial inclusion indeed mediates financial literacy and financial well-being in Ghana. We also documented a positive and significant relationship between Ghanaians' financial literacy and financial well-being. Again, financial literacy has a direct positive effect on financial inclusion. Hence, to enhance the impact of financial literacy on financial well-being in Ghana, policymakers should grant financial institutions enough freedom to offer a variety of financial services; financial institutions that have lost credibility in Ghana (such as insurance companies) should be put in check to build the trust of Ghanaians in them; and the cost of using a mobile phone and internet services to access financial services in Ghana should be reduced. The management of financial institutions can utilize the freedom offered to them by policymakers to offer various financial services to the public, build trust in customers, and offer lower-cost services to help improve the financial well-being of Ghanaians.

TI  - THE SYSTEM OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SUSTAINABLE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND CORPORATE FINANCIAL LITERACY
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - The main objective of this research project is to create new model in the field of corporate financial literacy, with a special emphasis on the Hungarian SME sector. In our study we explore the interpretations and dimensions of corporate finance. Beyond the theoretical analysis, the study aims to justify the level and direction of the relationship between corporate financial literacy and corporate financial results, the efficiency of operations, the outcome of corporate financial decisions. It has been taken a 511-element representative sample from the Hungarian SME sector and built a linear regression model to find a significant moderation effect of financial literacy between financial performance and results. The method used in this study is a literature review analysis of manuscripts discussing topics related to financial literacy, corporate sustainability, published in the last 10 years. Our results show that there are positive and significant relationships between company management and corporate financial literacy. It has been also established in our analysis that the level of corporate financial literacy influences financial results and the effectiveness of operations in companies. This paper draws the attention of business leaders to the importance of financial awareness to help stakeholders and companies to provide better solutions to the existing environmental and economic challenges. The study offers useful policy input for corporate and economic policy decision-makers, which could also help improve the competitiveness of national economies.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Savings Culture and Millennials Students Behavior Towards Retirement
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The objective of this work is to know, based on gender, the level of financial literacy of millennials students in the city of Veracruz; whether they have a savings culture and their behavior regarding retirement savings. For this, the descriptive cross-sectioned method was used, with a sample of 120 millennials students from Veracruz between 17 and 40 years of age. The data was obtained from an electronic survey applied through WhatsApp and Facebook. The instrument used was designed with items taken from surveys by Lusardi and Mitchell (2014), CONSAR+ (2017), Banamex (2014) and Banamex-UNAM (2008). Subsequently, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to test the reliability of the instrument. The main findings are that this group has basic financial knowledge, however, not enough to handle more complex financial products such as bonds. In terms of gender, it is men who have a higher level of financial literacy, while it is women who have a greater culture of saving and are more aware of the importance of saving for retirement.

T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Most existing studies on the regional distribution of financial literacy overlook the cross-regional variation over time and its determinants. Therefore, this paper chooses spatial Durbin model with panel data to account for spatial dependence of financial literacy across US in 2009, 2012 and 2015. Our empirical findings support that financial literacy of an individual state is associated with the characteristics of its neighbors. Specifically, we find support for the spatial spillover perspective in which per capita real GDP and unemployment rate are positively, and Gini coefficient is negatively associated with the financial literacy in neighboring states.

TI  - Effect of household's financial literacy on pension decision making: evidence from China's new rural pension program
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose China's New Rural Pension Program (NRPP) has been implemented for a decade, but the factors that facilitate rural residents' participation have received little attention. This study aims to investigate whether financial literacy has an influence on rural residents' behavior of participation in the NRPP. In particular, this study further verifies if high financial literacy is important and whether financial education can enhance the impact of financial literacy on current, long-term and dynamic pension decisions of rural households. Design/methodology/approach This study investigates the impact of financial literacy on rural residents' participation in China's NRPP using the China Household Financial Survey (CHFS) Data of 2015 and 2017. This study constructs an analytical framework for current, long-term and dynamic impacts and comprehensively analyzes the value of financial literacy in the decision making of the NRPP. This study uses the instrumental variable method to solve the possible endogeneity problem. In addition, the authors also demonstrate the positive role of high financial literacy in household pension decisions. Further analysis reveals gender and regional heterogeneity in the impact of financial literacy on pension decisions. The moderating effect model explores whether financial education has a significant moderating effect on financial literacy and pension decision making of the NRPP. Findings Financial literacy can improve the participation behavior of households in rural areas (dynamic effect) and promote their current and long-term participation in the NRPP, choosing a higher pension contribution level in the NRPP. However, financial literacy has no significant effect on the change in the contribution amount of the NRPP. Further research finds that high financial literacy has comparative advantages in household pension decision making in rural areas. There are gender and regional differences in the impact of financial literacy on pension decisions. In addition, effective financial literacy education enhances the current, long-term and dynamic impacts of residents' financial literacy on NRPP participation and pension contributions. Practical implications This study comprehensively considers the impact of financial literacy on pension decision making behavior from three aspects: current, long-term and dynamic, making up for the dearth in the existing literature that only focuses on the impact of financial literacy on current financial behaviors and bridging the gap between the theoretical framework and experimental results. Our study proposes new policy implications: (1) Governments and financial institutions should pay attention to financial literacy and education levels in rural areas and carry out financial education and training programs to increase social welfare levels by increasing rural residents' participation and pension contribution. (2) The community can strengthen the policy advocacy of the NRPP and make people develop a stronger sense of trust toward it. The government can also subsidize individual accounts through financial support. Originality/value This study comprehensively considers the impact of financial literacy on pension decision-making behavior from three aspects: current, long-term and dynamic, making up for the dearth in the existing literature that only focuses on the impact of financial literacy on current financial behaviors and bridging the gap between the theoretical framework and experimental results.

TI  - Financial literacy: Thai middle-class women do not lag behind
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - This research studies the stylized fact of a "gender gap'' in that women tend to have lower financial literacy than men. Our data which samples middle-class people from Bangkok does not show a gender gap for those with at least minimum wage earnings. This result is not explained by men's low financial literacy, nor by women's high income and good education. Rather, country characteristics may influence finance-specific gender equality, such as Thailand's small gender gaps in pupils' mathematics abilities and secondary school enrollment, and women's strong role in financial affairs. This may indicate ways to reduce the gender gap in financial literacy elsewhere. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A comparative analysis of financial literacy levels and initiatives among students in five European countries
T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB  - Given the expected advantages for individuals and societies, financial literacy is high on the policy agenda in many countries. This paper reports the results from a unique survey conducted on a sample of 13-16-year-old students in five European countries, aimed at measuring and comparing their level of financial literacy skills. The results indicate significant differences in the level of financial literacy across countries that are interpreted in the light of the differences in the countries' educational policies and experiences with financial education. The findings suggest that supra-national coordinated action is needed to guarantee better financial knowledge and safeguard economic stability in future crises.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC EDUCATION
AB  - The Test of Financial Literacy (TFL) was created to measure the financial knowledge of high school students. Its content is based on the standards and benchmarks stated in the National Standards for Financial Literacy (Council for Economic Education 2013). The test development process involved extensive item writing and review. Test data collected from 1,218 high schools to evaluate the measure indicate that the overall test is reliable and valid, and test items contribute to the effectiveness of the instrument. Further test analysis was conducted using an item response theory (IRT) model with four parameters to estimate item discrimination, item difficulty, guessing, and inattention. The IRT results indicate that the measure is effective in assessing student financial literacy across a broad range of student abilities.

TI  - The role of financial literacy in households' asset accumulation process: evidence from Ghana
T2  - REVIEW OF ECONOMICS OF THE HOUSEHOLD
AB  - This paper examines the impact of financial literacy training on household asset accumulation using data collected from a randomised controlled trial implemented in Ghana. Financial assets are measured using account holdings and savings while durable assets and their decomposed components are captured using their total values. After testing for baseline balance, impact is estimated using treatment effect models. We find that financial literacy training plays a significant role in accumulation of both financial and durable assets, but the impact is more evident in the accumulation of productive durable assets. Our overall findings on productive and non-productive assets are robust to alternative conceptualisations of what constitutes productive and non-productive assets. Our results also show that financial literacy training has an impact on the accumulation of both total and productive assets in female-beneficiary households, as well as enhancing account holdings for females, although this effect was larger for males. The analyses for different age cohorts also revealed that financial literacy training results in higher asset accumulation among younger household heads.

TI  - KNOWLEDGE CHANGES FATE: CAN FINANCIAL LITERACY ADVANCE POVERTY REDUCTION IN RURAL HOUSEHOLDS?
T2  - SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Poverty reduction and inclusive growth in poor rural areas attracted the increasing attention of governments and scholars around the world. We investigate financial literacy by conceptualizing its impacts on rural households' poverty reduction, considering current and long-term economic income dynamics. Using a database from 2015 to 2017 China Household Finance Survey, we find that financial literacy has current and long-term effects on promoting rural households' status by eliminating and effectively improving poverty (dynamic effects). Second, this study reveals that financial literacy and education have a significant complementary effect on rural households' poverty reduction. The study distinguishes financial literacy from knowledge obtained through general education. Third, financial education is shown to significantly improve rural households' financial literacy on and enhance poverty reduction. The policy implications of our findings include that the governments and financial institutions are also required to rigorously measure, understand and improve financial literacy. Reform of financial regulatory systems must include a national strategy for education projects and improvement in the quality and supervision of financial products and services.

TI  - Financial literacy and financial behaviour: a bibliometric analysis
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose Numerous exploratory, conceptual and empirical enquiries on financial behaviour and literacy have been conducted in the areas of economics, finance, business and management. However, no attempt was made to present a comprehensive science mapping of the area so far. Hence, the study intends to elicit the trend in the research field through synthesis of knowledge structures. Design/methodology/approach Bibliometric analysis in the field of financial literacy and financial behaviour was performed on a sample of 1,138 documents based on a scientific search strategy run on the Web of Science database for the period 1985-2020. Biblioshiny, which is a web-based application included in Bibliometrix package developed in R-language (Ariaa and Cuccurullo, 2017), was used for the study. With the help of automated workflow in the software, prominent journals, authors, countries, articles, themes were identified; and citation, co-citation and social network analysis were conducted. Findings Results show that the themes of financial literacy and financial behaviour have evolved over a period of time as an interdisciplinary field. In the initial stages, researchers focused on demographic and socio-economic determinants, but gradually the field embraced topics like behavioural and psychological constructs influencing financial behaviour. Along with conceptual structure, this research reveals the intellectual and social structure of the domain. This study provides important insights on areas that need further investigation. Research limitations/implications The current research is a bibliometric analysis and hence limitations related to such studies are applicable. For future researchers to derive a strong conceptual framework, a systematic review of literature would be helpful. Science mapping for this study is limited to the Web of Science database owing to its wider coverage of good quality journals, structured formats which are compatible with the Bibliometrix software. Practical implications The current study provides important insights on financial literacy and financial behaviour and their inter-linkages. It highlights the most addressed issues in the area and leads towards the prospective areas for research. It informs the future researchers about the emergent themes, contexts and possibilities of collaborations in this area by revealing social and intellectual structure of the domain. Social implications The paper can provide important insights for policy formulation in the areas of financial education and literacy. Originality/value There has been lot of conceptual and empirical work done in the past, across countries, spanning the disciplines such as economics, finance, psychology and consumer behaviour. A major contribution of this study is that it consolidates fragmented literature in the area, highlights significant sources, authors and documents, while exploring the relation between financial literacy and financial behaviour.

TI  - Financial literacy, role models, and micro-enterprise performance in the informal economy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS JOURNAL-RESEARCHING ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - This article analyses how financial literacy and role models contribute to explaining the performance of micro-enterprises in the informal economy. Grounded in human capital reasoning and social learning theory, we argue that financial literacy and personal knowledge of role models lead to improved firm performance. We test our hypotheses on a unique dataset of 739 micro-enterprises in Ecuador. We find that financial literacy is an important predictor of financial performance but not growth, and the use of role models predicts return on assets but not other performance metrics. Our results have implications for future work on micro-enterprises and the nature of the human and social capital of their founders.

TI  - The interdependence of financial literacy and crypto literacy
T2  - ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - As cryptocurrencies become more prevalent in investor portfolios, we examine whether a greater knowledge of digital assets is connected to an understanding of broader financial concepts. We find a positive relationship between cryptocurrency (crypto) literacy and financial literacy, suggesting that a higher understanding of cryptocurrencies may lead to better financial decision-making. Our research reveals that individuals with higher levels of subjective crypto literacy are more likely to seek professional guidance and view it as complementary to their own knowledge of digital assets. We conclude by discussing the possibility of including crypto literacy in financial services.

TI  - Do Women's Financial Literacy Accelerate Financial Inclusion? Evidence from Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB  - Financial literacy is crucial to financial inclusion and facilitates access to and use of formal financial services and products. This study aims to investigate the role of financial literacy in improving financial inclusion among Pakistan's women (a country characterized by a high gender gap and lower financial inclusion). A positivist philosophy was adopted and a survey design using a self-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data from a sample of working women and university graduates. Initially, a pilot test was conducted on a sample of 80 respondents to confirm the reliability and validity of the questionnaire used. Final sample of 478 respondents was analyzed using inferential descriptive statistics and covariance-based structural equation modeling (CBSEM). The findings demonstrate that different aspects of financial literacy, i.e., savings management practice, debt management practice, investment management practice, and financial planning management practice, have a significant positive impact on financial inclusion among women. The findings are supported by theories of behavioral finance (i.e., self-efficacy and goal setting theory) and institutional theory. The study contributes to the existing literature on the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion and has implications for policymakers and practitioners in the financial sector in Pakistan.

TI  - Improving Financial Literacy Using the Medical Mini-MBA at a Canadian Medical School
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction
   Financial literacy correlates with less debt and better retirement planning. Medical students, residents, and physicians often have poor financial literacy and large amounts of debt. We measured baseline financial literacy and whether it improved with the administration of a financial literacy course.
   Methods
   We created the Medical Mini-MBA, a six-week financial literacy course that targeted gaps in financial literacy among medical students and residents. Weekly topics included personal finance, investing, real estate and mortgage, physician billing and payment models, income and tax, and choosing a medical specialty. A 46-question financial literacy assessment was delivered to participants before and after the course.
   Results
   Of the 276 who participated in the course, 179 (64.86%) participated in the study. Participants who completed the course improved their financial literacy score by 10.10/46.00 +/- 5.12 (n=93, p<0.001). Self assessment of financial literacy was positively correlated with financial literacy exam scores (r=0.366, p<0.001). Demographics such as gender, geography, education level, and first-degree relatives who are/were physicians had no effect on financial literacy scores.
   Conclusions
   The Medical Mini-MBA improved financial literacy at a Canadian medical school. Implementation of the course may equip medical students and residents for financial decisions. It avoids financial conflicts of interest and can supplement the medical curriculum.

TI  - Determination of the Financial Literacy Characteristics of Prisoners: The Case of Turkey, a Developing Country
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENAL LAW AND CRIMINOLOGY-CEZA HUKUKU VE KRIMINOLOJI DERGISI
AB  - Increasing crime rates and prison occupancy are major problems for every country. Previous studies were conducted in countries with high national incomes. Therefore, there is a gap in the literature as to whether different results can be achieved in countries with different income levels. For this reason we aimed to determine whether the level of financial literacy differs between types of crimes, and, if there is a difference, which types of crimes are associated with low financial literacy. The quantitative data set consists of a survey conducted in February 2020, with 670 out of the 712 convicts incarcerated in the Manisa E-type closed penal institution in western Turkey who agreed to respond. Within the scope of the study, the basic and sophisticated financial literacy of convicts were measured and then basic and sophisticated literacy indices were created. There are 3 hypotheses in this context. Ht: The convicts have lower financial literacy than the general public hypothesis is not rejected. H2: The level of basic financial literacy of convicts varies according to the types of crimes hypothesis is not rejected. H3: The convicts have lower levels of financial sophistication then other disadvantages groups hypothesis is rejected. Our financial literacy indices indicated that the prisoners' basic financial literacy levels were closely related to various demographic factors whereas the level of financial sophistication was weakly related to them. Individuals imprisoned for grievous bodily harm and murder had the highest financial literacy levels, and were similar to levels in the general Public. Regarding sophisticated literacy, all respondents had high literacy levels for asset pricing, risk diversification, fees and deductions, and concepts.

TI  - Financial well-being amongst elderly Australians: the role of consumption patterns and financial literacy
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - Consumption behaviour and financial literacy are primary factors in determining the financial well-being of retirees. This paper uses an existing financial literacy index to examine how financial literacy directly, and via an interaction with consumption patterns, affects elderly Australians' financial well-being. We find that most elderly Australians hold an optimistic attitude towards their financial situation, and those who are relatively older, more educated, healthier and outright homeowners are more likely to report higher levels of financial well-being. Financial literacy significantly improves financial well-being. It also helps strengthen the positive effects of meeting more of non-essential consumption needs on financial well-being.

TI  - Financial literacy, investment and personal financial management nexus: Empirical evidence on private sector employees
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper aims to examine financial literacy, investment decisions and personal financial management nexus among the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) employees in the private sector in Ghana. The study employed a structured questionnaire with close-ended questions to collect data from 400 respondents using convenience sampling approach. The study adopted a Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) for analysis. The results of the study reveal a positive significant link between personal financial management and financial literacy; a positive significant correlation between investment decision and personal financial management; and a mediated effect of investment decision between financial literacy and personal financial management. This implies that individuals need to receive training in appropriate money management techniques in order to foster a more competitive and effective market for consumption and savings. The theoretical contribution of this study follows the theory of planned behavior phenomenon where the psychology factors influence the investment decisions of individuals. This present study originates by examining financial literacy, personal financial management and investment decision nexus among private sector employees.

TI  - Determinates of financial behavior: insights into consumer money attitudes and financial literacy
T2  - SERVICE BUSINESS
AB  - As consumer requirements for financial services permeate society, they link various financial institutions more closely together, developing divergent financial products. This research develops a conceptual framework for discussing consumer money attitudes, financial literacy regarding financial decisions, and financial behavior. Study findings suggest that consumers who have retention-planning and achievement-esteem attitudes toward money make high-risk financial decisions; anxiety toward money tends to exist mainly in low-risk investors. Financial literacy affects consumer financial behaviors, and demographic variables play segmentation roles. Theoretical contributions and management implications are provided in the study for related research, education departments and financial firms.

T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The main purpose of this Empirical study is to explore the impact of financial literacy can help to promote financial investments among college students and how financial literacy programs and knowledge are vital for all college students. This research study explores the impact of financial literacy in promoting financial investments. The very most influencing variables in investment planning are financial knowledge, financial risk perception, and Cost of investment. The practical implications are giving information about the financial curriculum framing for the college students which might have an impact on financial investment, the total sample collected was 121 from different colleges, where 8 respondents did not fill correctly, so the relevant sample size was 113. After initiating primary data collection using a questionnaire with measuring and ranking scales the variables such as financial knowledge, risk perception, and cost of investment were found out. During the study, we found that financial literacy is a significant factor that has a considerable effect on risk perception. The perception of risk has been removed or even shifted after taking up some financial courses because it provides considerable changes and choices of financial investment and it is also pressurizing or budding the managers of concerning field, especially investment. financial literacy has an influencing relationship with investment planning. As the demographic variable of study, Age and education have a significant impact on financial literacy. So finally, above all analysis, we can state that financial literacy plays a fundamental role in financial investment planning. Higher education institutions that want to update their educational programs must keep financial literacy in mind while developing syllabi for every institution. Courses with a direct tie to financial investment planning can be given additional weightage. Students should be able to apply their financial knowledge in practice through stimulating games, case studies, industry visits, and internship opportunities

TI  - Investor Financial Literacy, Decision-Making Behavior, and Stock Price Volatility-Evidence From Behavioral Experiments
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE PSYCHOLOGY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Financial literacy is generally considered to be an important factor affecting investors' decision-making, but there is no unified conclusion on whether the improvement of financial literacy can improve the degree of rational decision-making of investors. This article aims to examine whether the improvement of financial literacy can improve the rationality of investors from the perspective of investment psychology and behavior, and on the other hand, to further analyze the impact of the improvement of investor group financial literacy on stock prices. We designed three sets of mutually controlled investment evolutionary game experiments and analyzed the experimental results. We found that the improvement of financial literacy can help investors overcome the "Framework Effect" and "Heuristic Deviation," significantly improve the rationality of investors' decision-making, reduce stock price volatility and improve stock pricing efficiency. The results provide strong empirical evidence for the necessity of investors' financial literacy education.

TI  - Characteristics of Chinese Lottery Consumers' Financial Literacy and its Relationship with Problem Lottery Gambling
T2  - JOURNAL OF GAMBLING STUDIES
AB  - Problem lottery gambling among lottery consumers has increased globally over the years, rendering it necessary to explore their financial literacy characteristics and to answer whether financial literacy inhibits problem lottery gambling. In the present research, a total of 316 Chinese lottery consumers, who constitute the culturally underrepresented samples in the extant literature, completed a survey about financial literacy and problem lottery gambling. Using the propensity score matching method, we compared financial literacy between Chinese lottery consumers and Chinese general population (N = 10,058). The results showed that the five facets of financial literacy (i.e., financial knowledge, financial capacity, financial management values, financial ethics, and wealth values) among Chinese lottery consumers were significantly lower than Chinese general population. Among Chinese lottery consumers, their Homo sociologicus index (including financial ethics and wealth values) negatively predicted problem lottery gambling, but the Homo economicus index (including financial knowledge, financial capacity, and financial management values) was not significantly associated with problem lottery gambling. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings were discussed.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS JOURNAL-RESEARCHING ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - This article analyses the impact of an entrepreneur's financial literacy upon innovation within small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and, in so doing, extends human capital theory to consider the effect of financial literacy on risky investment decisions. Using a large survey dataset of Chinese SMEs in 2015 and 2017, our findings suggest that financial literacy is positively associated with innovation; positive relationships are robust to different innovation metrics. In addition, we find that gender matters, as male owners appear to promote more innovations, while firm size is positively associated with innovation. Additional analysis suggests that risk tolerance is a transmission mechanism for the impact of financial literacy on innovation. Our results corroborate previous studies showing that individuals with greater financial literacy make sound personal financial decisions and so have important public policy implications.

AB  - The objective of this study is to determine the variables that explain the knowledge of financial literacy among college students in Tuxtepec, Oaxaca, and to identify whether the level of financial literacy that prevails in these students differs by gender, age and school grade. To do so, the study is based on a theoretical reference recently exposed by Goyal and Kumar (2021), who analyzed 502 articles between the years 2000 to 2019, in their findings they found that the gender gap and financial education, impacts on financial behavior. The participants of the study were 600 college students of a public sector Institution. The statistical procedure for data analysis was: first, the instrument was validated with Cronbach's alpha and normality through the values of skewness and kurtosis, then the correlation matrix, Brattle's test of Sphericity with Kaiser and the sample adequacy measure were calculated, and the extraction of components under the criterion of eigenvalues > to 1 and total variance. Finally, to verify if there is a difference in relation to the variables of financial education, gender, age and employment status, an ANOVA analysis is performed. Finally, the findings show that there is a difference between the variables: Gender and financial literacy (Saving and Investment); Age (Spending and Credit); Employment Status (Income, Money Management, Spending and Credit, Saving and Investment). This leads us to think that the higher level student presents a low level of financial knowledge, which could affect their personal growth, and that the gap of gender, age and employment status makes a difference in relation to the variables studied.

AB  - Consumptive behavior is the behavior of consuming goods that are actually less or not needed (especially in relation to the response to the consumption of secondary goods, namely, goods that are not really needed). This study aims to determine the influence of factors such as lifestyle, financial literacy, and social demographics on the consumptive behavior. The population in this research is students of STIE Bank BPD Jawa Tengah who had taken entrepreneurship I and II courses, with a total of 230 students, while the sample is determined by using accidental sampling technique and using Slovin formula, which obtained 70 samples. Quantitative data are used, and data collection method in this study is questionnaire. The analytical tool in this study is the multiple regression analysis. Data is processed by using the SPSS program 21. The results showed that there were positive influence of lifestyle variable on student consumptive behavior; positive influence of financial literacy variable on student consumptive behavior; and positive influence of social demographics on student consumptive behavior. The most dominant variable influencing consumptive behavior is variable X3 (social demographics) with a regression coefficient value of 0.510, followed by variable X1 (lifestyle) and variable X2 (financial literacy).

TI  - Financial literacy and financial well-being among generation-Z university students: Evidence from Greece
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - Financial knowledge has become an essential skill because of the instability of global markets, asymmetric information in those markets, increasing complexity of financial products, and the rapidly increasing growth in financial technology (Fintech). This study aims to be the first among its kind to evaluate the relation between financial literacy, financial fragility, and financial well-being in parallel with identifying their determinants. For this purpose, we design and distribute a questionnaire to a random sample of 456 university students in Greece. The university students represent Generation Z that experienced the effects of a unique in duration and consequences financial crisis. We analyze the data by using cross-tabulations, chi-square tests, logistic regressions, and a marginal effect analysis. The results show that male students, students who keep expense records, or their father is highly educated are more financially literate. We also examine the dimensions of financial fragility, and the results show that financially literate students are better able to cope with an unexpected financial shock. Thus, financial literacy can be a key driver of financial well-being among Greek university students. Furthermore, we discuss the likely policy prescriptions while accounting for related behavioral aspects and technological developments.

TI  - Accelerating the impact of financial literacy training programmes on household consumption by empowering women
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - This study examines the impact of a joint financial literacy and women's empowerment training programme on household consumption as a welfare indicator. Using data collected from a randomized controlled trial implemented in Ghana, we tested for baseline balance and applied ordinary least squares to estimate endline impact. Our findings revealed that the impact of financial literacy on household consumption is influenced by the design and delivery of the programme. A weaker impact is achieved when financial literacy training is offered alone. The ensuing stronger short-term impact of financial literacy training on household consumption is achieved through the inclusion of a women's empowerment module. The joint delivery of the programme significantly improved household consumption for female-beneficiary and younger households. We advocate the inclusion of women's empowerment training in financial literacy training programmes to accelerate its impact on household welfare through increased household consumption

AB  - Purpose This study aims to analyze the effect of the Finlite mobile app on the financial literacy of undergraduate business students in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a quasi-experimental pre-intervention design. The data are collected using a quiz and a questionnaire. Cluster sampling is adopted for three different zones in Malaysia. A total of 400 business students enrolled in economics courses participated in the intervention. Findings The results indicate that Finlite significantly promotes students' savings intentions, practices, decision-making, accountability, values and financial literacy. All results are analyzed based on gender and race. However, Finlite does not significantly help overcome students' financial issues such as credit card debt and poor spending behavior. Practical implications Financial literacy may be efficiently promoted through digital tools integrated into economics courses. Young adults can make optimal financial decisions after graduation. Future research should explore different courses, addressing undergraduate and high-school students. Originality/value Previous studies predominantly examine attitudes and behaviors related to financial literacy. In contrast, this study measures the ex post impact of the Finlite mobile app on savings intentions, practices, decision-making, accountability, ability to overcome financial issues and value for money.

TI  - The Impact of Financial Socialization and Financial Literacy on Financial Behaviors: An Empirical Study in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The research aims to evaluate college students' financial behavior and provide empirical insight into factors that may influence their financial behavior by investigating whether financial socialization, financial experience, and financial literacy are meaningful for students' financial behavior. The surveys data was conducted with 595 college students from all over Indonesia then analyzed using Structural Equation Model (SEM). The results demonstrate that financial socialization positively influences financial literacy and financial behavior. On the other hand, financial experience has a negative influence on financial literacy, yet a positive one on financial behavior. Furthermore, the result also shows financial socialization are the key determinant of financial literacy and financial literacy is vital and plays an essential role for financial behavior and it may derive from financial socialization and financial literacy. It indicates that the influence of social agents can benefit students in improving their financial literacy and behavior. However, experience also can influence their financial behaviors. The lack of experience of college students leads to inadequate financial knowledge and raises their risk of financial decisions. Students with sufficient financial knowledge and exhibiting good financial behavior can make wise decisions in financial planning and management, thus may prevent financial issues in the future.

TI  - Financial literacy, confidence and well-being: The mediating role of financial behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - This study aims to investigate the impact of financial literacy and confidence on the financial well-being of US households and to explore the mediating role of financial behaviors in this relationship. To do this, we analyzed a large dataset from the two most recent waves of the state-by-state National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), covering a representative sample of US adults (n = 43,104). Results from multiple regression and mediation analyses, adjusted for relevant controls, show that financial literacy influences financial well-being directly and indirectly (mediated) through financial behaviors. Our analyses further indicate that financial confidence has a positive impact, directly and indirectly through financial behaviors, on financial well-being. Overall, our results suggest that higher levels of financial literacy and confidence lead to more responsible financial behavior, which, in turn, influences financial well-being. The findings of this study provide a valuable addition to the literature and directions for future research.

TI  - Research on influences of education and financial literacy on commercial insurance purchase in China
T2  - PACIFIC ACCOUNTING REVIEW
AB  - PurposeWith the rapid development of the economy in China, the wealth of residents has continued to increase, and most families have gradually been aware of the importance of commercial insurance. The family purchase of insurance in China was still not optimistic. Many scholars focus on wealth allocation, but the attention to the commercial insurance market was still less. Based on previous research studies, this study aims to investigate the impact of education and financial literacy on the commercial insurance purchase in China.Design/methodology/approachChina Household Finance Survey data was used to investigate the purchase of commercial insurance in Mainland Chinese families. Factor analysis was used to construct financial literacy, and the education data were combined to analyze the commercial insurance purchase using the Probit model and the Tobit model. Finally, the contributions of education and financial literacy to commercial insurance purchases were analyzed.FindingsBoth education and financial literacy exerted a positive impact on the purchase of commercial insurance in China. Individual characteristics such as gender, age, marital status, risk attitude, purchase of social insurance and consultation with a financial advisor possessed significant effects; household factors like household size and assets, macro factors such as the density of financial institutions and the density of financial industry staff, and regional factors as local unemployment rate excreted influences on the commercial insurance purchase.Originality/valueBased on the current economic development in China, this study investigated and expressed opinions on the public and insurance companies regarding commercial insurance purchases. It accentuated financial literacy and education as factors that facilitated commercial insurance development.

TI  - DOES FINANCIAL LITERACY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN NON-LIFE INSURANCE DEMAND AMONG EUROPEAN COUNTRIES?
T2  - EKONOMSKI PREGLED
AB  - While risk aversion and affordability of insurance are considered as the most important determinants of non-life insurance demand, understanding and knowledge of complex non-life insurance products are less researched. Studies on insurance demand conducted at the cross-section level, which include education, usually use it as a proxy for risk aversion and to a limited extent as a measure of financial literacy. Moreover, the general level of education does not accurately reflect the level of understanding of sophisticated insurance instruments. Consequently, the main aim of this research is to analyse the impact of financial literacy on the demand for non-life insurance by applying a more precise measure of financial literacy. The empirical analysis is based on the dataset of 38 European countries in the period from 2010 to 2016 and is done using the panel data analysis technique. Research findings confirm that financial literacy makes the difference in non-life insurance demand among European countries, while controlling for other economic, sociall cultural, market structure and institutional determinants of non-life insurance demand. The paper contributes to the literature on non-life insurance demand, especially the one on the relationship between financial literacy and the demand for non-lye insurance.

TI  - Role of Financial Literacy and Peer Effect in Promotion of Financial Market Participation: Empirical Evidence in Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The research examines how interactions of financial literacy and peer effect indicators impact financial market participation of Vietnamese investors. In this research, financial literacy indicator is constructed from two levels, namely, basic financial literacy and advanced financial literacy. An empirical study was carried out by investigating 387 individuals who are currently working in finance-related areas such as banking, insurance and real estate industries. The findings indicate that individuals with higher level of financial literacy, specifically those with advanced financial literacy level, tend to participate in financial market. However, individuals with basic financial literacy level tend to walk away from financial market because the nexus between basic financial literacy and financial market participation is found negative statistically significant. The findings also suggest that peer effect and perceived financial literacy have a positive significant relationship with financial market participation. These findings remain robust after endogenous problem is addressed by employing instrument variable (IV) method, especially Ivprobit regression. Hence, these findings recommend that policy-makers should design and develop financial literacy programs, specifically at sophisticated level, to adapt and overtake the trend in financial innovation development. This should be done, not only on individual, but also national scale to ensure greater financial market participation.

TI  - Energy-related financial literacy and retrofits of Soviet-era apartment buildings: The case of Lithuania
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper extends the literature on energy-related financial literacy by examining its role in collective energy retrofit investment decisions in Soviet-era countries, which suffer from suboptimal levels of these investments, purportedly due to a lack of energy-specific knowledge and financial skills as well as low levels of trust. We investigate whether energy-related financial literacy and trust help explain collective energy retrofit investment decisions of typical Soviet-built multi-dwelling buildings in the case of Lithuania. Using unique survey data from Lithuania, we find that individuals' willingness to invest in multi-dwelling building energy retrofits is positively associated with individuals' general financial literacy, energy literacy, and energy-related financial literacy. Furthermore, we show that individuals' trust in institutions that are directly involved in the house-retrofitting process is an important predictor for multi-dwelling building energy retrofit decisions.

TI  - The effects of financial literacy and materialism on the savings decision of generation Z Indonesians
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - The purpose of this research is to analyze the influence of financial literacy and materialism on the savings decision of Indonesia's generation Z. This study was motivated by the country's agenda to achieve financial inclusion and develop human resources throughout the nation. We distributed questionnaires to 430 university students to measure their financial literacy score and materialism level, as well as the savings rate of every respondent. Through a series of regression analyses, we find that (i) age, gender, and major of study significantly influence financial literacy score; (ii) financial literacy positively influences savings decision; and (iii) materialism negatively influences savings decision. Our findings generally foretell favourable financial conditions for future generations of Indonesians. Finally, we also strongly recommend policymakers to start integrating financial education as a compulsory part of every school's curriculum, regardless of level.

TI  - Financial literacy and its determinants among the schedule tribes: evidences from India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose - Despite a lot of developments in the financial markets, financial illiteracy is a main concern across the world and is directly associated with faulty financial decisions making. The situation is very alarming among a socially or economically marginalized section of society as they cannot afford to pay finance professionals for their wealth management. The objective of the study is to understand the level of financial literacy as well as its determinants among the marginalized section of society living in hilly areas.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is descriptive as well as empirical in design and based on primary data collected from the 300 scheduled tribe households of Himachal Pradesh a hilly state of India.
   Findings - The study observed that financial literacy is very low among the scheduled tribes living, and their level of education, income, family system and Internet accessibility have a significant impact on their financial scores.
   Practical implications - The outcome of the paper may be useful to design customized awareness programs, and financial products focusing on scheduled tribes living in far-flung areas so that they can get the benefits of market-driven financial products.
   Social implications - Financial awareness can help scheduled tribes in their financial inclusion thereby reducing poverty and inequality through informed financial decisions. Thus, the outcome if implemented can help in achieving the objective of inclusive growth.
   Originality/value - No specific work has been done to explore the level as well as the determinants of financial literacy among the scheduled tribe households living in hill areas. This paper will fill this gap and contributes to the existing work on financial literacy and inclusion.

TI  - Understanding the Determinants of Saving in Ghana: Does Financial Literacy Matter?
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Domestic savings remain low in Ghana despite several attempts to improve this situation. Whereas existing studies on private savings have identified several determinants, the role of financial literacy in saving decisions has not been explored. In this paper, we build on existing studies and provide evidence supporting our hypothesis that financial literacy is key to promoting domestic saving. The study relies mainly on primary data, and the binary probit regression model is employed as the estimation technique. Our results show that improving financial literacy among Ghanaians should be incorporated into the broad policy package aimed at increasing domestic saving which is a prerequisite for investment and subsequently sustainable economic growth.

TI  - Collaborative Curriculum Design in the Context of Financial Literacy Education
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Financial literacy education is being integrated into school curricula at an increasing frequency. However, the majority of teachers lack the required competencies and teacher self-efficacy to effectively teach financial topics. In this study, we evaluated whether participation in teacher design teams (TDTs) results in high-quality educational materials, encouragement of professional learning, and ultimately, enhanced teacher self-efficacy in the face of pending curriculum reform. We conducted an exploratory multiple-case study in Flanders, Belgium. Data were collected from two TDTs that developed materials aligning with the financial literacy learning standards. We observed the team meetings and conducted interviews with the participating teachers and the team coach. Our results suggest that participation in TDTs supports the three outcome variables that we examined. However, they also revealed that each outcome shows room for improvement. Furthermore, the data provided additional evidence for the importance of meeting several input and process factors that had been previously shown to be essential for effective TDT function.

TI  - The Relative Impact of Income and Financial Literacy on Financial Inclusion in Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This study uses survey data of over 22 000 respondents in Nigeria, to provide evidence for the impact of two key drivers of financial inclusion: financial literacy and income levels. The study shows that financial literacy significantly determines savings patterns with formal and informal financial institutions; however, income only drives the frequency of informal savings. The results also highlight the demographic groups suitable for financial literacy and other interventions aimed at improving financial access. The findings will support the market segmentation capabilities of financial services providers and also guide regulators in formulating policies that will improve and deepen financial access.

TI  - Is Awareness That Powerful? Women's Financial Literacy Support to Prospects Behaviour in Prudent Decision-making
T2  - GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Financial literacy is of utmost relevance in the field of entrepreneurship, especially in developing countries. However, what builds financial literacy and how it shapes investment decision-making of women entrepreneurs is an exiguously researched area. Building on this gap, this study postulates that women entrepreneurs' prospect behavioural factors (loss aversion, regret aversion, mental accounting, and self-control) impact their investment decision process through the intervening role of financial literacy. Based on a stratified sample of 579 women entrepreneurs operating in Punjab, Pakistan, structural equation modelling was used to analyse the hypothesized relationship among variables. Findings showed that loss aversion, regret aversion, mental accounting, and self-control significantly influenced women's financial literacy and investment decision process, whereas no impact of regret aversion was traced on investment decision-making. Thus, our results offered robust support that financial literacy stimulated by women entrepreneurs' prospect behaviour invigorates their investment decision power.

TI  - Unraveling the impact of financial literacy on investment decisions in an emerging market
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We examined the impact of financial literacy on investment decisions, taking a sample of 384 investors from India. A multi-dimensional construct to measure financial literacy was developed basis the theory of planned behavior. Investment decisions were measured by taking six proxies on a five-point Likert-type scale. The causal link between financial literacy and investment decisions was examined using simple linear and binary logistic regression. The results exhibited moderate to high levels of financial literacy among investors. Results further confirm that investors' investment decisions are positively influenced by their financial literacy levels. It is concluded that financial literates have a greater likelihood of making informed investment decisions. These outcomes have practical implications for policymakers, managers, employers, and investors, especially in an emerging market context, making a case for relevant financial education programs to empower investors. The study adds to the theory of financial literacy developing a multi-dimensional construct and introducing Macroeconomic Factors as a proxy for investment decisions.

TI  - Shaping Investment Decisions Through Financial Literacy: Do Herding and Overconfidence Bias Mediate the Relationship?
T2  - GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - The present study aims to answer the question of whether herding and overconfidence bias serially mediate the relationship between financial literacy with equity investors' decision-making in the Indian stock market. A survey method was deployed to collect primary data from 436 individual equity investors in the north Indian region. PLS-SEM has been used to examine the serial mediation-based model proposed for the study. Financial literacy was found to have a considerable favourable influence on individual investors' decision-making. The relationship between financial literacy and investors' decision-making was found to be serially mediated by herding and overconfidence bias. The study proposes that investors should attend financial market courses, training programs, conferences and seminars to improve their financial literacy and understanding, allowing them to overcome behavioural biases, and will improve their decision-making.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - PurposeThe low level of financial literacy among young adults is a pressing concern at both individual and country levels. Therefore, there is a dire need to understand the best-worst antecedents of financial literacy and how they influence each other.Design/methodology/approachA two-phased multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) technique consisting of best-worst method and interpretive structural modeling (BWM-ISM) was employed for pair-wise comparison, assigning weights, ranking and establishing the relationship among antecedents of financial literacy.FindingsResults suggest that use of Internet (SF1), role of financial advisors (SF3) and education level of individuals (DS7) are top ranked antecedents, whereas masculinity/feminity, language and power distance in society are the least ranked antecedents of financial literacy. Findings will help both academicians and practitioners focus on the key factors and make efforts to increase financial literacy by minimizing resource usage.Originality/valueThe current study provides clarity among antecedents of financial literacy by following BWM-ISM approach for the first time in the financial literacy context.Peer reviewThe peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/IJSE-11-2022-0746

TI  - Impact of financial literacy on savings behavior: the moderation role of risk aversion and financial confidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - This research examines the impact of financial literacy on the savings behavior of investors residing in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. It also investigates the moderating impact of financial confidence and risk aversion in the relationship between financial literacy and savings behavior. The primary data were collected from 357 respondents through a structured questionnaire using the snowball sampling method. The findings of this study suggest that financial literacy has a positive impact on investors' savings behavior. Further, the study also found that risk aversion significantly moderates the relationship between financial literacy and savings behavior. The three-way interaction between financial literacy, risk aversion, and financial confidence significantly affects the investors' savings behavior. The study suggests that policymakers should emphasize training programs for investors on financial literacy, financial confidence, and risk aversion.

TI  - Financial literacy and financial strategies: The mediating role of financial concerns
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - This article analyses how the financial literacy of elderly people affects their decisions on the adoption of various financial strategies. Multiple mediator models with bootstrap techniques are used to identify the mediating mechanisms of financial concerns that transmit the effects of financial literacy onto specific financial strategies. We find (1) financial concerns mediate the majority of financial literacy-strategy nexuses; specifically, financially illiterate people are more likely to have financial concerns and are more likely to cut back on spending, seek job opportunities, increase debts and downsize or sell their residence as a result; (2) financially literate people are more likely to seek professional financial advice, purchase a life annuity, contribute more to superannuation and invest more conservatively, regardless of their concerns. Our findings suggest professional advisors and robo-advisor developers take into account financial concerns when recommending advice. JEL Classification:D14, J14, J26, I31, G11

This study applied structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS software to analyze the data and then to estimate the relationships between financial literacy and market discipline. Findings This study shows that financial knowledge, financial skills, and financial behavior can improve market discipline. This study also provides empirical evidence that financial behavior has a mediation effect on the relationship between financial skills and financial knowledge to the market discipline. Research limitations/implications The results show that all financial literacy latent variables have a significant positive effect on market discipline. Financial behavior has a mediation effect on the relationship of financial skills and financial knowledge with market discipline. Depositors with good knowledge of financial products and services, who are skillful in managing their money and who demonstrate good financial behavior can effectively discipline the market. They will punish imprudent banking by actions such as the withdrawal of their funds. Financial literacy significantly enhances market discipline. Practical implications This study provides recommendations for regulators, practitioners, academics, and depositors, that is, the actors in the financial industry, on the need to empower consumers with financial literacy, while also promoting market discipline to recognize the importance of these two aspects for the sustainability of financial stability. Originality/value This study provides empirical evidence for the market discipline literature, using a behavioral approach, namely, the action of withdrawal of funds. The study then estimates the relationship between financial literacy, that is, financial knowledge and financial skills, and market discipline, with financial behavior as the mediating variable.

TI  - Financial literacy, access to digital finance and performance of SMEs: Evidence From Central region of Ghana
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This paper expands on financial literacy, access to digital finance, and SME performance in the Central Region of Ghana. First, the study analysed SMEs' digital platform knowledge and utilisation. It examined the relationship between financial literacy, access to digital finance, and SME performance. The paper discussed the mediating influence of access to digital finance on SMEs' financial literacy and performance. The study employed the quantitative research approach. Using the purposive sampling technique, a total of 400 responses were gathered from SMEs in Cape Coast, Mankessim, Assin Fosu, Agona Swedru, and Kasoa. The study used self-administered questionnaires to collect data. SPSS was employed to evaluate descriptive statistics. Results show that SMEs in the study areas use Mobile Money more than any other digital platform. PLS-SEM was used to investigate the relationship between financial literacy, digital finance, and SME performance. It was found that financial literacy positively affects access to digital finance. Also, access to digital finance improved performance. Access to digital finance mediates the relationship between financial literacy and SME performance. Access to digital finance is as crucial as financial literacy for increasing performance. Therefore, using digital platforms to trade would boost business performance. Digital trading platform providers should improve advertising and make their systems user-friendly.

TI  - Financial literacy: an exploratory analysis in Portugal
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - This work aims to verify, through an exploratory factor analysis, which are the determinants of the financial literacy of the Portuguese over 18 years old. The quantitative method is used, by using a questionnaire survey, and 839 surveys were obtained. It is observed that the factors resulting from the exploratory factor analysis are: (1) planning and financial goals to 1-2 years, (2) long-term savings and (3) the taste for numerical calculation. We analyse the statistically significant differences between means regarding gender, school education, the existence of household budgets and age. It is concluded that it is important to obtain some financial training at the beginning and throughout life, to better be able to make the financial family planning, to make applications with better return and to reduce the financial risk of the family. It is concluded that the closer to the retirement age, the more people tend to save, since during retirement income usually decreases.

TI  - Too much or less? The effect of financial literacy on resident fraud victimization
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AB  - Fraud not only damages the wealth and reputation of individuals, but also poses a threat to social security. Although the relationship between financial literacy and resident fraud victimization has been discussed in recent studies, previous research has ignored the ways in which residents make psychological decisions when faced with fraud, and findings have not been agreed upon. The purpose of this study is whether and how financial literacy influences fraud victimization in the risky decision-making process. Under dual process theories, this study constructs regression models using the survey sample (N = 16352) from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). Our findings show that there is a U-shaped relationship between financial literacy and fraud victimization, and that this relationship is heterogeneous across gender. Further analysis found a moderating effect of Subjective Risk Attitudes (SRA) on this relationship, with risk preferences causing the U-shaped relationship between financial literacy and resident fraud victimization to gradually shift to a monotonic positive relationship. In addition, we consider the problem of endogeneity, which has been neglected in previous studies, and construct a new instrumental variable to address endogeneity. Our study provides some new insights into the behavioral analysis of residents' economic decisions.

TI  - How does financial literacy impact on inclusive finance?
T2  - FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB  - Inclusive finance is a core concept of finance that makes various financial products and services accessible and affordable to all individuals and businesses, especially those excluded from the formal financial system. One of the leading forces affecting people's ability to access financial services in rural areas is financial literacy. This study investigated the impacts of financial knowledge on financial access through banking, microfinance, and fintech access using the Bangladesh rural population data. We employed three econometrics models: logistic regression, probit regression, and complementary log-log regression to examine whether financial literacy significantly affects removing the barriers that prevent people from participating and using financial services to improve their lives. The empirical findings showed that knowledge regarding various financial services factors had significant impacts on getting financial access. Some variables such as profession, income level, knowledge regarding depositing and withdrawing money, and knowledge regarding interest rate highly affected the overall access to finance. The study's results provide valuable recommendations for the policymaker to improve financial inclusion in the developing country context. A comprehensive and long-term education program should be delivered broadly to the rural population to make a big stride in financial inclusion, a key driver of poverty reduction and prosperity boosting.

TI  - Market Impact Analysis of Financial Literacy among A-Share Market Investors: An Agent-Based Model
T2  - ENTROPY
AB  - Financial literacy has become increasingly crucial in today's complex financial markets. This paper explores the impact of financial literacy on the stock market by establishing an artificial financial market that aligns with the characteristics of the Chinese A-share market using agent-based modeling. The study incorporates financial literacy into investors' mixed beliefs and simulates their behavior in the market. The results show that improving individual investors' financial literacy can improve market quality and investor performance, as well as reduce the unequal distribution of wealth to some extent. However, the phenomenon of speculative trading and irrational behavior in the market can pose potential risks that require regulatory measures. Thus, policy recommendations to improve individual investors' financial literacy and establish corresponding regulatory measures are proposed.

TI  - Transition to sustainable business models for green economic recovery: role of financial literacy, innovation and environmental sustainability
T2  - ECONOMIC CHANGE AND RESTRUCTURING
AB  - Research on sustainable business models and climate change is the focus of this article, which examines the industry, business and sustainability which has attracted a lot of attention. Because of this, we are investigating the effects of implementing business sustainability capabilities using a multiple-case methodology. An original report on China's small- and medium-sized businesses provided the data for this study that examined the theoretical and empirical relationships between financial literacy, innovation and environmental conservation. We devised a conceptual model to demonstrate the impact of corporate sustainability skills and competencies on climate change. Endogeneity concerns connected to financial literacy, innovation and ecological sustainability necessitate the employment of an instrumental variable for climate change. After adjusting for individual and firm characteristics, we found that financial literacy may substantially impact a company's sustainable business model. The findings suggest that financial literacy may boost company innovations by relieving financial restrictions and enhancing corporate governance, both of which contribute to the development of sustainable businesses that assist in increasing climate change mitigation efforts. On the other hand, innovation has a more significant influence on low-leverage companies. There was also a lot of talk about climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in the business context. This research, therefore, sheds light on how business sustainability capabilities and competencies might improve a company's environmental performance.

TI  - Financial Literacy in Ukraine and Hungary with special regard to the Performance of University Students
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - In 2002, the governments of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) formally recognised the importance of financial literacy. It was then that the organisation launched a project to survey financial literacy, which has been called the International Network on Financial Education (OECD/INFE) since 2008. The organisation's 132 member countries take part in regular surveys, each using a uniform methodology. This method has become so popular with researchers that it is used by countries that are not members of the organisation/project. Ukraine is one of them. In this work, the authors compare the results of the Ukrainian study with the Hungarian data, taking advantage of the identity of the methodology. The choice fell on these two countries because the authors had an affiliation in Ukraine, but one of them lives in Hungary, so he has a personal relationship with both countries. The choice of topic was determined by the fact that one of their areas of scientific research is the study of the financial literacy of university students. The OECD published the results of its latest survey in 2020. The report also contains Hungarian data. The results show that the performance of both countries studied is close to, but not below, the OECD average; however, they are very close to each other. Nevertheless, the financial cultures of the two countries are significantly different. Ukrainians are more characterized by active management of finances, while Hungarians are attracted to finances above average. In addition to presenting the national results, the authors also compare the performance of Hungarian and Ukrainian university students in financial literacy.

TI  - From Financial Literacy to Financial Capability: A Preliminary Study of Difference Generations in Informal Labor Market
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This study aims to investigate whether financial attitude links financial literacy to financial capability. To make sound financial decisions, one essentially requires a certain level of financial literacy - knowledge and skill in finance. Even more effective is when one's financial literacy could be developed into financial capability. The samples comprised 342 individuals from informal labor in the South of Thailand. The stratified multistage sampling technique was utilized to select the respondents, while the interview questionnaires were used to collect the data. By using SmartPLS 3.0, the data analysis included descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling (SEM). The result revealed that the one with the highest debt was Gen Y compared to Gen B and Gen X. Considering financial literacy, financial attitude, and financial capacity across generations, it was found that Gen Y had the highest average score in financial literacy and financial capacity, higher than that of Gen X and Gen B. The impact of financial literacy on financial capability through financial attitude, it was found that the impact on Gen B was higher than that of Gen X and Gen Y. With the right financial attitude, people of all generations would be equipped with a higher level of financial capability.

TI  - Impact of Financial Literacy and Behavioural Biases on Investment Decision-making
T2  - FIIB BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Investors' financial literacy entails making sound investment decisions and the behavioural biases or irrational behaviour in decision-making that are collectively formed by heuristic bias, framing effect, cognitive illusions and herd mentality factors. The present study examines the combined impact of financial literacy and behavioural biases on investment decisions. A questionnaire was developed using Likert scaling technique to elicit study variables and collected data was analysed using SEM technique. The results showed that heuristic bias had a significant positive association with the creation of behavioural bias in decision-making. However, the framing effect, cognitive illusions and herd mentality have negative associations in the formation of behavioural biases. Further, investors often practice and follow heuristic biases rather than other irrational techniques for making investment decisions. Therefore, the financial literacy of individual investors has a significant impact on affecting stock market investment decisions.

TI  - The differential impact of cognitive style on the relationship between financial education and financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - Past studies have examined the role of financial education on financial literacy, often with mixed results. While some studies have shown a positive effect, others have indicated null or even negative effects. Given that much public faith is given to financial education as a means for improving consumers' financial wellbeing, a deeper understanding of the relationship between financial education and financial literacy is needed. A factor that may moderate this important relationship is cognitive style, which reflects the information processing strategies of consumers. At the two extremes of the cognitive style spectrum are analytical and intuitive consumers, and in the intermediate ranges are adaptive consumers who combine analysis and intuition to different degrees. Using a national panel of American consumers, the moderating role that cognitive style plays in this relationship is empirically examined. The findings indicate that while consumers with analytical and intuitive cognitive styles develop higher financial literacy levels as a result of financial education, the financial literacy levels for consumers with adaptive cognitive styles diminishes with financial education. The potential role of self-assessed investment knowledge in this relationship is examined and implications on curriculum design for financial education programs as well as related research needs are discussed.

TI  - Financial literacy or investment experience: which is more influential in cryptocurrency investment?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate how financial literacy and investment experience impact cryptocurrency investment behavior and explore which factor is more influential in cryptocurrency investment. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of US individual investors from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study Investor Survey, a three-step hierarchical logistic regression was conducted following a model-comparison approach. In addition, a mediation analysis was conducted using the Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) method to further explore the mediating effect of investment experience between financial literacy and cryptocurrency investment. Findings This study found that while both financial literacy and investment experience were positively associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, investment experience was more influential in cryptocurrency investment. The findings also demonstrated that investment experience, especially risky asset holding, had a significant mediating effect between subjective financial knowledge and cryptocurrency investment behavior. Practical implications The findings of this study offer insight to researchers by providing a deeper understanding of the determinants of cryptocurrency investment in the United States. This study also provides detailed implications for financial institutions, financial professionals and policymakers to guide rational cryptocurrency investment behavior. Originality/value This study is one of the initial attempts to explore the determinant factors in cryptocurrency investment, an area that has rarely been studied in the literature.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Financial Education, and Downstream Financial Behaviors
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - Policy makers have embraced financial education as a necessary antidote to the increasing complexity of consumers' financial decisions over the last generation. We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of financial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201 prior studies. We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples. Like other education, financial education decays over time; even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational studies that measure financial literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies, and we find that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial literacy to control for omitted variables. Financial education as studied to date has serious limitations that have been masked by the apparently larger effects in correlational studies. We envisage a reduced role for financial education that is not elaborated or acted upon soon afterward. We suggest a real but narrower role for "just-in-time" financial education tied to specific behaviors it intends to help. We conclude with a discussion of the characteristics of behaviors that might affect the policy maker's mix of financial education, choice architecture, and regulation as tools to help consumer financial behavior.

TI  - The impact of the CEO's financial literacy on family SMEs' growth: the moderating role of generational stage
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose This study investigates the impact of the CEO's financial literacy on family SMEs' growth, as well as the moderating role of the generational stage on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on survey data of Spanish private family firms and utilizes a second source of data, the SABI database by Bureau Van Dijk. The authors run ordinary least squares regressions and use both the base and the partition approaches to test the hypotheses. Findings The analysis reveals a positive association between the CEO's financial literacy and firm growth. However, this relationship is not uniform across generations. The CEO's financial literacy-firm growth relationship becomes weaker for first- and third or subsequent-generation family firms while becoming stronger for second-generation family firms. Originality/value This study adds the financial literacy of the CEO as a novel individual-level determinant of family firm growth. It also shows that CEOs do not always use their financial literacy to its full potential to foster growth. More specifically, the extent to which financial literacy leads to firm growth is found to be conditional on the generational stage of the family SME. The obtained findings are valuable for family SMEs intending to hire a new CEO, encouraging the financial literacy of the current CEO and educating the next generation of family members.

TI  - Financial literacy and quality of life: a moderated mediation approach of fintech adoption and leisure
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose - This study explores the relationship between financial literacy and quality of life (QoL). The study further examines the mediating effect of fintech adoption and the moderating effect of leisure on the relationship between financial literacy and QoL.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using convenience sampling, 345 respondents participated in a cross-sectional survey. To test the moderated mediation hypotheses, the PROCESS macro was used.
   Findings - The results reveal the mediating effect of fintech adoption on the relationship between financial literacy and QoL, highlighting the importance of digital literacy in an increasingly digitalized society. Moreover, leisure moderates the mediating relationship. Individuals with high leisure are more likely to perceive the uncertainties and risks associated with new technology optimistically -an observation supported by existing literature on the relationships among leisure, perceived freedom, and internal locus of control.
   Practical implications - Financial literacy must incorporate digital literacy in order to utilize innovative technology for more efficient financial management. Additionally, having a sense of control over life outcomes can lead to well-being.
   Originality/value - Previous research on fintech adoption is mostly related to financial inclusion for the unbanked population in underprivileged rural areas. Here, fintech usage by the general public is the focus. The study also reveals the significance of leisure, as those who have high financial literacy are more likely to adopt fintech when they have more freedom in their lives, which leads to higher QoL.

TI  - Antecedents of the Youngster's Awareness About Financial Literacy: A Structure Equation Modelling Approach
T2  - VISION-THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
AB  - Financial literacy has been identified as an important functional area that attains a special concern in the Indian government policies and plans specially designed for the financial market. SEBI has issued various guidelines and awareness programs towards investment financial products, digital payment systems, consumer protection and so on. Therefore, the purpose of the present article is to analyze the level of financial literacy among youngsters in India. The study examined the relationship between the antecedents of financial literacy, that is, financial attitude, financial knowledge and financial behavior. The theoretical purposed model was tested with the help of primary data that was collected with the help of the self-structured questionnaire. A total of 647 responses were obtained from the respondents belonging to the holy city Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India. To identify the financial literacy antecedents and their inter-relationship, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling were applied to the collected data. The findings indicated that in the case of the Indian population, financial attitude and financial behavior were significantly associated with financial literacy. The moderation analysis reveals that males are more particular about financial knowledge and financial behavior in comparison to females. Respondents belonging to the age group of 26-30 years have better financial knowledge. Respondents who have income more than (sic)800 thousand and below two years have more financial knowledge. This article contributes to the theoretical body of knowledge by providing insights about the interesting topic of financial literacy by identifying its antecedents. The study also highlights the impact of the demographic variables as moderators on the antecedents of financial literacy. The outcomes of the study are vital for the government in the designing of public policies. The findings are helpful for the educational program designers for the outlining of the programs and syllabus for the subjects taught in the schools and colleges. The findings are useful for the bank managers to understand the psychological behavior as well as demographic variables for the effective marketing and communication of their financial products.

TI  - Understanding the financial literacy of undergraduate students at Thai universities
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & FINANCE LIBRARIANSHIP
AB  - This paper explores the financial literacy of undergraduate students at Thai universities. Four hundred questionnaires were distributed to undergraduate students based on systematic random sampling and the results were analyzed by descriptive statistics. The participants knew about simple interest, basic savings, investment risk, and inflation but were confused about compound interest. Most had no savings and had faced financial problems during the last 6-12 months. They were also happier with spending than saving. Owing to such financial illiteracy, educational courses that include financial concepts and skills must be offered to improve students' financial attitude and behavior.

TI  - Strengthening Formal Credit Access and Performance through Financial Literacy and Credit Terms in Micro, Small and Medium Businesses
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study aims to test financial literacy and credit conditions in determining formal credit access to determine the performance of MSMEs. This research includes the type of associative research that is accompanied by hypothesis testing. This research was conducted on MSMEs of as many as 324 creative industry players in four cities in East Java (Mojokerto, Pasuruan, Gresik, and Sidoarjo) with a sample size of 100 actors who had accessed formal credit using the stratified random sampling method for data collection. The results of Smart PLS analysis show that financial literacy and credit terms directly and significantly affect access to formal credit and MSME performance; formal credit access directly and significantly affects MSME performance. Likewise, financial literacy and credit terms indirectly affect the performance of MSMEs. These results mean that financial literacy and credit terms have a strategic role in explaining why access to formal credit is growing and is attracting MSMEs to strengthen capital to improve performance.

TI  - Is It Necessary to Launch a School-Based Financial Literacy Curriculum? Evidence From China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - As starting university is a critical independence milestone for many young people, it would also be the best time to provide them with some financial education (FE). Although there have been many initiatives aimed at enhancing individual financial literacy (FL) and/or financial decision-making, meta-analyses have shown that the effectiveness of FE has been mixed. This study examined the driving forces behind the decision by college students to enroll in a targeted financial literacy curriculum (FLC) and the impact of this attendance on their FL. An endogenous switching model (ESM) was employed to account for the heterogeneity in the decision to attend or not attend the FLC and to counteract any unobservable characteristics. It was found that students with higher self-perceived FL did not prefer to attend the FLC; however, for others, FLC attendance was found to significantly boost their FL in areas such as financial knowledge (FK), financial attitude (FA), and financial behavior (FB), especially for the non-attendees under the counterfactual framework. These "non-attendees" were observed to have some characteristics (e.g., prior knowledge) that made them more financially literate regardless of attendance; however, if they had attended the FLC, they would have gained a greater FL than the attendees. As the FL of the attendees would have been much lower if they had not attended, the FLC appeared to be particularly important for the attendees, which strengthened the case for making the FLC a compulsory part of a general college education.

TI  - Family Communication, Privacy Orientation, & Financial Literacy: A Survey of U.S. College Students
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Increasing personal financial responsibility has increased the value of financial literacy in recent decades, leading to an emphasis on financial literacy and educational programs. However, these educational efforts have demonstrated mixed results, necessitating further research regarding the influences on personal financial knowledge and capabilities. The present study explores the effect of family socialization, specifically through an analysis of family communication patterns and privacy orientations, hypothesizing that open dialogue regarding financial matters will encourage transmission of knowledge and a willingness to seek information when needed. Reporting on the results of an online survey of college students, the results imply that individuals from more communicative families report stronger financial literacy. This finding suggests that financial literacy education programs might be more pedagogically useful if they incorporate and facilitate conversation around financial matters. The findings also reinforce the necessity of financial education.

TI  - Does Financial Literacy Improve Financial Inclusion in Developing Countries? A Nonlinearity and Quantile Regression Analysis
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - This study investigated the nexus between financial literacy and financial inclusion using the cross-section threshold regression model and the quantile regression technique. The sample covered 73 developing countries categorised as lower-middle income or upper-middle-income economies. The main results of the threshold model revealed that financial literacy had no inverted U-shaped effect on financial inclusion in the sample of developing countries. This situation indicated that financial literacy had a linear or monotone relationship with financial inclusion. The quantile regression model was used to compare the findings in this investigation. The empirical result indicated that the financial literacy variable had a limited impact on the conditional distribution of financial inclusion. However, the coefficient values were much larger at high than low quantiles. This study's results are necessary for policymakers and financial institutions to implement financial literacy programs targeted at specific behaviours and underserved populations in developing countries.

TI  - Early Causes of Financial Disquiet and the Gender Gap in Financial Literacy: Evidence from College Students in the Southeastern United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - Financial literacy, a cornerstone of family economic well-being, is surprisingly low in the United States. The literature has established that financial literacy is lower among women than among men. As sound financial decision-making among both male and female household heads is of paramount importance to well-being, we look to identify the underlying causes that may initiate and perpetuate this differential. We found that a gender-based gap in understanding develops by early college age, before individuals have had the opportunity to develop financial skills through experience or specialization in household roles. The literature indicates that women tend to underestimate their abilities relative to men, particularly in areas of math and financial decision-making. Math ability, financial confidence, and financial and math education have been found to enhance financial literacy, and so we focus on math self-efficacy as an early indicator of financial assurance and literacy. Using an ordered probit model and data from a sample of 529 college students across three institutions in the southeastern United States, we extend the current literature to find that for men, objective math ability drives financial literacy. For women, on the other hand, self-efficacy-and not objective ability-is predictive of financial literacy. Understanding the underlying causes of the gender-based financial literacy gap can inform the creation of better education, family, and cultural intervention methods by which to close this gap in financial literacy, decisions, and outcomes.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper investigates the dynamics of individual portfolios in a unique innovation test conducted through a digital financial literacy platform-saalt. We conduct the test at the University of Luxembourg and ask students to construct their own financial portfolios, choosing from among 500+ financial assets; students could adjust their portfolio weights at any time using their registered accounts. Moreover, we stimulate the sharing of portfolio information among students through class presentations and Facebook postings. We find relatively sophisticated diversification strategies and clear momentum-chasing behaviour for winning stocks; we also discover rapid convergence of individual portfolios to the provided benchmark portfolios. Finally, we find significant peer influences in the test. In general, financial literacy spreads rapidly among students.

TI  - Overcoming resistance barriers in mobile banking through financial literacy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - An overlooked component of innovative service adoption is consumers' resistance barriers. Mobile banking is no exception, and the present study focuses on several barriers' (i.e., usage, value, risk, tradition, image, time, privacy and trialability barriers) influence on mobile banking use. This study further investigates the extent to which financial literacy may offset these barriers. Financially literate people have been shown to have better financial decision-making skills and hence might perceive lower resistance barriers. Binary-logit models are estimated to investigate the impact of resistance factors and financial literacy on mobile banking adoption. Findings of an online survey of 405 respondents from Turkey have confirmed usage, time and privacy barriers as significant determinants of adoption while establishing that financial literacy-particularly financial activeness-overcomes the usage barrier. Our results also reveal that higher financial sophistication heightens privacy barriers. Finally, we confirm the lower likelihood of elderly users and lower-income groups adopting mobile banking.

TI  - How financial literacy and demographic variables relate to behavioral biases
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how financial literacy and demographic variables (gender, age, income level, education, occupation, marital status and investment experience) related to behavioral biases. Design/methodology/approach The study uses one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), factor analysis and multiple regression analysis to examine survey data from more than 500 individual investors in India. Findings The results reveal the presence of different behavioral biases including overconfidence and self-attribution, the disposition effect, anchoring bias, representativeness, mental accounting, emotional biases and herding among Indian investors. Hence, the findings support the view that individual investors do not always act rationally. The results also show that financial literacy has a negative association with the disposition effect and herding bias, a positive relation with mental accounting bias, but no significant relation with overconfidence and emotional biases. Age, occupation and investment experience are the most important demographic variables that relate to the behavioral biases of individual investors in the sample. Regarding gender, males are more overconfident than are females about their knowledge of the stock market.

TI  - Children's understanding of financial literacy and parents' choice of financial knowledge learning methods in Malaysia
T2  - METHODSX
AB  - Financial literacy is an essential lifelong skill that should be taught to children at any age. It holds the key to develop a generation of adults who are knowledgeable about money and the economy. Additionally, OECD (2018) suggests that using digital tools could significantly enhance financial literacy and well-being. Therefore, this paper aims to: (i) assess the financial literacy level of primary school children in the northern region of Malaysia and (ii) explore interactive and engaging methods for teaching financial literacy. The sample size was determined using Krejcie and Morgan's (1970) approach, resulting in 419 primary school students aged 7 to 12 and their parents. An online questionnaire was employed, and multi-regression analysis was conducted. The findings highlighted those primary students displayed a high level of financial literacy, scoring above 80 % on the questionnaire. Furthermore, parents expressed a preference for their children to enroll in personal finance subjects offered by schools, have financial assignments or activities at school, and engage in online financial games. The study emphasized the crucial roles of schools, teachers, and active parental involvements to enhance financial literacy. This study recommends incorporating interactive and attractive teaching methods through in-class and online activities at the school level.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between financial literacy and long- and short-term financial behaviors by age group for those without a college degree. Financial literacy was measured and discussed in the context of three components: objective financial knowledge, confidence in financial knowledge, and financial ability. Financial ability was significant in each age group and had the highest odds ratios of the three components of the financial literacy construct for the short-term index. Both confidence in financial knowledge and financial ability were significant in each age group for budgeting while objective financial knowledge was not. The results suggest that confidence in both knowledge and ability are important influences on positive financial behaviors for those without a college degree.

TI  - Household financial literacy and relative poverty: An analysis of the psychology of poverty and market participation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Financial literacy is the significant human capital factor affecting people's ability to obtain financial services. Evaluating the relationship between financial literacy and relative poverty is of great significance to poverty reduction. This study investigated the impacts of financial literacy on relative poverty from the perspective of poverty psychology and market participation using data from the 2017, 2019 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). The empirical findings showed that financial literacy can alleviate relative household poverty through household participation in entrepreneurial activities, commercial insurance participation and the choice of lending channels. Financial literacy has significant poverty reduction effect on households of continuous operation, reduces the likelihood of exiting operation. Further discussion showed that the poverty reduction effect of financial literacy is more pronounced among households with higher levels of financial literacy, under the age of sixty, low levels of indebtedness and in the eastern region. Our study provides empirical evidence for encouraging market participation and promoting financial literacy and provide valuable recommendations for the policymaker to improve poverty reduction effect in the developing country context.

TI  - The impact of teacher engagement in an interactive webinar series on the effectiveness of financial literacy education
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB  - This study examines whether online teacher professional development (OTPD), in the form of an interactive webinar series that encourages collaborative learning, improves student achievement. We conducted a randomised controlled trial with 1102 students, 45 teachers and 30 secondary schools in Flanders, Belgium. As a basis for the study, we developed a digital learning path aimed at improving student scores on financial literacy-a multidimensional key competence recently integrated into the curriculum. We demonstrate that the learning path improves student learning outcomes and that enhanced teacher involvement in this programme does not increase learning outcomes unless the teachers participate in the OTPD initiative. Teacher engagement in the webinar series generated student learning outcomes 0.39 standard deviations higher than those of students whose teachers did not receive this intervention, thus, confirming the effectiveness of the OTPD initiative. This effect was found immediately after programme implementation, and it persisted until at least 6 weeks later. As an underlying mechanism, we observe that engagement in the webinar series enhances teachers' self-efficacy. Classroom observations suggest that engagement increases the frequency of providing students with content-related help.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Cultural Dominance, and Financial Well-Being of SME Owners in Ghana
T2  - POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - The literature on the relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being is growing but yet to consider whether the social support emanating from cultural settings conditions this relationship. The main objective of this article was to assess the role cultural values (Protestantism and Catholicism) played in explaining the financial well-being of small- and medium-scale enterprise (SME) owners in a developing economy, Ghana. On the basis of 300 randomly selected SME owners, an ordinary least squares technique was employed to establish this relationship. The results highlight that the level of financial literacy of SME owners tends to influence their financial well-being. In addition, Protestant ideology weakens financial wealth acquisition process of SME-Owners. Lastly, the study found little support for the assertion that culture moderates the relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being. Consequently, the study recommended that policies aimed at promoting financial education for financial well-being should not neglect the cultural context of beneficiaries.

TI  - Determinants of financial literacy among university students: Insight into background and exposure characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & FINANCE LIBRARIANSHIP
AB  - This article examined the level of financial literacy among university students in Ghana (N = 3932), and investigated which factors are linked with the different financial literacy components. This article is motivated by the increased drive toward financial inclusion and the critical role of financial knowledge in an increasingly sophisticated financial world. The framework used, assesses students' knowledge in money management, savings and borrowing, investments, and insurance. The research findings show moderate knowledge in savings and borrowing but low level of knowledge in other finance issues among university students. Notably, the findings reveal that gender, work experience, subject of study, and mother's level of education are all important determinants of financial knowledge among the students. The findings further show that students with relatively high financial knowledge are more likely to have sound judgment on financial issues; make the right financial decisions and have sound personal financial management practices. Based on the findings of the study, a national policy on financial literacy and educational programs are urgently needed as intervention to improve the level of financial knowledge of university students.

TI  - Investing in Rural Agriculture in the Face of Innovative Financial Services: Does Financial Literacy Matter in Nigeria?
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - The complex nature of formal financial products and services and the frequently associated innovations occasioned by disruptive technologies inform researchers' calls for studies on financial literacy, particularly in African rural communities. As a response to the calls, this study explores how financial literacy relates to performance, access to credit facilities, and payment preferences among smallholder rural farmers in Nigeria. Further, the rural farmers' financial literacy level on each of the four dimensions of the Standard and Poor Global Financial Literacy criteria was assessed. A random sample was drawn from the registered rural farmers in the Central Bank of Nigeria's Anchored Borrower's Program for the 2022 farming year. Quantitative data were collected from rural farmers using the Standard and Poor Global Financial Literacy questionnaire. The proposed hypotheses were tested with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), while descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The outcomes show that financial literacy significantly predicts performance, access to credit facilities, and mode of payment preferences among smallholder rural farmers. Also, the analyses of the four dimensions of financial literacy show that the farmers are more literate in risk diversification and inflation than numeracy and compound interest. It is concluded that financial literacy is cardinal to profitable investments in rural farming, and as such, there is a need for the Nigerian government and financial authorities to embark on financial literacy drive with more emphasis on numeracy and compound interest where the rural farmers are more deficient.
   Purpose: This study explored how financial literacy relates to performance, access to credit facilities, and mode payment preferences among smallholder rural farmers in Nigeria. Further, the rural farmers' financial literacy level on each of the four dimensions of the Standard and Poor Global Financial Literacy criteria was assessed. Methods: A random sample was drawn from the registered rural farmers in the Central Bank of Nigeria Anchored Borrower Program for the 2022 farming year. The proposed hypotheses were tested with partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), while descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Conclusion: It is concluded that financial literacy significantly influences performance, access to credit facilities, and mode of payment preferences among smallholder rural farmers in Nigeria. Practical Implications of Findings: The outcomes suggest a need for the Nigerian government and financial authorities to embark on a financial literacy drive with greater emphasis on numeracy and compound interest, where the current study found rural farmers to be more deficient. Also, the current findings on Nigerian rural farmers' mode of payment preference behavior could guide the government and financial authorities in formulating financial inclusion policies as well as helping payment card companies make strategic decisions to increase the overall performance of the payment system in Nigeria.

TI  - Financial literacy and its determinants: the case of rural farm households in Ghana
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the determinants of rural dwellers financial literacy in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional primary data set was used to estimate the factors influencing rural farm households' financial literacy using the IV-Tobit model. Findings The findings reveal that most rural residents are financially illiterate. The econometrics model results depicted that respondents' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as gender, income, age and education significantly affect financial literacy. Again, respondents who are risk seekers and listen or watch education programs are more likely to be financially literate. Research limitations/implications The paper examined the determinants of rural dwellers financial literacy in four regions in Ghana. Future research should consider all or many regions for an informed generalization of findings. Practical implications This paper provides evidence that rural dwellers are financially illiterate and it would require the policymakers or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to establish a village or community group that comprises a wide range of bankers and government officials to help rural dwellers acquire some financial skills. Also, the positive relationship between media (whether respondent watches or listens to educational programs) and financial literacy implies that policymakers should focus on improving individuals' financial knowledge through training programs and utilize the media as a channel to propagate financial education to the public. Originality/value Although previous studies have examined the determinants of financial literacy, little is known in developing countries and, in particular, rural communities. The authors fill this gap by contributing to the scanty existing literature in developing countries in several ways. First, this is the first study to examine the financial literacy level of rural dwellers in Ghana. Second, to not undermine the credibility of the estimation results, this study addresses the potential endogeneity issue, which other researchers have not adequately recognized. Finally, the study expands the scant literature on the subject and provides critical policy implications that will help policymakers formulate financial market policies that will contribute to rural dwellers financial literacy enhancement.

TI  - Assessing the Effect of Financial Literacy Among Managers on the Performance of Small-Scale Enterprises
T2  - GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - The small-scale sub-sector continues to be a fundamental catalyst for job creation and economic growth in Ghana. About 35 per cent of labour is provided by the sub-sector and shows the importance of harnessing its potentials in developing the Ghanaian economy. It has been established that financial literacy has a significant influence on whether or not small-scale enterprises succeed. Yet, the exact effect of financial literacy on small-scale enterprise performance has not been fully identified in Ghana, hence the need for the present study. This study examines the effect of financial literacy (awareness, attitude and knowledge) of managers on the performance (financial and non-financial) of small-scale enterprises in the La Nkwantanang Madina Municipality of Ghana. Primary data were obtained from 200 small-scale managers through structured questionnaires. The data were analysed using structural equation model. The results revealed a significant effect of financial literacy on firm performance (both financial and non-financial performance). Also, all the three components of financial literacy (awareness, attitude and knowledge) have a significant positive effect on both financial and non-financial performance. However, individual characteristics (age of the individual, educational level and experience) have no significant effect on financial performance, whereas tax becomes useful when used as a regulatory tool of small enterprises. Capacity building programmes are therefore recommended to increase financial literacy among managers/owners of small-scale enterprises.

TI  - Survey of Hungarian High School Students' Financial Literacy in the Last 10 Years Based on the Econventio Test
T2  - PUBLIC FINANCE QUARTERLY-HUNGARY
AB  - The Econventio Association in cooperation with the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration of the University of Szeged has been developing the financial literacy of high school students since 2011. In our study, we summarize the main findings of surveys over the past 10 years, based on a total of 110,000 responses. Our findings show high school students to have inadequate and superficial financial knowledge. The results show that high school students have low financial literacy levels. Financial knowledge is positively related to long-term oriented thinking, the opinion formed about self-sufficiency and self-care, and the general attitude towards finances. In addition to the ever-increasing role of digital financial information sources, high school students draw their financial knowledge mainly from what they see at home, which influences test scores in a negative way, while at the same time financial literacy education has a positive effect on students' financial literacy. As age and experience increase, the level of financial knowledge increases too, especially in the topics of labour market, credits and loans and insurance, however, the problematic areas remain the same over time, both for high school students and the adult population: calculating interest, compound interest, the meaning of expressions 'at least' or 'at most, or comparing different financial offers.

TI  - Does self-control moderate financial literacy and savings behavior relationship? A case of micro and small enterprise owners
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - It is vital to understand Saving Behavior at an individual level, since an individual member of society initiates capital accumulation / mobilization. Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) have been provided credit facilities solely as a source of financing for a long time, but there has been increasing concern lately that MSEs require not only credit but also savings that have risen to the top of the financial services for this market. Micro and small business owners, however, often struggle to save, even if they have surpluses. This is attributed to the lack of incorporation of cognitive factors, financial indiscipline and lack of vision. This study examines the moderating effect of self-control on the relationship between financial literacy and saving behavior using cross-sectional data from 395 micro and small business owners in Kampala, Uganda.The study used a quantitative, positivist research approach. Process macro was used as a statistical tool for analyzing the data gathered using a questionnaire. The study was guided by the social cognitive theory. Results indicate that both financial literacy and self-control significantly predict saving behavior. Besides, the relationship between financial literacy and saving behavior is moderated by self-control. Furthermore, the findings suggest that individuals with low self-control require a lot of financial literacy in order to have a positive effect on their savings behavior relative to those with high self-control because even though they go through financial literacy training, its effect on savings behavior would be negligible. This means that first evaluation of their self-control levels is required before individuals are taken for financial literacy training. Therefore it is advised to determine the self-control of an individual before they are taken for training in financial literacy.

TI  - Gender differences in risky asset behavior: The importance of self-confidence and financial literacy
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - This paper studies the role of individuals' confidence in own financial literacy in explaining the gender gap in investment in risky assets, while controlling for actual financial literacy and risk aversion. It is the first paper to assess the role of confidence independent of actual financial knowledge for a large set of countries and it is the first to explore the role of confidence by using counterfactual decomposition techniques. Results from our analysis confirm recent findings of modern behavioral finance: confidence is a strong determinant of risky financial behavior and accounts for a large part of the gender gap.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC EDUCATION
AB  - In this article, the authors present the adaptation and validation processes conducted to render the American Test of Financial Literacy (TFL) suitable for use in Germany (TFL-G). First, they outline the translation procedure followed and the various cultural adjustments made in line with international standards. Next, they present results from the validation of the TFL-G's content and relations between test scores and external variables, including test takers' prior economic education and interest in economic topics. Preliminary analyses of data gathered from expert interviews and cognitive labs, and the results of the first administration to first-year higher education students (N = 1,108) indicate that the TFL-G is a valid instrument to assess young adults' understanding of personal finance in Germany. Perspectives for future research are discussed.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL LITERACY ON THE INVESTMENT DECISION OF NON-DONATION-BASED CROWDFUNDING IN INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - The present study investigates the heterogeneity of the financial literacy level between backers and nonbackers of non-donation-based crowdfunding in Indonesia and how the financial literacy relates to the country's decision to invest through non-donation crowdfunding. We choose Indonesia for a case study because non-donation crowdfunding has become a new investment mode recently in this area. The study extends the analysis to the predictors of financial literacy and its impact on the investment decision of non-donation crowdfunding. The hypotheses are examined through binary logistic regression. The study's findings are as follows. First, there is heterogeneity in the financial literacy level between backers and nonbackers. Second, the financial literacy level is found to be affected by residence, education, income, and stock market product ownership. Third, investors in crowdfunding have a tendency to be in the younger age group. Fourth, males have a higher tendency to invest in non-donation crowdfunding than females, despite the lack of difference in financial literacy between them. Fifth, individuals in the lowest income group are more likely to invest in non-donation crowdfunding than individuals with larger incomes.

TI  - Financial Literacy Level on College Students: A Comparative Descriptive Analysis between Mexico and Colombia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - This main objective of this study is the measurement of financial literacy in college students from Mexico and Colombia, using an instrument that was designed based on the available literature review and which was applied to a sample of 224 students. It was possible to find slight differences between the two countries, but the results as a whole were concerning as they showed a low level of financial literacy in the analyzed population, specifically in the topics of retirement planning, inflation, credit (credit card usage), savings and investment and risk diversification. This paper also proposes a questionnaire considering seven financial topics which measures the level of financial literacy and can be replicated in other study populations.
   It is important to point out that college students are an important opportunity to focus the efforts on financial literacy, since they are in a crucial stage of their lives when they are beginning to get into the work force or will do so soon, which is why this information can be used in a near future and by having it they can use financial instruments in a proper manner and for their benefit, helping them to achieve their financial goals and avoid financial problems during their life, contributing to their future wellbeing and society in general.

TI  - Empowering mobile money users: The role of financial literacy and trust in Vietnam
T2  - BORSA ISTANBUL REVIEW
AB  - While other countries have implemented mobile money very early with promising results, Vietnam, a bank-based country, only started the pilot implementation in November 2021. By the end of the pilot period, the percentage of people with mobile money accounts still needs to reach expectations. In this respect, our study focuses on financial literacy and perceived trust by analyzing consumers' intention to use mobile money. The results of the analysis show that six factors affect the intention to use mobile money, including (1) Perceived Usefulness, (2) Perceived Ease of Use, (3) Perceived Risk, (4) Perceived Value, (5) Financial Literacy, and (6) Perceived Trust. Although perceived trust does not have the most decisive direct impact, it plays a mediating role in promoting the intention to use mobile money. Perceived Trust helps users significantly increase their perceived usefulness and intention to use. Perceived Trust also indirectly increases the Perceived Value in the intention to use mobile money. In addition, the newly constructed financial literacy factor also significantly impacts the intention to use mobile money. The research results help clarify the role and mechanism of perceived trust in the intention to use mobile money. At the same time, it helps managers consider increasing the capacity of mobile money through perceived trust and financial literacy in a country where the banking system has been relatively expanded.

TI  - Teaching financial education in schools and students' financial literacy: A cross-country analysis withPISAdata
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS
AB  - In the last decade, developed and emerging economies have become increasingly aware of the importance of ensuring that their citizens are financially literate. Eighteen countries and economies, including 13 OECD countries, participated for the first time in 2012 on the financial literacy assessment of 15-year-old students. Financial literacy scores varied according to the participating countries, and they were determined by factors related to the teaching-learning process, especially those related to the delivery of financial education in schools. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the provision of financial education in the school curriculum across all the countries that participated in PISA 2012-data from 2015 did not allow such analysis. We measured the direct effect of different ways of financial education delivery on students' financial literacy scores, after controlling for math and reading performance, and individual characteristics of students and their schools. The majority of the countries have introduced financial education topics in the curriculum somehow. But only in the Flemish Community of Belgium, the United States, and Latvia-and to a lesser extent in Australia, Estonia, France, Israel, Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, and the Slovak Republic-the way how financial education (FE) is delivered is positively correlated with students' financial literacy scores: FE taught as part of business or economics courses in Belgium, FE taught as part of a cross-curricular subject in the U.S., and FE taught as part of mathematics in Latvia. Our main findings pose fundamental challenges for educational policy regarding school-based FE. The first is to decide at what age (grade) interventions should be introduced into the education system so that students are not only financially literate but also financially competent. The second is to devise instructional approaches that more effectively lead young people to put pertinent financial knowledge into practice and to do so correctly when they make financial decisions.

TI  - Financial literacy and inclusion for rural agrarian change and sustainable livelihood in the Eastern Cape, South Africa
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Finance and growth underpin the debate on the implication of financial literacy and financial inclusion for development among scholars. While financial inclusion and financial literacy are positioned as enablers of sustainable development, literature has failed to link the two with sustainable development, especially for rural agrarian dwellers in dire need of financial development attributes. Therefore, this study applied variance-based structural equation modelling to examine the implication of financial literacy and financial inclusion for the sustainable livelihood of rural agrarian settlers in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Global scales were adapted and validated before administering them to 283 farmers and subsistence businesses in the region. The results revealed that financial literacy positively and significantly influences financial inclusion (& beta; = 0.452) and the attainment of sustainable livelihood (& beta; = 0.444). Financial inclusion partially mediates the influence of financial literacy on sustainable livelihood (& beta; = 0.253), as it directly explains the province's sustainable livelihood (& beta; = 0.114). The study's implication informs structured intervention for improving financial literacy to assist the target group with access to requisite funding, which could support their economic activities for a decent living.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY OF STUDENTS IN CHOSEN UNIVERSITIES - RESEARCH PLATFORM FOR REGULATORY PROCESSES OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN SLOVAKIA
T2  - E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT
AB  - The main goal of this paper is to compare the level of financial literacy among the selected faculties of economics in Slovakia and to elaborate a comparison of financial literacy level at both input and output level, i.e. between the university students at the beginning of their Bachelor study and the university students who are in the final stage of their Master study. In addition, we want to analyze the level of financial literacy by means of practical tasks aimed at confirmation or rejection of the prospect theory principles. Concerning methods we statistically process our primary data which were collected through the survey 2015/2016 from Slovak University of economics in Kosice, Presov and Bratislava. Inter alia, we analyze correlative data dependence of selected variables. The survey is focused also on financial behavior of respondents and their skills in terms of financial literacy concept. Last but not least, we deal with features of respondents' financial decision making under the conditions of risk and uncertainty. At first, we show that statistically significant dependency of FL level on respondents' sex does exist. Male respondents reached higher FL than female ones. Hypothesis of better high school education of economy at Business Secondary School was rejected, rate of financially literate respondents who attended Grammar School or Business Secondary School is comparable. Subsequently, students in their last year of studies at EKF TUKE and NHF EUBA have significantly higher level of FL than those students who are at the beginning of their studies. Contrary, at FM PU the rate of financially illiterate first-year students was lower than the rate of financially literate students in their last year of studies. We found out a correlation of FL with decision-making based on prospect theory. The results of the presented research provide important information for policy makers who should reflect on present status of this issue in Slovakia.

TI  - Financial literacy, financial capabilities, and sustainable business model practice among small business owners in Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT
AB  - The study investigates how financial literacy and financial capabilities influence small firms' sustainability in Lagos and Ogun States, Nigeria. It employs a survey research design to collect data from 300 small business owners across the two States. Data collected were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique. The study shows that environmental sustainability, financial sustainability and social responsibility are significant determinants of small firms' sustainability in Nigeria. Financial literacy and financial capabilities practices also have a significant positive impact on firm sustainability. However, the use of savings product shows a significant adverse effect on firms' sustainability. The findings imply that financial literacy knowledge and practice in small business operations enhance firms' sustainability. The study recommends that small firms should incorporate sustainability models into their business operations and improve their financial knowledge to maintain sustainability. Small business owners should also invest their savings in an appropriate investment product that suits their risk tolerance.

TI  - The medium is the message: Learning channels, financial literacy, and stock market participation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - This paper investigates the effects of learning channels on stock market participation. More specifically, we investigate the direct effects of learning about financial matters from one's private network, financial advisors, and the media, as well as the moderating effects of financial literacy on the relationship between learning from these channels and stock market participation. Analyzing a unique cross-section data that combine survey data and bank register data on individual retail investors, we find that media is the only learning channel that increases the likelihood of owning stocks and the portfolio share invested in stocks. We also find that financial literacy has a significant moderating effect: Interactions point to the joint importance of learning from media and financial literacy for individuals' stock market participation. Our findings suggest implications to policymakers when designing financial education programs.

TI  - Past behaviour, financial literacy and investment decision-making process of individual investors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS
AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore the importance of past behaviour and financial literacy in the investment decision-making of individual investors and examines the validity of the theory of planned behaviour in this context. Design/methodology/approach The study used a self-administered questionnaire and adopted the convenience sampling technique followed by a snowball sampling method for the survey to collect data from the individual investors covering the four distinct states of India. Collected data were analysed on AMOS 20.0 using two-step structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings Results indicated a significant effect of all the predictive variables. Past behaviour showed no significant direct impact on investor's intention; however, it had an indirect significant relationship while mediated by the attitude of investors. The multiple squared correlation (R2) showed that the final model could explain 36% of the variance in investors' intention towards stock investment which signified a successful implementation of the TPB model along with external variables added to it. Moreover, Indian investors were found to be highly influenced, primarily, by social pressure which could be curbed through financial literacy.
   Practical implications - A significant importance of subjective norms was found on stock market participation which could be a strategic theme for the government and the policymakers to educate investors through their opinion leaders for increasing their participation. Moreover, by doing so investors could control their behaviour and take rational decisions.
   Originality/value
   This study extended the understandings of investor's decision-making behaviour using TPB by incorporating the two external variables viz., Financial literacy and past behaviour. The addition of past behaviour is perhaps the novelty of this article since such examination has not been conducted empirically especially in the case of developing countries like India.

TI  - Islamic financial literacy and Islamic banks selection: an exploratory study using multiple correspondence analysis on banks' small business customers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS
AB  - Purpose Although Islamic banks offer superior financial services than other interest-based conventional banks, they could not expand their share and dominate the markets in several Islamic countries. This problem could be attributed to some causes not addressed. The current study proposes Islamic financial literacy as an important factor that could help aggress this problem. Due to a wide variety of Islamic financial services and the lack of understanding of these services, the banks' small business customers are indifferent between Islamic and interested-based conventional services to finance their business. Design/methodology/approach This study uses the exploratory technique of multiple correspondence analysis to detect any potential role of Islamic financial literacy in customers' preference for Islamic banks over conventional ones. The potential effect was tested with other essential factors, such as the customers' age, gender, and educational level. This analysis was conducted on a data set from 2061 banks' small businesses customers using the mall-intercept survey method. Findings The study shows a low level of Islamic financial literacy among Yemeni banks' small business owners' customers. Furthermore, despite integrating some critical factors that could influence the actual bank selection process among Yemini banks' customers, the authors found a decisive potential role of Islamic financial literacy as one of the key determinants of bank selection preferences. Originality/value This is the first paper to explore the potential role of Islamic financial literacy on the actual selection between Islamic Banks and their counterparts: the conventional banks in Yemen. The research results could build a more comprehensive theoretical model on Islamic banks' customer behavior.

TI  - Exploring the relationship between investment choices, cognitive abilities risk attitudes and financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose The main purpose of this study is to investigate the investment choices' relationship with cognitive abilities, risk aversion, risky investment intentions, subjective financial literacy and objective financial literacy. Design/methodology/approach To examine the relationship, two investment choices were given to 256 subjects from Pakistan. Questionnaire had total 20 questions for measuring five variables. To review this nexus, discriminant analysis was used as to explore the depth of the nexus that is the ability of the variables to predict the investment choices. Findings This study establishes the findings that Investment choices are guided by risk aversion, risky investment intentions, financial literacy (subjective and objective) and cognitive abilities. The risk aversion has negative relation to investment choices and other variables depict positive relationship to with investment choices. Practical implications This study provides a new and useful understanding into the existing literature on investment choices. The results are significant as the cognitive abilities show a positive contribution to the investment choices. This is point of significance as the portfolio managers and advisors would get help in regards of advising investments as they are aware what factors impact the investment choices. Originality/value This study is novel in its nature to evaluate investment choices using the cognitive ability alongside risk attitudes and financial literacy.

TI  - Analyzing the linkage between Islamic financial literacy and Islamic banking services adoption: evidence from Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is twofold. First, this research explores the level of Islamic financial literacy of customers in the context of Islamic banking. Second, this study examines the determinants of customer adoption of Islamic banking in Turkey. Design/methodology/approachThis study gathered sample data from 409 participants determined using the purposive sampling method. In the study, first, the reflective measurement model is used to examine the reliability, validity and multicollinearity problems of the variables. Then, AMOS structural equation model (SEM) is used to reveal the relationship between Islamic financial literacy and Islamic banking services. Additionally, this study performed both descriptive and inferential analysis to understand customer literacy about Islamic banking and their adoption behavior of Islamic banking. FindingsThe results obtained from descriptive assessment indicate that Turkish customers of Islamic banking possess sufficient literacy about Islamic banking. Moreover, the results from SEM indicate that the adoption of Islamic banking by customers is significantly predicted by the role of Sharia Board management, Islamic banking and purpose of financial institution, religious factor and legitimacy of Islamic financial system. Research limitations/implicationsThis study focuses only on the level of knowledge and perceptions of customers who have accounts in Islamic banks or financial institutions in Turkey. It does not focus on the level of knowledge and perception of Muslims who do not have accounts in Islamic banks and financial institutions. Originality/valuePrevious studies on Islamic banking are mostly studies that investigate customers' perceptions of the Islamic banking system and why individuals prefer Islamic banks. In particular, studies examining the relationship between individuals' Islamic financial literacy level and Islamic banking preferences are limited. This study is considered to be an original study as it investigates the relationship between the Islamic financial literacy level of individuals and their adoption of Islamic banking services in Turkey.

TI  - Impact of financial literacy on financial inclusion and household financial decisions: exploring the role of ICTs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL STUDIES OF MANAGEMENT & ORGANIZATION
AB  - The objective of this paper is to assess the extent of financial literacy and the impact of access to and use of ICTs (information and communication technologies) on household financial decisions, such as savings, retirement planning, household budgeting, and engagement in financial markets. This study analyzes survey data collected from 409 households belonging to the low- and middle-income brackets across four cities in Pakistan. By employing probit model, it finds that a higher level of (advanced) financial literacy is associated with an increased likelihood of improved savings and household budgeting. However, the overall financial literacy score (basic plus advanced) is associated only with savings decision. Additionally, the results reveal that the ICTs adoption plays a role in influencing decisions related to financial market participation and savings. The results also show that financial literacy, along with ICTs, positively influences financial market participation and retirement decisions. Nevertheless, results suggest mixed impacts of financial literacy and ICTs on financial decisions which lends partial support to the study hypotheses. In conclusion, our results underscore the importance of financial literacy alongside ICT adoption to promote financial market participation and improve household financial management.

TI  - Responding to Islamic finance anomalies in Indonesia: Sharia financial literacy using virtual reality context
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the process by which the level of immersion in virtual reality-based behavioral simulation (VR-BS) impacts on the non-cognitive and cognitive outcomes. The cognitive outcome is measured using the increase in the level of Sharia financial literacy, while the noncognitive outcome is measured using the behavioral intention to use VR-BS.Design/methodology/approachThe method consists of two parts: First, the development of VR-BS, in the context of sharia financial literacy, using the waterfall model. Second, testing the effectiveness of VR-BS using the theory of interactive media effects framework. The participants were 142 students from three secondary schools (two Islamic religious schools and one public school) in Yogyakarta and Central Java, Indonesia. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used for testing the hypotheses.FindingsVR-BS creates a perceived coolness and vividness, which in turn has an impact on increasing the participants' engagement. Also, the use of VR has an impact on natural mapping, which increases a user's engagement through its perceived ease of use. As predicted, the user's engagement affects VR's behavior, mediated by the user's attitude toward VR media. VR's interactivity, however, does not impact on the cognitive aspect.Research limitations/implicationsThe participants were not randomly selected, as the data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the majority of the participants had never tried VR before this study. The participants, however, were digital natives.Practical implicationsIt is implied from the findings that Islamic financial business actors and the relevant government agencies (e.g. the Indonesian Financial Services Authority [OJK], the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology and the Ministry of Religious Affairs) should collaborate to best prepare the future generation of ummah by using VR-BS in their joint promotion and education programs. The results of the current study reveal that the use of VR-BS may attract people to engage in Islamic financial activities. By engaging in such activities, or at least engaging in real-life simulations/classes/workshops, people may gradually acquire more knowledge about Islamic finance.Originality/valueAs predicted, the user's engagement has an impact on behavior toward VR-BS, which is mediated by attitude toward VR-BS.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL SELF-EFFICACY ON PERSISTENCE: DO FINANCIAL LITERACY AND ENTREPRENEURIAL PASSION MATTER?
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - The primary purpose of the current study is to investigate the entrepreneurial self-efficacy as an antecedent to persistency among entrepreneurs. In addition to that, the study examines the mediating role of entrepreneurial passion between entrepreneurial self-efficacy and entrepreneurial persistence. Lastly, the study explored the relationship between financial literacy and persistence and its moderating role between entrepreneurial passion and persistence. Structural equation modeling through of partial least square bootstrapping resampling was used for hypotheses testing to analyze the data collected from a sample of 273 Malaysian entrepreneurs. The results of the study supported all arguments broached in the current research for the subjective norm, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, which showed a significant impact on entrepreneurial passion and entrepreneurial persistence. The moderating effect of financial literacy on entrepreneurial passion and entrepreneurial persistency was also highly significant. The current work is among the pioneering studies that examine entrepreneurial self-efficacy, entrepreneurial passion, financial literacy and entrepreneurial persistence among entrepreneurs.

TI  - How materialism shapes the effectiveness of financial literacy messages: A cross-cultural perspective
T2  - APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW-PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE
AB  - This cross-cultural experiment (N = 1000) shows that messages designed to promote financial literacy are differently effective among US and Arab consumers depending on the salience of materialistic thoughts at the time of exposure. Among US consumers, financial literacy messages increased savings intention by heightening the importance of saving when materialistic thoughts were salient but had no impact otherwise. This is consistent with existing research that has largely focused on WEIRD countries (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, Democratic; Henrich et al., 2010). However, among Arab consumers (data collected in the United Arab Emirates), we found that financial optimism was a key construct to explain savings behaviors. Specifically, our results show that financial literacy messages lower levels of financial optimism and, thus, increase savings intention at baseline levels. When materialistic thoughts are salient, our results suggest that Arab consumers prefer spending in the presence of financial literacy messages because having materialistic thoughts heightens financial optimism when one is assured that acquiring financial knowledge and skills guarantees one's financial success.

TI  - Investigating The Mediating Role of Financial Literacy on The Relationship Between Women Entrepreneurs' Behavioral Biases and Investment Decision Making
T2  - GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS
AB  - This study investigates the theoretical link between heuristic behavioral factors and the investment decision-making of women entrepreneurs, focusing on the importance of financial literacy as a potential mediator shaping prudent decision-making. We argue that women's financial literacy is an efficient way to apply behavioral considerations in wise decision making. Using the proportionate stratified sampling method, we collected data from women entrepreneurs who were formally registered in Punjab Province, Pakistan. Owing to the complex model and small sample size, the smart PLS method was applied to analyze the structural relationship between the measured and latent constructs. The results show that overconfidence and availability heuristics have a significant positive impact on investment decisions, while financial literacy plays an essential intervening role between the overconfidence heuristic, availability heuristic, and investment decision-making. Our results support the execution of financial literacy awareness among women entrepreneurs to stimulate their financial decision control and give them the independence to make prudent financial decisions.

TI  - Effect of Financial Technology on SMEs Performance in Cameroon amid COVID-19 Recovery: The Mediating Effect of Financial Literacy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The paper examines the mediating effect of financial literacy on fintech and SMEs' performance during COVID-19 recovery in Cameroon. The study collects 381 survey data from SMEs in Yaounde and Douala, the country's business hub, to determine how these financial technology innovations affect SMEs' business performance. Similarly, the PLS-SEM model was used to test the proposed hypotheses. The study results show that the relationship between fintech and financial literacy was positive and significant. The findings also reveal that fintech has a positive and significant effect on SMEs performance. In addition, the results further indicate that financial literacy positively and significantly mediates the relationship between fintech services and the performance of SMEs. Therefore, the study concludes that financial literacy is an essential mechanism through which fintech services influence SMEs' operational and financial performance in Cameroon. The study has provided a better understanding of how SMEs can improve their performance by leveraging fintech solutions through financial literacy.

TI  - Empirical investigation of the Fintech and financial literacy nexus: Small business managers' insights in Cameroon
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Recent and ongoing advancements in the field of ICT have led to the introduction of increasingly diversified financial products, and their use is improving people's level of financial knowledge and skills. This article aims at assessing the effect of Fintech on the level of financial literacy of small business' managers in Cameroon. To this end, information was gathered using a questionnaire from 209 small business managers in Cameroon. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), and multiple linear regression are used. Results lead to two main conclusions. On the one hand, unlike knowledge of their existence, the frequency of use of Fintech tools is better able to contribute to improving financial literacy levels overall. On the other hand, specifically, this result is of increased importance when it comes to competence and self-confidence in managing financial affairs. As a result, increasing the utilization of financial technology instruments in companies is imperative for efficiency.

TI  - The nexus amongst financial literacy, financial behaviour and financial well-being of professional footballers in Ghana
T2  - MANAGING SPORT AND LEISURE
AB  - PurposeThis paper examines the financial literacy, financial behaviour, and financial well-being of professional footballers in Ghana, and the interrelationships amongst these constructs.MethodologyA cross-sectional survey was conducted using 300 professional footballers from the Ghana Premiere League and the hypothesized relationships were tested using the partial least squares, structural equation modelling technique.FindingsThe results indicate low levels of financial literacy, and poor financial behaviour among footballers. The results suggest that to promote responsible financial behaviour amongst footballers, enhancing their financial literacy is key. We find very strong support for the argument that responsible financial behaviour, proxied in this study by savings and investment behaviour, is key to attaining financial wellness in life.Practical ImplicationsThe findings suggest that targeted policy initiatives aimed at enhancing the financial well-being of footballers should begin with investing in training programmes to make them financially literate. In addition, practical financial guidance should be given to footballers to help shape their financial behaviour.ContributionPrior studies on financial literacy, financial behaviour, and financial well-being have focused predominantly on professionals with industrial jobs. This paper extends knowledge in the field with some new insights from professional footballers.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Network Competency, and SMEs Financial Performance: The Moderating Role of Market Orientation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - Research on SMEs highlights their limited resources and the influential role of SMEs' owners/managers. In this respect, scholars stressed the importance of different capabilities possessed by owners/managers of SMEs in developing a competitive position and enhancing firm performance. This study intended to examine the direct influence of two fundamental capabilities: financial literacy and networking competency possessed by owners/managers of SMEs in China and the United Arab Emirate (UAE) on SMEs' financial performance. In addition, this research tested the moderating impact of market orientation. The quantitative research method was employed by administering structured questionnaires. A total of 150 and 120 questionnaires were collected from owners/managers of SMEs in China and UAE. Structural equation modeling was used for data analysis using Smart-Pls. Findings revealed that SMEs' financial performance was positively related to maintaining financial literacy and networking competency in both samples. Further, market orientation was found to strengthen the positive impact of financial literacy and networking competency on SMEs' financial performance in China. However, market orientation had a significant moderating impact only on the relationship between networking and the financial performance of SMEs in the UAE. This paper ends with providing a set of concluding remarks, recommendations, and potential areas of further research.

TI  - Family financial socialization, financial information seeking behavior and financial literacy among youth
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
AB  - Purpose This study examined the relationship between financial information seeking behavior and financial literacy, as well as the relationship between parents' teaching and behavior with financial information seeking behavior through the factors of the risk information seeking and processing model among youth. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 802 tertiary education students participated in this cross-sectional study. Using covariance-based structural equation modeling, the model was assessed and hypotheses were tested. Findings The results revealed that financial information seeking behavior contributed to youth's financial literacy. While parents' sound financial behavior was directly related to seeking financial information, both parents' financial teaching and behavior indirectly, through the risk information seeking process, encouraged youth to actively seek for financial information. Moreover, parents' financial socialization directly and also indirectly through the risk information seeking and processing model explained youth's financial information avoidance. Among the two parts of the risk information seeking and processing model, planned behavior factors played a more salient role than cognitive need for financial information. Originality/value This study extends the risk information seeking and processing model by integrating family financial socialization to the model and applies it in the context of consumers' financial behavior. The results improve our understanding of the social and psychological mechanism that drives consumers' financial literacy and decision-making.

TI  - Entrepreneurial Competency, Financial Literacy, and Sustainable Performance-Examining the Mediating Role of Entrepreneurial Resilience among Saudi Entrepreneurs
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This paper investigated the influence of entrepreneurial competency and financial literacy on sustainable small enterprise performance. We simultaneously investigated the mediating role of entrepreneurial resilience on the association between competence and financial literacy with sustainable business performance. We used a quantitative method for collecting data from 220 small business entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia using an online questionnaire. The collected data were analysed with the help of PLS-SEM. The results reveal that financial literacy significantly positively affects entrepreneurial competency and resilience. Entrepreneurial competency has a significant positive effect on Saudi SMEs' entrepreneurial resilience and sustainable performance. Finally, entrepreneurial resilience was simultaneously found to have a considerable impact on sustainable performance while mediating the effect of financial literacy and competency on sustainable performance across Saudi SMEs. In line with Saudi Vision 2030, with its profound focus on entrepreneurship and developing a financially independent entrepreneurial community, this research contributes to creating economic opportunities for local entrepreneurs managing small enterprises. Apart from extending the body of knowledge, this research can support policymakers in formulating relevant strategies to encourage SMEs that have been worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic to perform sustainably. Several other implications for financial institutions and entrepreneurs have also been drawn.

TI  - Testing the Influence of College Education on the Financial Literacy Level of University Students in Turkey
T2  - E-JOURNAL OF BUSINESS EDUCATION & SCHOLARSHIP OF TEACHING
AB  - This research investigates whether the undergraduate education experience in Turkey affects financial literacy (FL) levels of university students. A survey study was carried out in Suleyman Demirel University (Isparta, Turkey). Students from 7 departments under the fields of natural and applied sciences, social sciences, and health sciences were included in the study, and the participants of which were composed of first-year and senior students. The results indicate that the FL levels of the senior students are significantly higher than those of the first-year students. In addition, senior students higher FL level is also verified by the analyses performed separately for each of the fields of science. It has been determined that this difference might be affected by factors such as getting to know the concept of FL, having an investment, intensity of reading, thinking, and talking about finance, attending a financial course, employment status and having an independent income. Students who undertook a specifically FL-based course showed higher levels of FL knowledge.

TI  - The moderator effect of financial literacy on the relationship between locus of control and financial behavior
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose This study examines the effects of variables such as financial literacy and locus of control on the financial behavior of individual investors. Additionally, this article aims to reveal the moderator effect of financial literacy on locus of control and financial behavior. Design/methodology/approach Responses were collected from a questionnaire given to a convenience sample of 1,347 individual investors. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), which reveals the factor structure of the scale, was used at the beginning of the study, and then confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to confirm this new factor structure. Hypothetical relationships were examined using structural equation modeling. Findings The study provides statistical support for the validity and reliability of the scales. The statistical results of the analysis reveal that financial literacy and locus of control have a positive effect on financial behavior. Moreover, the authors prove that financial literacy changes the relationship between internal locus of control and financial behavior. In conclusion, financial literacy plays a significant role as a moderator variable that interacts with locus of control. Originality/value The findings of the research are important in demonstrating empirical evidence for the theoretical correlations. In support of the current literature, this study has confirmed the positive effects of internal locus of control and financial literacy on the financial behavior of individual investors. In addition, it has been determined that the relationship between an individual's financial behavior and internal locus of control varies according to their level of financial literacy.

TI  - Procedural and declarative cognitions Do they boost financial literacy among clients of microfinance banks in developing countries?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS AND SYSTEMS
AB  - Purpose Premised on the argument that procedural and declarative cognitions help individuals to memorize, store and recall information to make informed decisions and choices in daily life, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the auxiliary psychosomatic roles of procedural and declarative cognitions in promoting financial literacy among clients of microfinance banks in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a cross-sectional research design and a semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect responses from 400 poor households' heads located in rural Uganda. Analysis of moment structures and structural equation modeling were used to test for the auxiliary psychosomatic roles of procedural and declarative cognitions in promoting financial literacy among the poor who are clients of promotion of rural initiatives development enterprises (PRIDE) microfinance bank in rural Uganda. Findings The results revealed that both procedural and declarative cognitions significantly and positively boost financial literacy among the poor who are clients of PRIDE microfinance bank in rural Uganda. Jointly, both types of cognitions explain 30 per cent of the variation in financial literacy among the poor who are clients of PRIDE microfinance bank. Accordingly, the results correspond to arguments by psychologists that the human mental models help individuals to process, encode, store and retrieve information at an appropriate time such as in articulating complex financial information.
   Research limitations/implications - The study focused majorly on cross-sectional research design. Thus, future studies may use longitudinal research design to explore the ability of the poor to memorize and retrieve financial information over time. Additionally, the study used only quantitative data collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Further studies may use qualitative data collected by means of interviews. Besides, this study solely used poor households living in rural Uganda as the main source of data. Hence, future studies involving data from other section of the population may be necessary.
   Practical implications - The results from this study underpins the auxiliary psychosomatic roles of procedural and declarative cognitions in promoting financial literacy among clients of microfinance banks in developing countries. Indeed, the human mental models that revolve around cognition as individuals grow are critical in helping them make informed financial decisions when they are faced with difficult financial situations. Therefore, microfinance banks and financial literacy programs in developing countries should consider the roles of procedural and declarative cognitions while designing financial literacy modules. This is because they determine how individuals receive, encode, store and retrieve financial information in order to make informed and better financial decisions before consuming financial products offered by the microfinance banks.
   Originality/value At present, there is scanty extant literature and theory that explains the auxiliary psychosomatic roles of procedural and declarative cognitions in promoting financial literacy, especially in developing countries. The current study sheds more light on the deterministic roles of procedural and declarative cognitions in boosting financial literacy.

TI  - Impact of financial literacy on financial well-being: a mediational role of financial self-efficacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of financial literacy on financial well-being among the business school faculties. Both the variables (financial literacy and financial well-being) are operationalized as multi-dimensional constructs to undertake the study. Moreover, the paper also endeavored to examine the mediating role of financial self-efficacy between financial literacy and financial well-being. The paper adopts a survey by questionnaire method to gather data from 203 business school faculty members through the simple random sampling (SRS) technique. Confirmatory factor analysis was used for scale validation, and structural equation modeling was used for hypotheses testing. Mediation was tested using percentile bootstrap with a 95% confidence interval. The study found a significantly positive impact of financial literacy as well as its dimensions on financial self-efficacy and financial well-being. It was also found that financial self-efficacy partially mediates the effect of financial literacy on financial well-being. Measurement of the constructs was done on subjective measures, and the study is limited to business school faculties only. The present research findings could be employed in crafting educational programs for business schools. These programs shall guide such institutions in imparting the knowledge and skills among students regarding their personal finances in terms of savings and retirement planning. The study was focused on the business school faculties of the Jammu and Kashmir region, who are less exposed to the financial literacy programs due to factors like frequent lockdown and internet shutdowns. Moreover, it is generally witnessed that salaried class people in Jammu and Kashmir pay less attention to long-term financial planning for retirement, which makes the present study more relevant. Therefore, this study will prove beneficial to all the employees, especially the business school faculties, to understand the importance of financial literacy and its subsequent effect on financial well-being.

TI  - The Behavioral Role of Digital Economy Adaptation in Sustainable Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The basic aim of this research was to investigate the impact of the behavioral biases on financial inclusion in Pakistan while considering the moderating effect of financial literacy in this relation, in the context of behavioral perspective. This study focused on the significant behavioral phenomenon, including self-control, optimism, herding, and loss aversion with a perspective of the digital economy. To test the proposed hypothesis, the primary data collection method was used. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect data from 102 individual households through the convenience sampling technique. SmartPLS was used to analyze collected data. This study found the negative impact of self-control, optimism, and herding on financial inclusion. In contrast, loss aversion contributes to the uplift of financial inclusion in Pakistan. Similarly, financial literacy proved to have a decreasing effect on financial inclusion because of religious concerns. The moderation effect of financial literacy was also significantly positive except for loss aversion. The behavioral phenomenon proved to have a significant impact on financial inclusion. This research shows that individual households who do not use developed technological services and products from formal financial inclusion can overcome the behavioral biases that hinder them from making informed financial decisions. This research work will significantly help households use financial services to improve their standard of living and overall long-term financial well-being. This research is essential because many households are not using bank services and have low financial knowledge in Pakistan. The key contribution of this research study is that it found the relation between behavioral factors and financial inclusion. Financial literacy also has a moderating effect on their relations.

TI  - Gender differences in recollections of economic socialization, financial self-efficacy, and financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - The OECD/INFE international surveys of adult financial literacy (OECD/INFE 2016, 2020) show gender differences in financial literacy in developed countries in Europe. In this study, we examine whether these differences can be explained by gender differences in parental economic socialization using the Dutch 2018 DHS household survey. We investigate whether respondents' recollection of economic socialization when young predict their adult economic behavior and self-assessed financial knowledge. The results from ordinal logit and logistic regressions and for nonlinear equations decompositions reveal gender differences in the recollection of economic socialization and in how socialization practices are related to economic behavior and self-assessed financial knowledge. Men have to a greater degree than women been socialized in terms of having paid work outside the home, while women more often than men report that their parents controlled their spending. Moreover, we find gender differences in how men and women benefitted from the same socialization practices.

TI  - Influence of Financial Literacy and Educational Skills on Entrepreneurial Intent: Empirical Evidence from Young Entrepreneurs of Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This paper attempts to study the impact of Financial Literacy on Youth Entrepreneurial Intent in Pakistan. A closed-ended self-administered structured questionnaire covering financial literacy, computer knowledge, financial attitude, and financial knowledge with Entrepreneurial Intent was collected from young entrepreneurs. The research tried to investigate the education level with computer skill to inspect the effect of financial literateness on young generation Entrepreneurial Intent in the context of Pakistan. The research model was tested using PLS-SEM and authenticating a measurement model through the advanced methodology and their association with Entrepreneurial Intent. Results revealed that financial literacy and its two parts (financial attitude and financial knowledge) have a positive impact on Entrepreneurial Intent. The size of the joint impact of financial literacy and its components on Entrepreneurial Intent was assessed to be adequate. Entrepreneurial Intent is essential for creating new firms to maintain economic development. Furthermore, it is determined in this research that if youth has better financial knowledge and financial attitude, the probability of Entrepreneurial Intent increases. This suggests that if the youth in Pakistan desire to attain a higher limit of Entrepreneurial Intent, they must implement financial literacy models for enhancing and promoting their current Entrepreneurial Intent.

TI  - An Empirical Study on the Role of Socioeconomic Status and Demographic Factors on Financial Literacy of Engineering Students
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This research sought to investigate how financial literacy among engineering students in Uttar Pradesh, India, is influenced by socioeconomic status and demographic variables. A sum of 478 questionnaires was gathered from graduating engineers across multiple colleges and universities. IBM SPSS version 23.0 was employed for the analysis of the collected data, and chi-square techniques were utilized to examine the findings. The outcomes of the study indicated that there was no noteworthy association between gender and financial literacy among engineering students. However, caste, parents' occupation, family income, and parent's education levels demonstrated a substantial influence on the financial literacy of engineering students. Additionally, higher GPAs were correlated with increased levels of financial literacy. These results can aid in the development of focused interventions by educators and policymakers to raise engineering students' financial literacy levels. Overall, the study provides significant insights into the relationship between financial understanding, demographic variables as well as socioeconomic factors among engineering students, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to improve financial literacy levels among this population.

TI  - The Role of Financial Technology on the Nexus Between Demographic, Socio-economic, and Psychological Factors, and the Financial Literacy Gap
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - The increased accessibility and adoption of FinTech in emerging economies prompts researchers to investigate its moderating impact on the prevalent determinants of financial literacy. This research investigates the influence of demographic, socio-economic, psychological, and FinTech innovation factors on mitigating the financial literacy gap. Structured questionnaires were used to obtain primary data from the 1,100 Saudi potential participants. The descriptive and inferential statistics were computed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. The study findings revealed that FinTech innovation as a moderating variable has a limited impact on closing the financial literacy gap. Besides, marital status, income, spouse's educational background, as well as psychographic characteristics like "present financial situation,""meet monthly payments,""future is hopeless," and "don't expect change" have a bearing on the financial literacy gap. Additionally, women lacked confidence when responding to queries on financial literacy. Finally, the study concludes with implications for the policy-making bodies.

TI  - The drivers of adult financial literacy: Exploring the role of attitudes towards finance
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB  - This study investigates the factors driving the financial literacy of adult population in Spain using a regression count model (specifically the latent class Poisson model). The paper pays special attention to the effect of certain financial attitudes and financial personality traits (such as financial myopia, risk aversion, attitude to financial planning and self-perception of financial vulnerability) upon financial literacy. The results demonstrate a positive association between the financial skills, the sociodemographic characteristics and the attitudes and personality traits of individuals regarding finances. Furthermore, the analysis permits the conclusion that the effects of the financial attitudes analysed in the study vary among the different population groups, which suggests the need to adapt financial literacy promotional programs to the characteristics of the target group. Findings have implications for financial educators, practitioners and policymakers to help them recognize the proper financial program to be delivered on the basis of the FL levels and the sociodemographic composition of the individuals.

TI  - The role of financial literacy when informal caregivers make complex financial decisions
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Informal caregivers are accepting more responsibility for making financial decisions for older people with cognitive impairment. Paying for nursing home accommodation is a complex financial decision in Australia. Residents can make a lump sum payment, daily payment, or a combination of both. Due to government means-testing, the choice can impact the resident's income, assets, bequest values, and how much they pay for their aged care services. We examined the relationship between the financial literacy of informal caregivers and the accommodation payment decision. We collected data using an Australia-wide survey of informal caregivers that either made or substantially influenced the accommodation payment decision. Using the 'Big Three' questions and self-assessed financial literacy, we found that less than half of respondents were financially literate. Greater financial literacy was significantly associated with reduced decision complexity and greater decision certainty, but this relationship was moderated by nursing home behaviour and perceived time available for decision-making. Whether a nursing home suggested consulting a financial adviser, expressed a payment type preference or informed caregivers about their decision-making time period, predicted financial adviser use and the perceived complexity and certainty of decision-making.

TI  - Investigating the Moderating Roles of Basic and Advanced Financial Literacy between Behavioural Biases and Stock Buying Decisions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORGANISATIONAL STUDIES AND INNOVATION
AB  - This empirical research investigates whether investors in Pakistan Stock Exchange are influenced by a set of behavioural biases while making stock buying decisions. Subsequently, this study evaluates as to what extent active stock investors are financially literate at basic and advanced level and test whether basic and advanced financial literacy moderate the effects of behavioural biases on stock buying decisions. Five-point Likert scale has been used to measure the reflective constructs of behavioural biases and stock buying decisions. Sample size of 326 respondents from Karachi and Hyderabad cities in Pakistan has been used, employing convenience sampling, to analyze the data using descriptive statistics and Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling. Out of seven biases tested, Anchoring and Adjustment bias is found to have negative significant effect on stock buying decisions while Herd Mentality bias and Availability bias are found to have significant positive effect on stock buying decisions. Active stock investors were found to have high level of basic financial literacy whereas advanced financial literacy was present at a moderate level. Basic financial literacy moderates the association between herd mentality bias and stock buying decisions while advanced financial literacy moderates the relationship between mental accounting bias and stock buying decisions.

TI  - Impact of religiosity and branding on SMEs performance: does financial literacy play a role?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING
AB  - Purpose This study aims to examine the relationship between religiosity and branding on small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs') performance in Saudi Arabia. It also examines the mediating role of financial literacy on the relationship among Islamic religiosity, branding and SMEs' performance.
   Design/methodology/approach This study adopts the purposive sampling technique in three major commercial cities, namely, Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Qassim to sample 100 SMEs each, resulting in a total sampling of 300 SMEs in Saudi Arabia. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze the hypotheses formulated in this study. The structural equation modeling is aided with the help of Smart-PLS software.
   Findings This study finds that Islamic branding (on customer, compliance and origin) significantly affect financial attitude, while Islamic religiosity affects financial awareness among the SMEs. Findings reveal that there is a mediating role of financial awareness on the relationship between Islamic branding and Islamic religiosity with the SMEs' performance. No mediation effect was recorded for financial attitude and financial knowledge. Further investigation reveals that financial attitude, financial awareness, Islamic branding (compliance and origin) and Islamic religiosity were the most significant determinants of SMEs' performance in the context of Saudi Arabia.
   Research limitations/implications This study is conducted on SMEs in Saudi Arabia only. Further studies are required to examine SMEs in other Islamic countries and regions to improve the explanatory power of financial literacy on Islamic religiosity and Islamic branding for improved SMEs performance.
   Originality/value This study establishes that Islamic religiosity and branding could further increase the predictive power of financial literacy on SMEs' performance. This study concludes that efforts to improve financial literacy should be religion-based as well as culture-based depending on where the SMEs are located so that specific strategies can be implemented, to enable the conducive growth of the SMEs and maximize the contribution of the SMEs to economic growth.

TI  - How Does Technological and Financial Literacy Influence SME Performance: Mediating Role of ERM Practices
T2  - INFORMATION
AB  - The knowledge-based view (KBV) in the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is a debatable topic in the current literature. Although convergence of technological and financial literacy (techno-finance literacy) is an essential knowledge-based tool to address rapid digitalization of business, the influence of techno-finance literacy in the development of SMEs is still not adequately researched. Drawing upon KBV, we developed a single-mediator structural model with an aim to explore the effect of techno-finance literacy and enterprise risk management (ERM) practices (applications) on the performance of SMEs. A self-administered structured questionnaire was employed to collect data from 319 chief financial offers (CFOs) in Sri Lankan SMEs. The outcome of our study highlights that techno-finance literacy is a significant determinant of two endogenous constructs, namely, SME performance and ERM practices. Furthermore, ERM practices of SMEs were also positively affected to the SME performance. Moreover, ERM practices were observed to have a partial mediation on the relationship between financial literacy and SME performance. These findings form the basis for theories in techno-finance literacy and SME performance, as well as present managerial implications to enhance the performance of SMEs.

TI  - Financial inclusion as mediator in the relationship of social capital and financial literacy towards business performance of the trade sector SMEs in Pekanbaru, Indonesia
T2  - ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI
AB  - This study analyzes SMEs' performance problems in the trade sector in Pekanbaru by using several internal company factors to build a competitive strategy till the year 2021. The variables used in this study consisted of social capital, financial literacy, financial inclusion, and business performance. The study used 300 SMEs consisting of 26 wholesalers and 274 retailers in Pekanbaru, Riau. We used a structural equation model (SEM) approach with AMOS for hypothesis testing. The results show that social capital and financial literacy have a significant direct effect on the SME businesses' performance in the trade sector in Pekanbaru. This shows that social capital and financial literacy are two determining factors for the success of SME businesses. However, social capital does not affect business performance indirectly through the role of financial inclusion.

TI  - Developing a Financial Literacy Storybook for Early Childhood in an Augmented Reality Context
T2  - CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB  - This study aims to develop and test the effectiveness of a financial literacy storybook based on augmented reality (AR) as an executive function-building intervention for early-age children. Executive functions are the cognitive abilities underlying such tasks as focusing on long-term goals, delaying gratification and impulse self-control. The method is research and development using the ADDIE (analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation) model. This learning media produced a positive response among the users. Children perceive the story's attractiveness was good, while the 3D images and activity in the storybook were very good. This study also measures the effectiveness of a storybook based on AR in improving the understanding of financial literacy using a pre and post-test design. The results show that knowledge of honesty, discipline and money management increased significantly. In addition, there is a marginally significant increase in the aspects of delay gratification, saving goals and responsibility.

TI  - Financial literacy and household energy efficiency: An analysis of credit market and supply chain
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - We use survey data from China households to investigate the impact of financial literacy on household energy efficiency. We aggregate the household energy use and carbon emissions after calculating the energy and carbon intensity of the related sectors of household expenditure. We show that households with high financial literacy perform higher energy use and carbon emissions but lower energy efficiency. Furthermore, the credit market and supply chain have statistically positive effects on energy use and carbon emissions. The results suggest that the government should take more decisive action to reduce carbon emissions, not rely on households voluntarily.

TI  - Financial Literacy on High School Students. How is Their Performance if Study and Work?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The aim of the study is to analyze the financial knowledge of high school students in Mexico; its relationship with the student's age, gender, and condition of studying and working. The study is a non-experimental quantitative, descriptive, exploratory, and correlational cross-sectional study. Through a non-probabilistic sampling by self-determination, the total participants were 423 students enrolled in three institutions of Higher Education, all belonging to the state of Oaxaca. For the application of the instrument, we had the support of some teachers to share a link to Google forms. In order to determine the relationship between financial literacy (FL) and other sociodemographic variables (gender, age, and employment status), a dichotomous Probit model is used. The results show low financial literacy of the students, who only a fifth understand the concepts of compound interest, inflation, and diversification; no gender difference was identified in this age group. The significant effect of the interaction variable (gender and condition of studying and working) on the probability of understanding the effect of inflation on purchasing power is evident. Therefore, the results obtained can contribute to the design of financial education (FE) programs for young people at an early age that allows them to make informed financial decisions in any aspect of their personal and work life.

TI  - TALC: the role of TMM on loyalty intention and financial literacy as confounding variable in destination rejuvenation stage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM CITIES
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to examine the role of the tourism marketing mix (TMM) and the perceived quality of tourism services on tourist satisfaction and loyalty intention in marine tourism in East Java, i.e. beaches. In addition, this study also examines the impact of financial literacy on loyalty intention.Design/methodology/approachThe sample consists of 320 tourists who were visiting the beach. Data was collected using the accidental sampling technique. Moderated structural equation modelling (MSEM) was registered as the analytical tool used in this study.FindingsThe results of the study show that the innovation and renovation carried out on beach tourism during the rejuvenation stage had an impact on increasing tourist visits. The TMM and the perceived quality of tourism services provided significantly increased tourist satisfaction and loyalty intention. In addition, financial literacy is found to be an important factor in promoting tourists' loyalty intention.Research limitations/implicationsAs mentioned in the conclusion, there are just a dim number of prior research that are able to back up the argument of the role of financial literacy in instigating suboptimal financial behaviour and performance in the context of tourism behaviour, especially highlighting the loyalty intention. Not to mention that prior research is not specifically intended in the tourism field, which makes it hard to extend the argument while structuring the literature review and developing the hypothesis.Originality/valueThis study is mainly important due to its emphasis on financial literacy on its role in promoting tourists' loyalty intentions, as it found that financial literacy holds a critical role while there is barely any existing literature that focuses on this topic.

TI  - Exploring the impact of financial literacy on predicting credit default among farmers: An analysis using a hybrid machine learning model
T2  - BORSA ISTANBUL REVIEW
AB  - This study explores whether financial literacy can enhance the ability to predict credit default by farmers using machine-learning models. It introduces a hybrid model combining k-means clustering and Adaboost to predict loan default using data on 10,396 farmers who obtained credit from Chinese rural commercial banks, including demographics, household finance, credit history, and financial literacy. We systemically compare the results of models with and without financial literacy variables, which indicate significant improvement in the predictive accuracy about credit risk when financial literacy factors are included. Our findings confirm that financial literacy is a crucial indicator of farmers' ability to make informed financial decisions, reducing their likelihood of loan default and suggesting its utility as a screening tool or supplementary credit risk assessment variable. This research has profound implications for financial inclusion and credit risk management, indicating that financial institutions can leverage financial literacy data to evaluate farmers' creditworthiness and design effective financial education programs. This study enriches the literature on credit risk prediction by introducing financial literacy as a predictor of credit default.

TI  - The impact of financial literacy and financial behavior in entrepreneurial motivation - evidence from Indonesia
T2  - COGENT EDUCATION
AB  - Entrepreneurship has been viewed as a catalyst for economic growth because it creates jobs and offers solutions to social issues. The government is trying to make entrepreneurship popularized among the public, especially in students in universities. This analysis aims to ascertain how financial behavior and literacy, particularly among accounting students who are the sample of this study at West Java universities, affect entrepreneurial motivation. In addition, this research also examined the level of financial literacy and the level of financial behavior in accounting students in West Java, Indonesia. This research employs a quantitative approach and the data were collected using a survey questionnaire. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) method were used to analyze data of 252 respondents of accounting students from universities in West Java, Indonesia. The study discovered a significant positive association between financial literacy and accounting students' financial behavior and their willingness to start their own business. The research also assessed the degree of financial literacy and financial behavior among participants who achieved a relatively strong overall outcome, along with the level of drive for entrepreneurship among respondents with a similarly elevated average performance. This research contributes to educators and educational institutions that it is very important to design an integrated educational curriculum to strengthen the entrepreneurial motivation of accounting students who are the sample of this study at West Java universities in Indonesia.

T2  - FUTURE BUSINESS JOURNAL
AB  - This study examines the interlinkages between financial literacy, economic freedom, government quality, and financial inclusion using cross-sectional and panel data analysis. Using a sample of 98 countries from the year 2007 to 2018, OLS and system GMM estimators were used to analyze the results. The estimation results indicate that financial literacy and government quality positively influence financial inclusion. Results also find that governance quality strengthens the effect of financial literacy on financial inclusion. The results derived from the dynamic panel model also reasonably conclude the positive effect of economic freedom on financial inclusion while government quality acts as a catalyst for their link. Our results are also robust to sub-panels based on the level of country risk.

TI  - An item response theory approach to constructing and evaluating brief and in-depth financial literacy scales
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - We applied item response theory (IRT) to construct and evaluate new brief and in-depth financial literacy scales. A survey of a UK adult sample (N= 589) included 50 questions to assess knowledge about managing financial resources and competence in using personal finance-related information-including five widely used items, on interest rates, inflation, investment diversification, mortgages and bonds. IRT applied to a scale of these items identified some limitations, overcome via further iterations to construct a new brief scale with sound psychometric properties. IRT was then applied iteratively to our pool, resulting in an in-depth, 20-item scale, also psychometrically sound, covering four broad financial domains: everyday money transactions; the concept of money; borrowing; and saving and investment. Parallel 10-item sub-scales were also evaluated. The validity of the new scales was demonstrated by regression analyses which found that, controlling for demographic variables, financial literacy predicted key indicators of financial well-being.

TI  - Analyzing the Effects of Financial Education on Financial Literacy and Financial Behaviour: A Randomized Field Experiment in Croatia
T2  - SOUTH EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - In this paper, we examined the financial attitude and financial behavior of students and determined their level of financial literacy through a survey. We found that female students report less interest in finance, have less confidence in their financial abilities, and have a lower financial literacy score than male students. On average, we can conclude that students have a low level of financial literacy. In this study we found factors that influence financial literacy which are age, student's GPA, whether they already took some form of personal finance course, a proxy for numeracy, and place of birth in terms of a capital city. Furthermore, based on controlled experimental field research, we conducted financial training, and investigated causal evidence of the effectiveness of financial education. A training intervention to increase financial literacy was effective and improved financial attitude but increasing financial literacy through means of education was insufficient for making better financial decisions since students did not report a lower frequency of impulsive buying or a higher hypothetical savings rate. We found no evidence that female students were affected by this training any differently than male students.

TI  - Knowing the "Don't Knows" to Financial Literacy Questions in the U.S. National Financial Capability Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This study examines the propensity of responding "don't know" (DK) to a set of financial literacy questions given the opportunity to respond correctly, incorrectly, or DK, the inclusion of a DK response item uniquely encompasses facets of financial literacy, which are often overlooked. While researchers utilizing the NFCS have historically treated these responses as incorrect in financial literacy assessments or excluded/dropped DK responses in empirical analyses, this studys' findings suggest that the interpretation of DK responses may be better viewed as an amalgamation of survey participants' uncertainty, response confidence, ambiguity regarding the question, or unwillingness to respond, rather than an outright lack of financial literacy. The empirical results suggest that females and those without financially independent children tend to respond DK more frequently to the financial literacy questions examined and that those who are older, married, highly educated, retired, have higher incomes, and current and former military personnel tend to select DK less frequently. Compared to Whites, Blacks are more likely and Asian/Pacific Islanders are less likely to answer DK.

TI  - How financial literacy and impatience shape retirement wealth and investment behaviors
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Two competing explanations for why consumers have trouble with financial decisions are gaining momentum. One is that people are financially illiterate since they lack understanding of simple economic concepts and cannot carry out computations such as computing compound interest, which could cause them to make suboptimal financial decisions. A second is that impatience or present-bias might explain suboptimal financial decisions. That is, some people persistently choose immediate gratification instead of taking advantage of larger long-term payoffs. We use experimental evidence from Chile to explore how these factors appear related to poor financial decisions. Our results show that our measure of impatience is a strong predictor of wealth and investment in health. Financial literacy is also correlated with wealth though it appears to be a weaker predictor of sensitivity to framing in investment decisions. Policymakers interested in enhancing retirement well-being would do well to consider the importance of both factors.

T2  - HELIYON
AB  - The ability to manage money has been identified as a vital talent. In this context, financial literacy has a role to play. There are significant gaps, though, such as the financial connection to human behavior. The purpose of this study is to look at the overall effects of financial literacy (FL) on the behavioural aspects of materialism (ML), compulsive buying (CB), and tendency to debt (TD). It attempts to develop and evaluate a model that is based on these variables and to examine the relationships between these research constructs. The study looked at 233 respondents mainly students studying in Omani universities. A comprehensive literature review, confirmatory factorial analysis, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), and comprehensive analysis were used to develop research hypotheses. The primary findings suggested that financial literacy had the most significant impact on compulsive purchasing behaviour in comparison to materialism and the propensity to accumulate debt, among the direct relationships that were suggested. The study's findings have important implications for the formulation of public policy and other interested parties, as financial literacy is advantageous for individuals with poor financial health and facilitates the participation in other psychological behaviours.

TI  - Saving Habits of High-School Students Associated with Their Future Retirement As Financial Literacy Topics
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - A wide variety of studies have pointed to the relevance of saving at an early age and how an adequate financial culture can generate efficient resource management, meeting the needs of the individual in the future during his or her old age. Derived from this reflection, the purpose of this study is to describe the current state of financial literacy presented by high school students in the Mexican Southeast and how this impacts their retirement savings habits. A non-probabilistic sample of 343 students was analyzed and a test designed by BANAMEX-UNAM (2008) was used to evaluate saving topics, knowledge about retirement, budgets, habits about the use and origin of their resources. Among the most important findings highlights that, in very few cases, savings refer to future projections and a large part of the population analyzed is unaware of basic concepts such as retirement age and institutions for retirement. In addition, evidence was obtained indicating that there is no dependence between gender and information on pensions, in terms of having heard about pensions, understanding pensions and knowing the institution and the age of retirement. Finally, we suggest to carry out a research to compare the level of financial literacy in young Mexicans and its relationship with parental banking, preferably in the southeast and other regions of Mexico.

TI  - Can problem-solving attitudes explain the gender gap in financial literacy? Evidence from Italian students' data
T2  - QUALITY & QUANTITY
AB  - Recent results from the OECD PISA (Financial literacy assessment framework. Australian Council for Educational Research. ACER, Australia, 2012) highlight that Italy is the only surveyed country where, among 15-year-old students, boys perform significantly better than girls in terms of financial literacy. This gap is relevant because financially literacy is crucial to make sound financial decisions and, consequently, it is likely to impact strongly on well-being of women. The main findings reveal that students' performance in financial literacy is most strongly influenced by some personality traits, such as perseverance and openness to solving complex problems, and, at same time, by the school career and the type of school attended. Their effects are larger among low-performing students than in the upper tail of the score distribution. A decomposition exercise of the gender gap in financial literacy confirms the role played by motivational and attitudinal factors and, at the same time, highlights that putting males and females on an even footing with respect to personal characteristics does not suffice to close the gap.

TI  - Association of Financial Attitude, Financial Behaviour and Financial Knowledge Towards Financial Literacy: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach
T2  - FIIB BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Financial literacy is an ability of individual to take considerable decisions in respect of the effective and efficient utilization of money. In present study, authors have presented an association of financial knowledge, financial behaviour and financial attitude towards the financial literacy level among working women in Delhi, India. The sample size of 394 working women from various public and private organizations of Delhi has been incorporated for the research. A structured questionnaire designed on a 5-point Likert scale has been used based on purposive sampling, and the goodness of fit is determined by analysis of moments structures (AMOS) by applying structural equation modeling approach (SEM). The association between three independent variables is investigated applying path analysis for hypothesis testing. The findings revealed that financial attitude and financial behaviour have strong association with financial literacy of working women than financial knowledge.

TI  - Is financial advice a cure-all or the icing on the cake for financial literacy? Evidence from financial market participation in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - We examine how financial advice interacts with financial literacy to shape household decisions on stock market participation in China. Particularly, we investigate how the effect of financial advice varies with economic expectations, preferences for asset diversification and the level of financial literacy. Feeding the data of 5274 households into a Probit model that predicts the probability of holding stocks, we find that, while an increase in financial literacy significantly raises the stock market participation of all households, seeking financial advice only increases the participation for those households which have a preference for asset diversification or which have an optimistic expectation about the economy. Moreover, the effect of financial advice is concentrated on households with high financial literacy, implying that an insufficient level of financial literacy is the reason for the poor performance of financial advice in China. We also examine if there are influential trust or quality concerns which would reduce the effectiveness of financial advice but we find no significant evidence for it.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Credit Accessibility of Rice Farmers in Pakistan: Analysis for Central Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Regions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study investigates the factors that affect farmers' access to Food Security and Agricultural Credit (FSAC) services for the farmers of Pakistan who have no access to banking but have a feasible farm business. Using multiple regressions and logistic analysis, the authors revealed the determinants of farmers' financial literacy and analyzed the variables which affected the farmers' accessibility to FSAC. Results indicated that the average financial literacy of respondents was at a moderate level. It was affected by the age of respondents, length of their education, distance to nearby cities, ownership of bank accounts, annual income, and financial education experience. The FSAC accessibility was also impacted by the area of cultivated land, interest rate, collateral, farms' income, financial literacy index, credit accessibility experiences, the legal status of farmer groups, and the amount of a loan. Some of the issues that prevent farmers from having widespread access to the FSAC include the lack of loan need, lack of FSAC awareness, lack of collateral, loan usury perspective, loan rejection experience, fear of borrowing from the bank, and inactive farmer groups. The study contributes to the existing literature on the determinants of farmers' access and choice of credit sources by using a primary data set.

TI  - Financial Literacy and IPO Underpricing
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
AB  - Using an international sample of IPO firms and two country-level measures of financial literacy, we find strong evidence that financial literacy is negatively associated with IPO underpricing. In cross-sectional analyses, we find that the effect of financial literacy in reducing IPO underpricing is more pronounced when the information environment is less transparent. Employing path analysis, we document that information friction, firm transparency, and stock market participation are mechanisms that mediate this relationship. Our study contributes to and extends the literature by providing strong evidence that citizens' financial literacy has an important and consistent influence on IPO underpricing.

TI  - Financial literacy and quality of life of consumers faced with cancer: a moderated mediation approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether financial distress explains the relationship between financial literacy and quality of life (QoL) among consumers who have faced life-threatening cancer. To extend this line of research, the moderating role of social supports in the relationship between financial distress and QoL is examined.
   Design/methodology/approach - Across-sectional survey was utilized to collect quantitative data through a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 223 consumers diagnosed with cancer in Iran participated in the study by means of a convenience sampling technique. Using a forward-backward method the questionnaire was translated from English into Persian.
   Findings - The findings highlight the importance of financial literacy in managing direct and indirect costs of chronic diseases that in turn can improve consumers' QoL. Moreover, while perceived social support improves QoL of consumers diagnosed with cancer, it strengthens the negative association between financial distress and QoL. Consequently, solely receiving of emotional support from acquaintances with no financial support might be bothersome.
   Practical implications - The findings highlight the need for interventions that target financial literacy and perceived financial distress for consumers with chronic diseases. These consumers can benefit from interventions that offer support based on accurate assessments of their needs and priorities.
   Originality/value - The present study is the first of its kind to highlight the importance of financial literacy in improving the QoL of consumers with chronic diseases.

TI  - Digital adoption, business performance, and financial literacy in ultra-micro, micro, and small enterprises in Indonesia
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - This study investigates the factors affecting digital adoption by ultra-micro, micro, and small enterprises (UMSEs) based on a survey of 5035 UMSEs in 17 major provinces in Indonesia. We use the survey data to construct a digital adoption index to evaluate the variations in digital adoption in the five business processes of e-procurement, POS, e -marketing, e-commerce, and digital payment. This index not only identifies whether a firm has adopted digital technology but also considers the dimensions of use to measure the level of adoption more precisely. Using the primary data, we employ a simple regression model, and the results demonstrate that owner demographic characteristics, firm-specific factors, business environment, connectivity infrastructure quality, and culture are associated with disparities in digital adoption by UMSEs. Our findings also reveal a positive and significant correlation between digital adoption on business performance. Based on a two-stage least squares (2SLS) model, we found strong evidence of the impact of digital adoption on UMSE owners ' level of financial literacy. The latter result suggests that improving digital adoption among UMSEs could enhance their financial literacy. Overall, these findings confirm the vital role of digital transformation for UMSEs to achieve growth and competitiveness in the global market, which requires robust support from policymakers.

TI  - Relationship between an inconsistent degree of financial literacy and inconsistent decision-making in intertemporal choices
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Intertemporal choice refers to the decision-making process involving trade-offs between rewards available at different points in time (such as choosing between smaller immediate rewards versus larger rewards later on). Empirical evidence often deviates from the exponential preferences predicted by the normative model. A hyperbolic discount function better mirrors individual behavior, explaining temporal inconsistency - whereby preferences vary over time by applying a higher discount in the present. Hyperbolic preferences are associated with addictive behaviors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, as well as depression or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Established measures in the literature quantify the extent of deviation from exponential trend exhibited by hyperbolic preferences. In addition to behavioral and cognitive factors, it is essential to incorporate financial literacy into the examination of individual decision-making behaviors. The present study analyzes the relationship between the degree of decision-making inconsistency and the degree of financial literacy inconsistency across three dimensions: knowledge, behavior, and attitudes. It aims to illustrate while financial literacy is important, it is not sufficient to ensure rational choices. Rather, it reveals a strong correlation among its dimensions. The results of this research could be included when creating investor profiles required by MiFID, considering insights from behavioral finance studies in these profiles. What is more, understanding psychological biases that can influence financial decision-making empowers investors to make more informed decisions and avoid common pitfalls.

TI  - Supporting SMEs Financial Resilience during Crises: A Framework to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Financial Literacy Programs Targeting SMEs
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - Financing capital investments and working capital have been the key challenges for small businesses during and in the aftermath of the pandemic. Excessive indebtedness can increase the fragility of firms, particularly during times of uncertainty. While there are several programs globally that target entrepreneurs' financial literacy, most of them do not take into consideration entrepreneurs' financial resilience during and after crisis times such as pandemics. The objective of this paper is to discuss the status of financial literacy programs targeting entrepreneurs. This paper conducts a review of the relevant literature to establish the initial understanding and then generates a framework consisting of entrepreneurs' financial literacy along with its components. This is done by carrying out qualitative content analysis of the various financial literacy initiatives targeting entrepreneurs in twenty countries globally to understand their target segments, scope, initiating organisations and limitations. The paper then suggests a framework for entrepreneurs' financial education that takes into consideration financial resilience during and after crisis situations in general and pandemics in particular.

TI  - Enhancing Islamic financial literacy through community-based workshops: a transtheoretical model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose This study aims to propose a comprehensive education model to enhance Islamic financial literacy to elevate the prominence of Islamic finance. Design/methodology/approach The study conceptualized a framework of Islamic finance education using Prochaska and DiClemente's transtheoretical model (TTM) of change aided by a review of the essential literature on Islamic financial literacy. The study also includes critical reflection based on the real firsthand experiences of delivering 16 voluntary non-formal community-based Islamic finance workshops for Indonesian diaspora in the UK and the Republic of Ireland from December 2014 to July 2016. Findings This study provides an inclusive conceptualization of an Islamic finance education approach to creating awareness in communities of applying Islamic financial principles in daily life. It also elaborates stage-appropriate strategies that cover the pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance stages that vary by upon individuals based on their readiness to adopt Islamic finance principles. Research limitations/implications This study is not merely based on a conceptual examination of literature but also incorporates critical reflection on a series of community-based Islamic finance workshops conducted by the authors. It therefore offers the potential to present an under-researched model used to enhance Islamic finance literacy as one of the pillars in supporting the development of the Islamic economic and financial sector. Practical implications This study provides guidelines and various practical ideas that scholars and any concerned parties can use to offer community-based Islamic finance educational activities aimed at supporting the future organic growth of Islamic finance. Originality/value The study expands the use of Prochaska and DiClemente's TTM (which has been widely cited in health-related behavioral research) and brings a unique theoretical lens, notably within the Islamic finance literature. The use of the TTM was established in psychology and health-related behavioral science, particularly in relation to elucidating how people cease unhealthy behaviors (e.g. alcohol and smoking addictions) and how they develop healthy behaviors. This paper brings the TTM into another context on how to stimulate individuals, particularly Muslims, to shift from "riba addiction" and develop sharia-compliant financial behaviors.

TI  - Validating the Financial Literacy Index of Hungarian SMEs during the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian War
T2  - RISKS
AB  - The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian war have had a significant impact on economies around the world, with pivotal implications for the activities of companies. The issue of corporate financial literacy has been within our scope of interest for a matter of years now, and this study aims at re-enforcing our previous overall theoretical and literacy-based analysis from a methodological approach. We use our own previous databases to explore and analyze the importance of corporate financial literacy, taking into account the economic factors inside and outside the organization that affect the businesses. For this, a confirmative factor analysis (CFA) model has been created. The article aims at two things with this. On the one hand, we intend to introduce the wider scope of the fit tests applicable in the CFA, thus giving a direction to other authors. It also allows for adequate verification for their models, while at the same time conducting the fit test for our corporate financial literacy model as well as a valid model framework suitable for making measurements and deductions. With the resulting model, this paper aims to examine the corporate financial literacy, the current economic challenges, and the issues faced by managers during crises. In addition to all this, with our article, we also want to make some contribution to the methodology of empirical data analysis: in the article we collect the fit tests that can be used to validate confirmatory factor models, the way they are determined, and most importantly, we try to sort out the literature approaches to the acceptable values of these tests, giving the reader a kind of guide and a reference base. The results of the research identify response measures that can contribute to increasing companies' resilience based on the principles of financial awareness.

TI  - The forms of financial literacy overconfidence and their role in financial well-being
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Overconfidence in financial literacy (FL) is defined and assessed in various ways, and results regarding the effects of FL overconfidence on financial well-being are inconsistent. Therefore, this study aims to develop our understanding of the processes by which overconfidence in FL influences the financial well-being of consumers; that is to separately examine the effects of the different forms of FL overconfidence on financial well-being. In order to map the associations between FL, the forms of FL overconfidence, and financial well-being, the data of 506 randomly selected Hungarian test-takers were collected by a self-report questionnaire. According to the results, FL and its overestimation (OE) are positively linked to households' financial outcomes. Hence, perceived FL is a better predictor of financial well-being than actual FL skills. Moreover, the results add to the existing body of literature by showing that the effects of the different forms of overconfidence are divergent: overprecision and OE may be damaging. Thus, the paper provides evidence that FL overconfidence is a multifaceted construct, and its different forms affect financial well-being differently.

TI  - Does SME's financing decisions follow pecking order pattern? The role of financial literacy, risk preference, and home bias in SME financing decisions
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper aims to explore the role of financial literacy, risk preference, and home bias in Minangkabau ethnic SME financing decisions, and whether their financing pattern follow the pecking order theory. The theoretical framework model was developed to determine the impact of financial literacy, risk preference, and home bias on the financing decisions of SMEs. The study applied the SEM-PLS method in testing the model. Data collection was carried out through online and offline survey techniques with a sample of 623 SMEs. The results reveal that home bias and risk preference have a negative direct effect on financing decision. Home bias also has a direct positive influence on risk preference. Financial literacy can minimize home bias from negative to positive toward financing decision. However, financial literacy does not have a direct effect on the financing decisions and does not have a significant direct influence on risk preference. Most SMEs have a low level of financial literacy, a high tendency for home bias and a high-risk preference. Financial literacy has strong positive moderation effect on the influence of home bias toward financing decision. Home bias make SME financing decision does not follow pecking order pattern. As SMEs financial literacy level is still very low, thus it is important for financial institutions to educate SMEs by providing several trainings about financial matters. The findings suggest to improve the financial literacy of SMEs informal association groups in order to help them reducing their home bias tendency. This study seeks to explore the pecking order pattern in financing decisions of SMEs.

TI  - Financial literacy, access to finance, SMEs performance and Islamic religiosity: evidence from Saudi Arabia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP & SMALL BUSINESS
AB  - This paper seeks to explore the impact of access to finance and financial literacy on the SMEs performance in an Islamic context. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design by employing 255 SMEs in Saudi Arabia. The findings showed a positive mediating effect of access to finance on the relationship between financial awareness, financial attitude and SMEs performance while access to finance does not mediate the nexus between financial knowledge and SMEs performance. Subsequently, the findings revealed that access to finance have positive effect on SMEs performance. This study also found that access to finance increases the positive relationship between financial literacy and SMEs performance. The role of religiosity was found to positively increase access to finance towards affecting SMEs performance. The findings of this study provide SMEs with the knowledge to increase their religious practices to access government Islamic funds, i.e., Mudarabah and Musharakah while Islamic banking firms should increase their Islamic products and services to attract SMEs in Saudi Arabia.

TI  - Financial literacy of high school students in the Netherlands: knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION
AB  - We examined levels of financial literacy (knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and self-reported behavior) among 15-year-old high school students in the Netherlands (N= 2025), and investigated which factors are associated with the different financial literacy components. Our findings show lower levels of financial literacy among students in the lowest track in high school, students with low mathematical ability, immigrant students, students with low SES, students with mothers without a university degree, and students who do not discuss financial matters with family and peers. Notably, our findings show a large gap in financial knowledge levels between the lowest and highest high-school tracks in the Netherlands. These findings are useful for designing effective financial education and intervention programs, and for identifying groups that may benefit the most from financial education programs.

TI  - Understanding financial literacy and associated factors among adult population in a low-middle income country
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - This study aims to identify whether demographics, socio-economic factors, the usage of the internet, smartphone and bank, and cultural factor affect Vietnamese adults' financial literacy. A sample of 669 participants participated in the online survey questionnaire (response rate of 89.92%). Multivariate general linear model regression shows that adults of younger age have better skills in cash management, credit management, savings and investment, and financial management compared to older adults. The findings suggest that participants with better income could manage savings and overall finance more effectively. Furthermore, respondents with "Uncertain avoidance" in the culture had better skills in cash management, saving, and investment. Meanwhile, preferring masculinity had higher scores in credit management, insurance, and total scale compared to those preferring femininity. The significant contribution of this study is its usefulness for economic players to have assertive financial strategies and policymakers to enhance the level of financial literacy and provide trustworthy financial guidance.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This study examines the relationship between financial behavior, financial literacy, self-efficacy, and self-coping among emerging adults. The study population is 790 respondents from 11 Credit Counselling and Debt Management (CCDM). Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) was used to analyze Pearson Correlation and Multiple regression. It was used to determine the relationships and recognize determinants of emerging adults' financial behavior respectively. In this study, financial literacy, self-efficacy, self-coping, and financial behavior variables were entered into the regression. A total of 790 respondents aged 40 and below were selected. An independent sample t-test was administered to compare the financial behavior scores for females and males. The results reveal that there was significant difference in the mean of financial behavior scores for females (M = 87.20, SD = 18.00) and males (M = 89.70, SD = 16.80; t (765) = 2.010, p = 0.045, two-tailed). The multiple regression results indicate that the model explained 13.4% of the variance in financial behavior, which is predicted significantly by the model (F = 38.361, p = 0.000). This study will be beneficial to policymakers to improve living conditions and to promote good financial behavior, financial literacy, self-efficacy as well as self-coping especially for emerging adults in Malaysia.

TI  - An Untapped Instrument in the Fight Against Poverty: The Impacts of Financial Literacy on Poverty Worldwide
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - The World Bank assessed that meeting the goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 appears to be challenging (or even impossible) for the world. This observation requires an urgent need for policymakers to explore potent instruments to combat poverty globally. Numerous studies have examined various determinants of poverty. However, financial literacy-a relatively new concept-remains underexplored, especially on a global scale. As such, this study is conducted to assess whether financial literacy can reduce the likelihood of falling into poverty using a unique dataset of 113 countries. We find that financial literacy has a significant and negative association with the likelihood of falling into poverty. Beyond association, the causal analysis shows that financial literacy exerts a negative effect on poverty. Our findings remain largely unchanged across different sub-samples based on socio-demographic factors, regions and country income levels, and robustness analyses.

TI  - Gender Differences in Financial Literacy and Financial Behaviour Among Young Adults: The Role of Parents and Information Seeking
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - This research aimed to examine the impact of gender on the mechanism that translates family financial socialisation to financial literacy and behaviour among Malaysian young adults and also to examine the role of financial information-seeking behaviour and its antecedents in this mechanism. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken. A total of 572 young Malaysian adults from four major universities participated in the study. The results revealed that both parents' teaching and behaviour directly inform young adults' financial behaviour. However, among females, parents' teaching through planned behaviour drove their financial information-seeking behaviour, which in turn informed their financial literacy. Contrary to popular notions, financial literacy had no influence on financial behaviour. Moreover, a negative relationship between parental teaching and financial literacy among males was found.

TI  - Digital financial literacy, current behavior of saving and spending and its future foresight
T2  - ECONOMICS OF INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGY
AB  - This paper investigates the relationship among digital financial literacy (DFL), current saving behavior, current spending behavior, and foresight of future spending and saving behavior among Indonesian millennials. This research uses structural equation modeling to estimate the relationship among the variables. The research surveyed millennials in the 25-40 age group in several urban areas of Java island. The survey collected information of the indicators constructing the latent variables. The results indicate that DFL is influenced by social-economic standing. DFL also positively affects the current saving and spending behavior. Moreover, the current saving and spending behavior contribute to the future saving and spending foresight. This research suggests policymaker to provide knowledge about DFL to the millennials.

TI  - Nexus between financial literacy and financial inclusion Examining the moderating role of cognition from a developing country perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - Premised on the argument that cognition structures the way how individuals think and make decisions, the purpose of this paper is to test the interaction effect of cognition in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study used cross-sectional research design and quantitative data were collected and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Baron and Kenny guidelines were adopted to test for existence of moderating effect of cognition in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Furthermore, ModGraph excel software was used to establish the magnitude of moderating effect of cognition in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda.
   Findings - The results revealed that cognition significantly moderate the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. In addition, both cognition and financial literacy also have direct effects on financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda.
   Research limitations/implications - The study adopted cross-sectional research design and data were collected by use of only questionnaires. Future studies through longitudinal research design may be employed. Besides, further studies using interviews may be adopted. Furthermore, this study collected data from only tier 3 financial institutions, thus, ignoring the other financial institutions. Future studies could focus on financial institutions under the other tiers.
   Practical implications - The findings from the study enlightens policy-makers, managers of financial institutions, and financial inclusion advocates on the importance of cognition in enhancing financial literacy among the poor, especially in rural Uganda. Cognition combined with financial literacy helps the poor to make wise financial decisions and choices toward consuming financial services and products provided by formal financial institutions. This leads to increased scope of financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Therefore, advocates of financial literacy should assess community cultural cognition and utilize them to design and fashion effective financial literacy interventions that can promote financial inclusion.
   Originality/value - The study uses Baron and Kenny and ModGraph excel software to test for the interaction effect of cognition in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. While several studies exist worldwide on financial inclusion, this study is the first to test the interaction effect of cognition in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor in rural areas in a developing country context.

TI  - The role of entrepreneurship education in the entrepreneurial readiness of generation Z students: why do digital business literacy and financial literacy matter?
T2  - COGENT EDUCATION
AB  - Entrepreneurship has become a central issue in an effort to improve the nation's economic welfare. Several previous studies agree that the ideal country is one that has an entrepreneurial contribution of at least 4% of its total population. However, when compared with other countries, Indonesia's entrepreneurial contribution is currently still low because it has only reached an entrepreneurial ratio of 3.47%. One of the causes of this low contribution is the lack of effective entrepreneurship education. Some empirical evidence has not been able to explain how entrepreneurship education is able to prepare generation Z to become entrepreneurs through various new literacies. This research aims to investigate the influence of entrepreneurship education on the entrepreneurial readiness of generation Z students, which is moderated by digital business literacy and financial literacy. This research was conducted using a quantitative approach and involved 700 students in Makassar City, Indonesia. The data analysis technique used is partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis. Research findings show that entrepreneurship education plays an important role in the entrepreneurial readiness of generation Z students, which is strengthened by digital business literacy and financial literacy. The findings of this research can help expand and develop concepts related to digital business literacy and financial literacy in the context of entrepreneurship education in higher education, so that, by implication, this research provides a valuable contribution to entrepreneurship education, which paves the way for further research regarding entrepreneurial readiness in the context of diverse higher education through various other new literacies.

TI  - Financial literacy, morality, and organizational culture in preventing financial mismanagement: A study on village governments in Indonesia
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - An empirical study was conducted with the aim of testing and analyzing the relationship between the variables of financial literacy, morality, organizational culture, and preventing financial mismanagement. The originality of this research lies in the integration of cultural factors in the organizational context and efforts to prevent financial mismanagement, which are rarely given the attention of researchers. Research design with survey techniques based on quantitative philosophy. The sample chosen to represent the population uses a proportionate random sampling technique. Data collection techniques using a structured questionnaire. Also, the collected data were analyzed using multiple linear regression models and moderation analysis. The results obtained from this study are based on the results of the analysis that financial literacy and morality have a significant effect on preventing financial mismanagement. Other empirical results find that organizational culture is able to moderate the relationship between financial literacy and morality towards preventing financial mismanagement. The contribution of this research is theoretically providing a theoretical phenomenon to the theory of reasoned action in terms of mismanagement behavior and the morale of government employees in the economic development sector of government. Practical contributions are given to village administration so that they consider the determinants of individual behavior in preventing financial mismanagement by increasing good organizational governance. The implication of this research is to provide a reference for village administration to reinforce rules to place more emphasis on individual and organizational behavioral factors.

TI  - Why does subjective financial literacy hinder retirement saving? The mediating roles of risk tolerance and risk perception
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine a mechanism through which subjective financial literacy can exert negative effects on the retirement saving intention and behaviors, which has not been well understood in prior research. Particularly, the authors draw on the relevant risk literature to introduce financial risk tolerance and risk perception as important mediators that transfer subjective financial literacy into reduced retirement saving intention which in turn affects the saving behaviors. Design/methodology/approach The authors test the model with a sample of 347 adults using factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Findings Consistent with the notions about the negative side of subjective financial literacy, the authors find supporting evidence for the proposed indirect effects of financial literacy on retirement saving intention via risk tolerance and risk perception. In addition, the authors observe that an individual's retirement saving intention strongly predicts their retirement saving behaviors. Originality/value The study offers insights into the mechanisms that subjective financial knowledge might also inhibit individual's responsible financial behaviors (e.g. retirement saving).

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of the Effects of Objective and Self-Assessed Financial Literacy on Stock Investment Return
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Till now, comprehensive and quantitatively meaningful analyses of stock market participation outcomes of retail investors have been limited by data sources in developing countries. This article devised a special questionnaire related to stock investment to measure the financial literacy (FL) and stock investment return (SIR) for the subjects with stockownership in China and to theoretically and empirically study the effects of objective FL, self-assessed FL, and their composite FL on SIR. The results of the comparative analysis showed that self-assessed FL has a greater effect on SIR than objective FL, and the effect is mediated by risk preference. In addition, we found that competent and overconfident respondents have higher SIR, while under confident respondents cannot gain from the stock market. We also found that risk preference has a positive mediating effect in the relationship between competence and overconfidence and SIR, and a negative mediating effect in the relationship between under confidence and SIR. We thus concluded that confident investors can gain more stockholding returns via taking more risks regardless of the level of their actual financial knowledge. Our findings would be a meaningful complement to the studies of stock market participation.

TI  - A shift towards household lending during the Fintech era: the role of financial literacy and credit information sharing
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate the determinants of a shift in lending towards household sectors during the growth of fintech credit using a sample of 41 countries between 2015 and 2018. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a fixed-effects model by adding indicators for geographic areas and year dummy variables to achieve this objective. Findings The findings show that the household credit to firm credit ratio is positively associated with credit information sharing and financial literacy, emphasising the importance of credit information sharing mechanism and financial literacy to household credit growth. More interestingly, the findings show that fintech credit development plays a more critical role in the evolution of firm credit than household credit. Nonetheless, fintech credit development may complement the growth of conventional lending. The results still hold when using several robustness checks. Originality/value This is the first attempt to examine the roles of credit information sharing, financial literacy and fintech credit development in a shift in lending activities towards households.

TI  - Financial literacy, value creation and firm performance: an investigation of Italian small and medium enterprises
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP & SMALL BUSINESS
AB  - This article aims to determine the influence of entrepreneurs' financial literacy for the growth of SMEs' value. The paper verifies the hypothesis that there is a significant relationship between financial literacy and value creation, as indicated by economic value added (EVA (R)). The study analyses 162 Italian SMEs operating in the textile and clothing sector. The analysis period is between 2011 and 2013. Regression analysis and correlation analysis have been applied to test the hypotheses. The results suggest a positive and significant relationship between financial literacy and the variables that drive the value creation. Greater financial literacy allows SMEs to optimise their capital structure and select the most profitable projects. This work is useful to stimulate debate on the role of financial education in mitigating the difficulties of small and medium entrepreneurs in achieving value creation goals and in enabling policy makers to identify gaps and design appropriate responses.

TI  - Factors that influence the level of financial literacy among young people: The role of parental engagement and students' experiences with money matters
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB  - This paper focused on the family as context for financial socialization and students' experiences with money matters to explain the acquisition of financial knowledge of young people in fifteen OECD countries and economies. We used data from the second OECD PISA financial literacy assessment in 2015. Multilevel regressions of students' performance in financial literacy were presented. When explaining financial literacy differences across countries a significant predictor of financial literacy was a well-functioning educational system proxied in our study by the quality of its mathematical and scientific education. After accounting for performance in mathematics and reading and other variables, estimates of multilevel regressions by country showed that students' financial literacy was associated mainly with understanding the value of saving and discussing money matters with parents. In some countries, exposure to (and the use of) financial products - in particular, holding a bank account - improved students' financial knowledge as well.

TI  - An empirical assessment of financial literacy and behavioral biases on investment decision: Fresh evidence from small investor perception
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - To have enough financial literacy, an investor must be able to make intelligent investment choices, and on the other hand, the heuristic bias, the framing effect, cognitive illusions, and herd mentality are all variables that contribute to the formation of behavioral biases, also known as illogical conduct, in the decision-making process. The current research looks specifically at behavioral biases and financial literacy influence investment choices, particularly on stock market investment. For the research, a representative sample of 450 individual investors was evaluated. A structured questionnaire was designed using the Likert's scale method to elicit the research variables, and the data acquired were analyzed using the SEM method. According to the findings, there was a statistically significant link between heuristic bias and the development of behavioral bias in decision-making. Nevertheless, cognitive illusions, the herd mentality, and the framing effect all have a deleterious impact on behavioral biases. In addition, investors often adhere to heuristic biases rather than other irrational strategies when making investment judgments. Therefore, individual investors' financial literacy level greatly influences the choices made about investments in the stock market.

T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This study aimed to determine the effect of Islamic financial literacy, spiritual intelligence, public perception, and behaviour on public interest in Islamic banking services. This research is classified as quantitative research. Islamic financial literacy, spiritual intelligence, and public perception are independent variables. Public behaviour as a mediating variable. The population in this study is the entire community in Padang city who are already customers of Islamic banks. The sample is determined by the Hair method, five times the number of indicators, where the number of indicators is 46 items. The number of respondents in this study was 230 people. Data analysis using structural equation model by using Smart-PLS. The results show Islamic financial literacy and public perception have no significant effect on public interest in Islamic banking services. However, spiritual intelligence has a positive and significant effect on public interest in Islamic banking services. Public behaviour fully mediates the relationship between public perception and public interest in Islamic banking services. Islamic banking is expected to be able to educate prospective customers through increasing spiritual intelligence. Public behaviour can be improved with the religiosity community, thereby increasing interest in saving in Islamic banks.

TI  - Propensity Score Weighting with Mismeasured Covariates: An Application to Two Financial Literacy Interventions
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Estimation of the causal effect of a binary treatment on outcomes often requires conditioning on covariates to address selection concerning observed variables. This is not straightforward when one or more of the covariates are measured with error. Here, we present a new semi-parametric estimator that addresses this issue. In particular, we focus on inverse propensity score weighting estimators when the propensity score is of an unknown functional form and some covariates are subject to classical measurement error. Our proposed solution involves deconvolution kernel estimators of the propensity score and the regression function weighted by a deconvolution kernel density estimator. Simulations and replication of a study examining the impact of two financial literacy interventions on the business practices of entrepreneurs show our estimator to be valuable to empirical researchers.

TI  - Shedding light on the impact of financial literacy for corporate social responsibility during the COVID-19 crisis: managerial and financial perspectives
T2  - MANAGEMENT DECISION
AB  - Purpose The aim of this paper is to help management scholars and executives learn from the COVID-19 global crisis by analyzing if and how the level of financial literacy affected stakeholders' sensitivity to corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues during the pandemic, as well as identifying whether financial literacy is an important variable to account for in the postpandemic period. The authors test the relationship between objective (measurable) and subjective (self-assessed) financial literacy, as well as financial happiness (i.e. satisfaction with one's current financial situation) with CSR during the pandemic. High levels of financial literacy cause individuals to reward companies that implement CSR strategies and processes. Design/methodology/approach The authors designed an online survey and obtained data on objective and subjective financial literacy, financial happiness and COVID-19 infections, as well as on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of a representative sample of 1,334 Italian respondents. From a methodological point of view, the authors perform a factor analysis on the CSR-related questions to extract the principal components (PCs) that were used as dependent variables in the regression models to analyze the effects of explanatory variables (financial literacy, financial happiness and COVID-19 infections) and consider the control variables (demographic and socioeconomic characteristics). The authors follow a theoretical approach merging stakeholder theory with CSR. Findings Respondents with a high level of financial literacy and financial happiness are highly sensitive to all CSR components (ethical, philanthropic, economic and legal social responsibilities). Being infected by COVID-19 increased participants' sensitivity to ethical and philanthropic social responsibility (SR), but not to economic and legal SR. The more educated and employed respondents were, the more sensitive they were to CSR, especially compared to their less educated and unemployed counterparts. Research limitations/implications While the sample used is large and representative of the Italian population, Italy is an interesting and useful case to analyze, given that it was the first Western country to be severely hit by COVID-19; since the paper only refers to a specific country scenario, the results cannot be generalized to other countries. A cross-country comparison relating financial literacy and financial happiness to CSR during the COVID-19 pandemic period would be desirable. The research study has theoretical implications for management scholars since the authors show that, during the pandemic period, financial education and financial happiness are relevant in explaining stakeholders' greater sensitivity to CSR issues. The findings may thus help scholars to learn from the COVID-19 period, with the aim of further developing and enhancing stakeholders' theory. Practical implications The research also has practical implications, both for corporate executives and for policymakers, helping them to learn from the COVID-19 global crisis concerning the role of financial literacy and financial happiness on CSR sensitivity and, consequently, how they may consider these important variables in the postpandemic era. On the one hand, executives may improve stakeholders' segmentation and eventually modify CSR policies, considering the higher sensitivity of their stakeholders' due to a higher degree of financial literacy.
   On the other hand, the findings suggest that policymakers should have a stronger role in supporting employment and education in general and in promoting programs to improve financial literacy to increase stakeholders' sensitivity to CSR, thus further stimulating the inclusion of CSR factors in companies' strategies. Increasing stakeholders' sensitivity to CSR will, in turn, increase the propensity of companies to include SR in their strategies. Thus, increasing financial literacy will have tangible positive effects of increasing CSR. Given the greater role played by companies during the COVID-19 period with respect to societal risk, the findings seem particularly useful. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first that links financial literacy and financial happiness with CSR during the COVID-19 crisis. The large and representative dataset, as well as the use of specific variables related to financial literacy, financial happiness and COVID-19 infections in the CSR assessment model, makes our analysis original, robust and significant by contributing to the CSR literature and to the financial literacy literature from a methodological point of view, as well as by informing corporate executives and policymakers about the role of financial literacy with regard to CSR during the pandemic, which may help them in learning how to improve their decisions and actions in the postpandemic era.

T2  - EDUCATION ECONOMICS
AB  - We evaluate whether a scalable online teacher professional development (OTPD) module that requires little time investment enhances students' financial literacy. Two randomised controlled trials were performed, with 1827 students, 53 teachers and 47 schools participating. The financial education programme on its own increased students' financial knowledge, but did not improve financial behaviour. Regarding the OTPD effects, we observed that students' knowledge scores did not significantly improve, but that behaviour scores were enhanced relative to students whose teachers did not receive access to the OTPD module. In comparison with students in the control condition, behaviour scores improved with 0.39 SD.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION SCIENCE
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to explore the intricate relationship between financial literacy, digital transformation, Fintech adoption, competitiveness and sustainable firm performance, particularly focusing on how financial literacy empowers firms in the evolving digital landscape. Leveraging technological innovation systems (TIS) and resource-based view (RBV), this research suggests a model that incorporates these concepts, focusing on the moderating role of financial literacy in essential interactions.Design/methodology/approachThis study employed a survey-based methodology, collecting data from employees across five major Pakistani banks. The survey yielded 426 responses, from which 387 valid ones were selected for analysis. The analysis utilized partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), complemented by the Hayes Process Model for moderated mediation analysis. This approach ensured robust examination of the relationships between the constructs of the proposed model.FindingsThe study's findings validate that digital transformation significantly enhances sustainable performance, with Fintech adoption and competitiveness acting as crucial mediators. Financial literacy is highlighted as a key moderator, influencing the effects of digital transformation on Fintech adoption and competitiveness, although its direct impact on sustainable performance is less pronounced. This comprehensive analysis underscores the complex interplay among these factors in driving sustainable performance in the banking sector.Originality/valueThis research enriches the theoretical and practical comprehension of how digital transformation and Fintech integration, underpinned by financial literacy, bolster sustainable business outcomes. It sheds light on the synergy between technology, strategy and organizational success, offering key insights for the banking industry's navigation through the digital era's challenges.

TI  - Sharia Financial Knowledge And Financial Behavior As A Basis For Measuring Financial Literacy
T2  - QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB  - Our daily life is inseparable from financial problems. Problems in finances are more often caused by errors in management, as well as errors in distinguishing between needs and wants. One of the reasons for the number of poor people in Medan City is their lack of ability to manage their finances to meet their daily needs. The level of public financial literacy will also provide benefits to the financial sector, especially those directly related to the public's contribution to the use of financial products and services. The conventional financial system approach is very different from the Islamic financial system or what is commonly referred to as Islamic finance. This study aims to analyze the level of knowledge of Islamic finance, and financial behavior, and also analyze the effect of knowledge of Islamic finance on financial behavior and the level of Islamic financial literacy of members of the Muhammadiyah organization in Medan City. This type of research is quantitative research with the method of deduction. Research is included in the type of correlational research. Data The population in this study is a large Muhammadiyah family in the city of Medan with the sampling process using the purposive sampling method. Data sourced from respondents was obtained through questionnaires. This research uses SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) analysis tool. The results showed that in general the level of Islamic financial knowledge of Muhammadiyah members was low, but financial behavior was good. The behavior and knowledge of members ' Islamic finance show a positive and significant correlation. At the literacy level, the results show that members of the Muhammadiyah organization are generally classified as less literate.

TI  - Gender, Financial Literacy and Pension Savings
T2  - ECONOMIC RECORD
AB  - The relationship between the gender gap in financial literacy and pension savings is examined in this paper. In Australia, individuals have considerable discretion with respect to how their pension savings are managed. We argue that financial literacy should have a positive impact on the profitability of these decisions. Analysis based on micro-data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey suggests that a sizable share of the gender gap in pension savings can be attributed to the gender gap in financial literacy. Therefore, policies aimed at improving the financial literacy of women should help improve the living standards of women in retirement.

TI  - Influence of financial literacy on investment decisions of managers of small and medium enterprises in Mogadishu, Somalia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES
AB  - This research aimed to explore how well managers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Mogadishu, Somalia, understand financial concepts such as savings, managing debt, handling financial risks, and planning for retirement, and how this understanding affects their investment decisions. The background of the study highlights that many SMEs in Mogadishu struggle to sustain their operations, with low profits or failure often due to poor investment choices. To investigate the link between financial literacy and investment decision -making among these managers, the study was based on the principles of modern portfolio theory. The research used a correlational design to analyze data from 250 targeted SMEs, with 154 respondents selected through stratified random sampling. Data collection was facilitated by questionnaires, and the analysis involved calculating means, standard deviations, and conducting regression analysis. The findings indicated that among the financial literacy components, debt management had the most significant impact on investment decisions (beta=0.490, p<0.05), followed by financial risk management (beta=0.137, p<0.05), and lastly, the ability to save (beta=0.128, p<0.05). The study concluded that financial literacy plays a crucial role in influencing investment decisions among SME managers in Mogadishu, suggesting that improving financial knowledge could lead to better business outcomes.

TI  - Financial literacy in Hungarian libraries: Survey-based steps for implementation
T2  - JOURNAL OF LIBRARIANSHIP AND INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB  - In Hungarian libraries, the development of financial literacy (FL) is either not present at all or is very low in intensity. The Hungarian government strategy does not involve libraries in FL development. Based on the dissemination of information and digital literacy, there are numerous good examples worldwide proving that libraries, reaching all of their users, can effectively take part in financial education and, built thereon, business development and business information services. This can increase their social recognition and even supplement their funding. In 2022, for the first time in the country, the authors conducted a survey among Hungarian librarians to assess the current situation, to identify what hinders the expansion of services related to FL, and what tasks should be performed and what innovations should be introduced in libraries. The survey also seeks to define which fields of competence are to be acquired by librarians. It also reveals the forms of external professional cooperation that are necessary to organise library programmes strengthening financial awareness. The results provide valuable information not only for Hungary, but also internationally, since they showcase the challenges that the library system of a former socialist country in Europe faces after three decades of market economy in this current, market- and profit-oriented world.

TI  - Effect of Financial Literacy on Starting a New Business: Using Survival Analysis to Examine Differences between Older and Younger Entrepreneurs
T2  - ESIC MARKET
AB  - Objective: This paper focuses on financial literacy as an antecedent to entrepreneurial involvement in order to examine and better understand differences between older and younger entrepreneurs. Financial literacy is the ability to apply the knowledge and skills needed to effectively manage financial resources over the life-course and is related to a wide range of economic outcomes.
   Methodology: The antecedence of financial literacy with respect to entrepreneurial engagement is examined using novel entrepreneurship data from the United States. The study uses three waves (2014, 2016, and 2019) of complex survey data from the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative and probability-based internet panel of households representing roughly 8,500 respondents ages 18 and older, and active since 2014. The data are used to generate survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method, and to run survey linear and Cox proportional hazards regression models where outcomes are starting a new business with respect to two time frames: over one's lifetime, and since 2014.
   Results: The results show that there are associations between financial literacy and the rate of starting a new business both over one's lifetime and since 2014, but only among older adults.
   Limitations: The study data were collected using a sample of adults in the United States which may limit the generalizability of the study findings to countries and regions other than the United States.

TI  - Entrepreneurial financial literacy-small business sustainability nexus in Ethiopia
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study empirically examined the relationship between entrepreneurial financial literacy, access to credit, and the sustainability of small businesses in Ethiopia. The study used cross-sectional data collected from 293 owner-managers of small businesses through a survey questionnaire in 2022. It used structural equation modelling to analyze the results. Therefore, the paper's empirical evidence revealed that entrepreneurial financial literacy contributes to small business sustainability. The findings also show that access to formal credit financing mediates entrepreneurial financial literacy- small business sustainability nexus. In this regard, the paper contributes to the literature on small businesses by demonstrating the importance of entrepreneurial financial literacy and access to formal credit financing for the sustainability of small businesses in Ethiopia, considering the knowledge-resource-based view.

TI  - The Relationship Between Financial Education in Young Adults and Financial Literacy: A Review of the Literature in Canada and the United States
T2  - ACCOUNTING PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Professional accounting bodies in Canada and the United States, and throughout the world, have funded programs to improve financial literacy for many years. This ongoing interest stems from the expected benefits of improved financial behavior for individuals, society, and financial markets. However, the fact that relatively little research on financial literacy has been published in accounting journals suggests that few accounting academics are aware of, interested in, or motivated to work on the topic. This review helps to identify what we know about the effectiveness of financial education programs intended specifically for young adults, who constitute the demographic group likely to gain the most from improved financial literacy. Our review identifies factors that impinge both on the effectiveness of financial education programs and the research examining these programs. Noteworthy factors include (1) a lack of theoretical frameworks to guide the programs and research on the programs, (2) a tendency for outcome measures to capture financial knowledge rather than financial behaviors, and (3) the need for stronger research designs. We also note some possible instructional design considerations in developing financial education programs and highlight financial literacy as a promising area of research for accounting academics. Our findings can help guide improvements to financial education programs and encourage further research to assess the effectiveness of financial literacy programs.

TI  - Influence of human capital and social capital on MSME access to finance: assessing the mediating role of financial literacy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThe authors investigate the role of financial literacy in influencing the relationship between human capital and social capital, with access to finance of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).Design/methodology/approachData were gathered from 337 MSMEs in Brunei Darussalam, and analysis on the data was carried out using a number of statistical methods. The relationships between human capital, social capital, financial literacy and access to finance were analyzed using PLS-SEM.FindingsThe results show that human capital does influence access to finance but contrary to previous studies, the influence is negative. Financial literacy is an important element in the relationship between human capital, social capital and access to finance, although it plays a greater role in the relationship between social capital and access to finance. Further analysis shows that financial knowledge is significant in moderating the relationships between human and social capital with access to finance. Financial skills is found to only moderate the relationship between social capital and access to finance.Originality/valueTo the authors' knowledge, this study is the first that integrates the human capital, social capital, financial literacy and access to finance in a single model. The authors also highlight the importance of enhancing the financial literacy of MSMEs so that the problem of access to finance can be alleviated, especially in developing countries.

TI  - On a Need-to-Know Basis: How the Distribution of Responsibility Between Couples Shapes Financial Literacy and Financial Outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB  - Many consumers suffer from low levels of financial literacy, and attempts to increase this dimension of consumer expertise via educational interventions are typically unsuccessful. We argue that many of these apparent deficits are caused by the distribution of responsibility for knowledge and decision-making between relationship partners. Early in relationships, responsibility for financial matters is often determined not by differences in financial expertise, but by differences in relative contributions to other domains (study 3). Although responsibility may be initially unrelated to ability, responsibility predicts learning of new financial information (study 4). Cross-sectional data from consumers in long-term relationships show that as relationships lengthen, high levels of financial responsibility are associated with increases in financial literacy, whereas low levels of financial responsibility are not (study 1). These diverging trajectories of expertise cannot be explained by role switching or changes in the sample over time (study 2). The resulting gap in financial literacy is linked to corresponding differences in both financial decision-making and financial information search (studies 5, 5a). Consumers develop expertise on a "need to know" basis. Offloading responsibility to a relationship partner may eliminate this need in the present, while simultaneously creating barriers to developing expertise when needed in the future.

TI  - Financial Inclusion, Financial Literacy and Economically Vulnerable Populations in the Middle East and North Africa
T2  - EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
AB  - Using microdata from the 2014 Global Findex, along with macroeconomic indicators, we investigate financial inclusion for the MENA region. We find that economically vulnerable populations are significantly less likely to be financially included. Households living in MENA countries with higher levels of financial literacy are more likely to be engaged in positive savings behaviors and less likely to be borrowing, especially from informal sources. Financial literacy and other macro characteristics, however, do not relate to all individuals equally, especially for those most vulnerable. The findings have important implications for policies in the MENA region, where prolonged conflicts make financial inclusion an even more urgent, yet challenging, goal.

TI  - How financial literacy moderates the relationship between qualitative business information and the success of an equity crowdfunding campaign: Evidence from Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperation Council countries
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - This paper presents empirical evidence suggesting that financial literacy moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship between the amount of qualitative business information provided and the success of an equity crowdfunding campaign. Drawing on a sample of 807 equity offerings posted on 26 platforms operating in 6 Mediterranean and Gulf Cooperation Council countries (Cyprus, France, Israel, Italy, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates), the findings indicate that higher levels of financial literacy amplify the positive effect of more comprehensive qualitative business information. However, once a qualitative business information threshold is crossed, financial literacy results related to observed negative returns are even more substantial. These results, rooted into the signalling and information overload theoretical frameworks, offer valuable insights for entrepreneurs, platform administrators, investors and policymakers.

TI  - What Influences the Financial Literacy of Young Adults? A Combined Analysis of Socio-Demographic Characteristics and Delay of Gratification
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The current economic landscape is complex and globalized, and it imposes on individuals the responsibility for their own financial security. This situation has been intensified by the COVID-19 crisis, since short-time work and layoffs significantly limit the availability of financial resources for individuals. Due to the long duration of the lockdown, these challenges will have a long-term impact and affect the financial well-being of many citizens. Moreover, it can be assumed that the consequences of this crisis will once again particularly affect groups of people who have already frequently been identified as having low financial literacy. Financial literacy is therefore an important target for educational measures and interventions. However, it cannot be considered in isolation but must take into account the many potential factors that influence financial literacy alone or in combination. These include personality traits and socio-demographic factors as well as the (in)ability to defer gratification. Against this background, individualized support offers can be made. With this in mind, in the first step of this study, we analyze the complex interaction of personality traits, socio-demographic factors, the (in-)ability to delay gratification, and financial literacy. In the second step, we differentiate the identified effects regarding different groups to identify moderating effects, which, in turn, allow conclusions to be drawn about the need for individualized interventions. The results show that gender and educational background moderate the effects occurring between self-reported financial literacy, financial learning opportunities, delay of gratification, and financial literacy.

TI  - Do the effects of individual factors on financial risk-taking behavior diversify with financial literacy?
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to examine the roles of individual factors on risky investment intention as an indicator of risky financial behavior.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected from a survey instrument and composed of 496 individuals' responses. The authors exploited structural equation modelling and multigroup structural equation modelling for direct and indirect effects, respectively.
   Findings - Results indicate that emotional intelligence and locus of control have a positive impact on financial risk-taking, while risk aversion in general has the negative one. Although financial literacy does not have a direct effect on risky financial behavior, it has important role as a moderator variable, interacting with external locus of control.
   Originality/value - The authors expect this study to contribute into behavioral finance literature in two ways. First, they investigate joint and relative effects of four major factors (i.e. emotional intelligence, locus of control, risk aversion in general and financial literacy) identified in the literature on financial risk-taking of individual investors. Each belongs to a different venue in an individual's psyche and therefore is expected to influence financial risk-taking through different mechanisms. However, the research arguing their roles on the financial risky behavior directly is very limited. Investigating their individual effects is likely to provide unique insights into our understanding of risky financial behavior. Second, the authors also posit and manifest that the effects of the first three of the aforementioned factors on risk-taking intentions are moderated by financial literacy. This finding is likely to provide rather valuable insights pertaining to the emergence of risk-taking behaviors and may shed light on the root reasons behind equivocal findings in previous research regarding the effect of each factor.

The UTAUT model was enhanced with the incorporation of security and awareness to develop the theoretical model for this investigation. The paper investigates the impact of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, social influence, security, and awareness on the behavioral intention to use Cryptocurrency. The moderating role of financial literacy was also investigated on the associations between the proposed adoption factors and the behavioral intention to use Cryptocurrency. SmartPLS 3.2.8 software was used to analyse 344 responses collected via an online survey. The Findings showed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, security, and awareness positively impact on behavioral intention to use Cryptocurrency. Moreover, financial literacy moderates the associations between performance expectancy, security, social influence, and behavioral intention. The findings offer valuable insights to Cryptocurrency users, Cryptocurrency developers, and the government of the KSA.

TI  - Financial literacy in tourism and management & business administration entry-level students: A comparative view
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY LEISURE SPORT & TOURISM EDUCATION
AB  - Financial competences are essential in the tourism industry and consequently are valued in hiring and promotion decisions. However, according to the literature, tourism graduates appear to have inadequate levels of financial skills. The perceived lack of required competences results in a competitive disadvantage for tourism graduates in favour of those who studied Management & Business Administration, or equivalent degrees. To explain this gap, some authors point to the scarcity of finance-related courses within the curriculum of most of tourism or hospitality programs, but it is also suggested that the characteristics of the students enrolling in tourism and hospitality degrees could play a relevant role, highlighting that those students lack the required background knowledge and attitudes resulting in major constraints for financial competences development. Our study compares the levels of financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, numeracy, and financial interest of entry-level students enrolled in these two competing university degrees, Tourism and Management & Business Administration.Our results indicate significant differences in both variables that in addition to the scarcity of finance subjects in the tourism curriculum could affect the students' prospects and employability.

TI  - What makes equity crowdfunding successful in Japan? Testing the signaling and lack of financial literacy hypotheses
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND INNOVATION
AB  - PURPOSE: The first objective of this study is to identify the factors that contribute to the success of equity crowdfunding (ECF) campaigns in Japan. We examined what makes a campaign successful using data from 217 campaigns conducted on FUNDINNO, Japan's largest ECF platform, between February 2017 and May 2021. The second objective is to assess individual investors' financial literacy based on the ECF campaign's success or failure. This study is unique in that it focuses on funding method differences as well as the contents of the business plans disclosed in the ECF campaigns. In Japan, a common equity campaign and stock acquisition rights campaign are run on the same ECF platform, as if they were the same type of funding. Common stock and stock acquisition rights are treated differently by venture capitalists and other professional investors. By comparing the success or failure of the two Japanese projects, we can assess individual investors' financial literacy after taking into account the project signals. METHODOLOGY: The "Signaling Hypothesis" and the "Lack of Financial Literacy Hypothesis" were tested. Nine and four variables were set as proxy variables for the Signaling Hypothesis and the Lack of Financial Literacy Hypothesis, respectively. This study first divides the qualitative data into success/failure dichotomies for the proxy variables that comprise the hypotheses and then uses a chi-square test to examine the composition ratio of each. The quantitative data among the hypotheses' proxy variables are then tested for differences in means (t-test) and medians (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Subsequently, we perform a probit analysis with the explained variable being "success (1)/failure (0)" and the explanatory variable being a proxy variable for the hypothesis. We begin with a probit analysis, and the Logit model is then introduced. Finally, a multiple regression analysis is run with the explained variables "fundraising rate" and "number of investors" and the hypothesized proxy variables as explanatory variables. FINDINGS: We found that the "number of directors" is an effective management ability indicator of ECF success. In terms of start-up fundamentals, investors appear to accept the signals "intellectual property", "product releases" and "tax incentives." Awards affected the size of the final funding round. In contrast, B2C companies negatively signaled to private investors. The proxy variable "in final year sales" was supported concerning the lack of a financial literacy hypothesis. Individual investors can be assumed to be financially literate if they perform due diligence. However, since "expected rate of return (Internal Rate of Return, hereafter abbreviated as IRR)" and "common stock dummy" are uncorrelated, we can conclude that they do not demonstrate financial literacy in "valuation," nor whether or not the investment is profitable. Thus, individual investors' financial literacy in the Japanese ECF can be considered to be limited. IMPLICATIONS: We have demonstrated which signals investors in Japan's ECF campaigns respond to. These guidelines will be useful for future start-ups planning ECF campaigns. We were able to identify the lack of financial literacy among ECF individual investors. Therefore, for Japan's equity capital market to grow in the future, individual investors' financial literacy must be improved. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: With very limited analysis in Asia, home to the world's second-and third largest stock markets, we have identified the factors behind the success of Japan's ECF.
   Identifying success factors in a country like Japan, where many individual investors are extremely risk averse, will provide new insights. By comparing the success or failure of the two types of Japanese ECF projects (common equity projects and stock acquisition rights), we could test the financial literacy of individual investors, taking into account the project signals.

TI  - The Impact of Financial Literacy on Retirement Planning with Serial Mediation of Financial Risk Tolerance and Saving Behavior: Evidence of Medium Entrepreneurs in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - This research examined the gist of financial literacy on the medium entrepreneurs in Indonesia, impacting the retirement planning through some mediator and moderating variables. Implementing the prospect theory and theory of planned behavior to explore these interactions, a series of hypotheses were constructed, considering financial risk tolerance and saving behavior as mediator variables and herding behavior as moderator variables. The study examined partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) obtained by sampling data from 388 entrepreneurs of medium-scale in the Bekasi Regency, Indonesia. The study revealed (a) how financial literacy on retirement planning is serial mediated by financial risk tolerance and saving behavior, (b) herding behavior can strengthen financial literacy's influence on retirement planning, and (c) saving behavior as a mediator does not influence the relationship between financial literacy and retirement planning. The study confirms how financial risk tolerance and herding behavior bridge a positive relationship between financial literacy and retirement planning.

TI  - On the relationship between financial literacy and choice behaviours under different risk elicitation methods in surveys
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - A few pieces of literature based primarily on experiments have proved that the risk elicitation instrument can affect the measurement of subject's risk preferences. Using the China Household Finance Survey data, we focus on the risk choice behaviours of respondents when they choose between two different elicitation methods that have different complexities and a different number of options, respectively. Specifically, one is simpler but with more options, and another is more complex but with fewer options. Moreover, we further discuss the impact of two methods on the relationship between financial literacy and risk attitude. The theoretical and empirical studies indicate that the respondents will be more risk-loving in the elicitation method with simpler and more options because of computation avoiding and noisy behaviours. Also, this paper finds that financial literacy has a positive relation with risk preferences, and low-literacy respondents have more irrational drift behaviours of risk choice. Our results suggest that it is vital to tradeoff the complexity and number of options for risk elicitation methods in surveys.

TI  - Covid-19 and the changing face of financial literacy in India : Evidence from Delhi NCR during lockdowns
T2  - JOURNAL OF STATISTICS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
AB  - With a change in global market entanglement and composite retail financial products, financial literacy has gained distinction in the recent past. More importantly, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought attention to the preparation of individuals' financial budgets for unforeseen losses. As a result, financial literacy has gained immense importance. Literature available on the subject suggests that individuals when faced with a situation of crisis, tend to reduce their risk of not paying the liabilities, by controlling their budget. This research article aims to understand whether or not individuals with a good understanding of financial literacy have better skills in financial management, particularly during lockdowns. Primary data was collected after the second phase of lockdowns in August 2021 from 232 individuals residing in Delhi NCR, using a questionnaire adapted from the OECD study. Besides, a scale was developed to understand their financial behaviour and financial management skills. The results of the study indicate that a good understanding of financial principles helped manage financial risk effectively and avoid any financial pitfalls. It helps individuals avoid financial concerns and enable individuals to regulate their income, even in challenging conditions like the Covid-19 pandemic.

TI  - Financial literacy and its impact on life satisfaction in rural households: a mediated approach via financial self-efficacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeThe study aims to explore the relationship between financial literacy and general life satisfaction. The study further investigates the mediating role of financial self-efficacy in this relationship in the context of Indian rural households.Design/methodology/approachHouseholds belonging to the rural area of the Koraput district of Odisha were taken as the sample unit of this study. A structured questionnaire was framed to collect primary data using multi-stage and convenience sampling; 299 responses were received. Data analyses were performed using partial least square-structure equation modelling through SmartPLS 4.0.FindingsThe results of the study connoted that financial literacy has a noteworthy impact on the overall life satisfaction of households with lower incomes, both directly and indirectly. Moreover, the study identified financial self-efficacy as a significant complementary partial mediator in the relationship between financial literacy and overall satisfaction with life.Practical implicationsThe findings of the study can be used by financial regulatory authorities and policymakers to seed the financial concepts' understanding among the rural community to enhance their financial status and thereby overall satisfaction with life.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, the exploration study of life satisfaction of rural households is yet to be discovered in the context of previous research frameworks despite rural households being an intricate part of the Indian economy. The study adds to the existing literature on life satisfaction, necessitating financial literacy expertise in rural households for achieving financial self-efficacy.

TI  - CEO attributes and borrowing costs: exploring the moderating role of financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT
AB  - This study examines the effect of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) attributes on borrowing costs and the moderating role of the CEO's financial literacy on this relationship. We employed 2926 firm-year observations of non-financial firms listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. We used ordinary least squares regression to test the hypotheses and further employed fixed effect analysis, generalized method of moments estimation and two-stage least squares analysis to resolve the possible endogeneity concerns. Our empirical results indicate that CEO age, tenure, ownership and gender are negatively associated with borrowing costs, whereas CEO duality is positively associated with borrowing costs. Furthermore, we report that a financially literate CEO strengthens the relationships in the cases of age, tenure, ownership and gender while it weakens the relationship in the case of CEO duality. Our results provide novel evidence in this context and extend empirical support to upper echelons theory in the case of an emerging economy.

TI  - UNDERSTANDING DRIVERS OF CONSUMER LOYALTY IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF GENERATION Z INDIVIDUALS EXHIBITING HIGH VS. LOW FINANCIAL LITERACY
T2  - MANAGEMENT-JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY MANAGEMENT ISSUES
AB  - The banking industry, which plays an essential role in any economy, is characterized by customers choosing a bank in early adulthood. For this reason, Generation Z is currently the emerging cohort of consumers in the banking industry, and understanding their behavior is paramount to a bank's success. In this paper, we (re)consider a model of the relationship between satisfaction and loyalty in the context of Generation Z, separately analyzing individuals with high financial literacy and those with low financial literacy. The results suggest that individuals with low financial literacy, as compared to individuals with high financial literacy, rely more heavily on subjective cues (such as customer feedback) when recommending to others and creating cognitive loyalty and that these customers tend to remain loyal primarily due to inertia. The findings have important implications for banks that need to segment their consumers according to their financial literacy (high vs. low), - as satisfaction, cognitive loyalty, willingness to recommend, and behavioral loyalty are driven by different mechanisms in the two segments.

TI  - The nexus between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success among young entrepreneurs from a low-income community in Cape Town: a mixed-method analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to explore the association between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success among young entrepreneurs within an economically disadvantaged community in Cape Town, South Africa.
   Design/methodology/approach - The mixed-method approach was adopted for the study. In-depth interviews were used in collecting the qualitative data while structured interviews using questionnaires were administered in collecting the quantitative data. The participants for the study were strictly young entrepreneurs.
   Findings - The study found that entrepreneurs understood the concept of financial literacy and this was corroborated by their financial literacy average score of 59.03, which is above the national financial literacy average score of 54.00. The study further revealed that a positive association exists between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success. Hence, high levels of financial literacy result in increased business success.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample size of the study was relatively small, for which reason, a mixed-method approach was adopted to strengthen the research findings. The research also considered only one disadvantaged community in South Africa (Khayelitsha).
   Originality/value - To the best of the knowledge, the influences of financial literacy on the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) among young entrepreneurs have not been well-explored in economically disadvantaged areas within the South African context. As a result, this study sheds light by assessing the level of financial literacy among young entrepreneurs in economically disadvantaged communities and by determining the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurial success. The study further provides recommendations on policy-making to ensure that through successful entrepreneurship, developmental challenges such as unemployment can be reduced.

TI  - GENERATION Z's FINANCIAL BEHAVIOUR: THE ROLE OF ISLAMIC FINANCIAL LITERACY
T2  - ISRA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC FINANCE
AB  - Purpose - This research aims to examine the effect of family communication patterns on Islamic financial literacy (IFL) and risk tolerance of Generation Z (Gen Z) in Indonesia. It also examines the link between IFL, risk tolerance and financial behaviour. Finally, it highlights the moderating impact of IFL on the link between risk tolerance and financial behaviour.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - This study used Muslim members of Gen Z in West Sumatra Indonesia who were born between 1995 and 2001 as the population. This study collected 668 responses in two months. After some preliminary tests, such as missing value and normality test, it employed 571 usable responses as the sample. Purposive sampling was conducted and variance-based structural equation model-partial least square (SEM-PLS) was employed as the method for data analysis.
   Findings - The results show that family communication patterns, both conformity and conversation orientation, positively and significantly influence IFL and risk tolerance. IFL has a positive and significant impact on risk tolerance and financial behaviour. Surprisingly, IFL also moderates the link between risk tolerance and financial behaviour positively and significantly. Finally, risk tolerance significantly affects financial behaviour.
   Originality/Value - This research makes three theoretical contributions. First, it provides a better understanding and a more complex model of the relationship between IFL with its antecedents such as family communication patterns and also with its consequences, including risk tolerance and financial behaviour. Second, it reveals that IFL affects Gen Z's financial behaviour significantly-an aspect which is neglected in previous research. Third, it has expanded the scope of prior studies by addressing IFL as a moderator of the link between risk tolerance and Gen Z's financial behaviour.
   Research Limitations/Implications - Even though this study has carried out Harman's single-factor analysis to anticipate a common method bias, it faces the common method bias problem due to the cross-sectional nature of the study. Secondly, the study focuses on Gen Z, which means that most of the respondents are students and their financial behaviour is still affected by the decisions of their parents.
   Practical Implications - This study has some contributions for decision makers such as Otoritas Jasa Kewangan (Financial Services Authority) and management of Islamic banks and financial institutions. First, to increase Gen Z's IFL, the decision makers have to educate the parents using the two-way communication orientation method. Second, the financial behaviour of Gen Z is influenced by financial literacy and risk tolerance; hence, decision makers such as the government and society have to educate Gen Z on IFL and inform them about financial risks which influence their risk tolerance when conducting financial activities.

TI  - Racial Differences in the Returns to Financial Literacy Education
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - We examine financial literacy and the returns to financial literacy education, specifically focusing on the racial financial literacy gap. We confirm evidence that whites have higher financial literacy scores relative to minorities and that financial literacy increases with participation in financial literacy education. However, we find the benefit of participation in financial literacy education is higher for whites than that for minorities. Thus, the impact of being white alone persists, indicating a racial financial literacy and/or behavioral difference despite financial literacy education. Our findings have implications for policymakers interested in narrowing the racial wealth gap via financial literacy education.

TI  - Financial Literacy among the Millennial Generation: Relationships between Knowledge, Skills, Attitude, and Behavior
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - This study aims to determine the level of financial literacy among the millennial generation and to examine the correlation of their financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial skills with their financial behavior. Multiple choice questions were used to measure financial knowledge with results grouped into three categories: low, moderate, and high. Financial attitude, financial skills, and financial behavior were also grouped using the quartile method into three categories: poor, fair, and good. Chi-squared analysis was used to test the hypotheses, with correspondence analysis conducted to identify the characteristics of the millennial generation and to graphically illustrate the gap. Regarding financial attitude, financial skills, and financial behavior, the proportions of respondents in the 'fair' category, were 70.6%, 66.5%, and 72.2%, respectively. Significant relationships were found not only between financial attitude and financial management behavior, but also between financial skills and financial management behavior. However, the relationship was not significant between financial knowledge and financial behavior.

TI  - Micro-entrepreneurship Debt Level and Access to Credit: Short-Term Impacts of a Financial Literacy Program
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Using a randomized control trial, we evaluated the effect of a financial literacy program on the level of debt and on formal access to credit in Chile. We use a sample of beneficiaries of a publicly run micro-entrepreneurship program. We evaluated the program using administrative data with information on the debt level, interest rates, and new loans provided by the formal sector. The program tends to decreased debt level in the short run while increasing the probability of having formal debt. The program had effects in parts of the country where the take-up was higher and the implementation was smoother.

TI  - A Critical Analysis of the Impacts of Financial Literacy and NPM on Village Funds Initiative in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
AB  - Since 1999 the Indonesian government has adopted a more democratic and autonomous political system to prevent national disintegration and reduce the economic 'divide' that has appeared in society. To support the policy, the government introduced the Village Funds Initiative in 2014. This study examines how the initiative has been ineffective and riddled with problems due to structural challenges including low financial literacy, complicated budgetary and reporting systems and corruption. The study reminds policy-makers the dangers of NPM (New Public Management) ideology which derived from neoliberal philosophy, and subsequently used in decentralization programs without considering local issues within an individual country.

TI  - Financial education is more precious than money - examining the role of financial literacy in enhancing financial wellbeing among Saudi women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
AB  - The study explores the role of financial literacy, financial socialisation, and certain demographic characteristics (such as income, education, father's education and mother's education) in enhancing financial wellbeing through developing/promoting financial self-efficacy and financial coping behaviours, among Saudi women. There is sparse research evidence available in the literature that examines the levels of financial literacy among Saudi women and how it contributes to their financial wellbeing and the related financial behaviours, this paper therefore, provides important evidence to bridge this important research gap. Based on PLS-based path modelling performed over a set of 1,338 responses from Saudi women, we found a significant positive effect of both the antecedents (i.e., financial literacy and the financial socialisation) on financial wellbeing mediated through financial self-efficacy and (financial) coping behaviours. Similarly, demographic characteristics including women respondents' income, education, father's education, and mother's education are partially positively related to financial self-efficacy as well as the financial coping behaviour. However, demographic characteristics were not seen to be significantly related to financial wellbeing. Besides bridging significant research gaps in the literature, this study provides practical implications for Saudi women to enhance their financial wellbeing through enhancing financial literacy and financial socialisation.

TI  - Financial Literacy in Malaysia, 2015-2018
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the state of financial literacy of Malaysians using data from the OECD (INFE) Financial Literacy Survey conducted in the year 2015 and 2018. Besides the three components of financial literacy, namely, financial knowledge, financial attitude and financial behaviour, this paper also analyses the financial vulnerability of individuals. The effects of socio-demographic factors excluding gender are significant in determining financial literacy levels. Generally, Malaysians do not think that they have high financial knowledge, and the objective financial knowledge assessment reflects this as less than 40% of the respondents meet the minimum financial knowledge target score. There are no significant differences in the level of financial knowledge between 2015 and 2018 but financial attitude towards money usage has worsened in 2018 when compared to 2015. However, in terms of financial behaviour, Malaysians are generally active savers, set long-term financial goals, make considered and informed purchases, and keep a close watch on their personal affairs. Malaysians are financially vulnerable, but they seem more prepared in weathering the storm and having financial cushions for emergencies in 2018 compared to 2015. The findings suggest that more effort is needed in educating Malaysians on fundamental financial concepts and ways to enhance their financial cushion.

TI  - Examining the role of financial intermediaries in promoting financial literacy and financial inclusion among the poor in developing countries: Lessons from rural Uganda
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to establish the mediating role of financial intermediaries in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor in developing countries with data from rural Uganda. The data for this study were analyzed using Partial Least Square (PLS). The results revealed that financial intermediaries significantly mediates the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion. The presence of financial intermediaries such as microfinance banks enhance financial literacy to increase the scope of financial inclusion of the poor in rural Uganda. Thus, policy makers and advocates of financial literacy, especially in developing countries should use financial intermediaries such as microfinance banks to roll out financial literacy programs. This can be achieved through provision of financial literacy clinics, workshops and seminars where the poor can learn about personal finance using hands-on approach. This will help them to make wise financial decisions and choices towards consumption of complex financial products offered by the rural-based financial institutions.

TI  - Financial literacy in predicting investment decisions: do attitude and overconfidence influence?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - PurposeThe significance of financial literacy (FL) in deciding how to allocate one's investment capital has recently attracted much attention from various market participants and stakeholders. The study examines how FL affects individual investors' investment decisions (ID) in emerging markets. Additionally, the study investigates the potential mediating effects of attitude (ATT) and overconfidence bias (OCB) on the association between FL and ID.Design/methodology/approachThe study employed a structured questionnaire to collect data from 311 individual investors in India, using both convenience and snowball sampling methods. The collected data were analysed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) and processed through SMART PLS 4.0 software to test the study's hypotheses.FindingsFL alone may not greatly affect ID, but the study enhances understanding of investor behaviour by examining how ATT and OCB mediate the link between FL and ID. The findings imply that FL, combined with positive ATT and overconfidence, empowers individual investors with the knowledge and skills for appropriate decision-making.Practical implicationsThis research would benefit financial institutions, financial experts, and individual investors in India since it enables them to evaluate the causes and biases affecting their IDs and manage their portfolios accordingly. Policymakers should develop appropriate FL programs for investors to make informed decisions to achieve financial well-being.Originality/valueThe paper is exceptional in its approach as it delves into the mediating function of ATT and OCB in the intricate association between FL and ID. This innovative approach sets it apart from other studies in the field, making it a unique contribution to literature.Peer reviewThe peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/IJSE-05-2023-0370

TI  - Sustaining Performance of Wheat-Rice Farms in Pakistan: The Effects of Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The unceasingly augmenting emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) has contributed substantially to the degradation of the key environmental parameters and the deterioration of performance of the agricultural sector globally. The food insecurity problem has been aggravated consequently. Due to a variety of economic and social issues, many farmers in developing economies use low-efficient and environmentally unfriendly agricultural practices. Adopting innovative technologies and practices linked with sustainable farming remains a complex issue across the developing world. In particular, financial exclusion and low financial literacy are commonly cited as the critical obstacles to achieving sustainable development. To contribute to resolving this development problem, the study attempts to investigate the effects of financial inclusion and literacy on establishing a sustainable performance of farms. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data from 220 farmers within the Central Punjab region of Pakistan. Small-scale farms demonstrated a potential to sustain their performance by improving financial inclusion and financial literacy. Trust in extension services for agriculture plays a significant role in moderating the impact of eight independent variables (knowledge, skills, attitude, behavior, access, usage, quantity, welfare) on sustainable farm performance. The study implies that increased trust in financial services is essential for improving sustainable performance in the agricultural sector. The effect imposed by financial actors is crucial for establishing trust in financial services linked to sustainability within the agricultural industry.

TI  - The nexus of digital financial inclusion, digital financial literacy and demographic factors: lesson from Indonesia
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study aims to answer the impact of digital financial literacy (DFL) and the demographic factors on digital financial inclusion (DFI). This model employed the independent variables that consist of digital financial literacy and demographic factors including gender, age, occupation, marital status, income. By applying purposive sampling, this study collected the data from 160 households who have minimum one banks' accounts. To answer the research hypotheses, this study analyzed the data using binary logistic regression that categorized sample into DFI or otherwise. Based on the model fit test, the findings showed that DFL and demographic factors affect DFI. The effect of gender and marital status showed an insignificant effect on DFI. Conversely, DFL and other demographic factors including age, income, occupation significantly explain DFI in Indonesian household. The model can predict 84.4% respondents in a correct classification as DFI or otherwise.
   This study highlights the impact of digital financial literacy (DFL) and demographic factors on digital financial inclusion (DFI) among Indonesian households. It contributes in filling the research gap which is conducted using entrepreneurial households. DFI has become a crucial factor to accelerate the economic growth especially for society who are financially excluded. Therefore, DFI is needed to support entrepreneurial household business activities. These findings underscore the importance of tailored financial literacy initiatives and inclusive policies to promote broader access to digital financial services, driving socioeconomic development in Indonesia and beyond.

TI  - Understanding undergraduates' money management behaviour: a study beyond financial literacy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The money management behavior of undergraduates determines their smooth transition into adulthood. Economic, social and psychological factors also affect undergraduates' money management behavior. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how undergraduates manage and respond to economic, social and psychological factors affecting their money management behavior, and to examine whether this response changes as they make progress in their degree.
   Design/methodology/approach - Adopting a qualitative exploratory approach, this study examined Australian undergraduates as they face many challenges to their money management behavior. The data were collected using six focus group discussions, held in three Australian universities, in which 47 undergraduates participated.
   Findings - The findings have shown that their approach to manage spending, income, saving, peer relationships and stress changes as they make progress in their degree. However, they shared similar approaches to investment, followed parental money management advice and used technology for cost reduction, irrespective of the progress in their degree.
   Research limitations/implications - This study was conducted with the data collected from a relatively small sample of respondents and was limited only to undergraduates. Moreover, this study was conducted in Australia, indicating that some of the results might be specific to the Australian context.
   Practical implications - The findings of this study can be utilized by governments, financial institutions, educational institutions and parents who are interested in inculcating prudent money management behavior in undergraduates.
   Originality/value - This study extends the scope of the literature beyond financial literacy, and has shown how undergraduates respond to economic, social and psychological aspects relating to money management behavior and how these responses vary as they make progress in their degree. This study has applied a qualitative exploratory approach, in contrast to quantitative methods which have generally been applied for studies relating to undergraduates' money management behavior.

TI  - Decentring ingenuity: Calculation, intuition and atmospheres in the Bank of England's financial literacy assemblages
T2  - GEOFORUM
AB  - This article contributes to conceptualizations of financial literacy and subjectification. An important pivot for the dominant Foucauldian approach on financial subjectivity is the calculative device and the creation of informed savers and investors. The important move I make is to argue that the general conception of the calculative invoked in this literature is "ingenuity". I present an alternative approach which seeks to decentre the logical and routine aspects of the calculative. In this article, then, I seek to give more space to "intuition, affect and spontaneity", than work on calculative devices driven by logic and routine. I present the findings of ethnographic research Into "nested assemblages" at the Bank of England Museum. The example of the Bank of England museum is used to show the different levels of causality in assemblages and highlight that interactive museum displays can provide a spontaneous, embodied experience of macroeconomic forces and affective atmospheres.

TI  - Preferences for ethical intermediaries and sustainable investment decisions in micro-firms: The role of financial literacy and digital financial capability
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - This study analyses the effects of financial literacy and digital financial capabilities in shaping entrepreneurs' preferences for ethical financial intermediaries and sustainable investment decisions. Exploiting novel survey data on Italian micro-enterprises, we find that more financially literate business owners have higher preferences for intermediaries with a strong ethical stance, are more likely to make investments inspired by environmental and social criteria and have a higher awareness of sustainable financial products. Moreover, digital financial competencies are found to play a significant role in enhancing preferences for ethical intermediaries and sustainable investment decisions. Finally, we show that the beneficial effect of financial literacy is mostly direct, while the indirect effect operating through higher digital financial abilities, despite being statistically significant, impacts firms' sustainable financing and investing decisions only to a lower extent.

TI  - Augmented reality (AR)-based sharia financial literacy system (AR-SFLS): a new approach to virtual sharia financial socialization for young learners
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose This study aims to examine financial socialization based on augmented reality (AR) technology for elementary school students, which it is hoped will improve their sharia financial knowledge. Design/methodology/approach The experimental method with pre- and post-test and control groups was used to test the improvement in the young learners' sharia financial knowledge. This study used AR for sharia financial socialization on elementary school students and focused on sharia's basic concepts, which include earning money, balanced spending, borrowing, saving, investment, payment methods, financial technology and the concept of protection. Findings This study finds empirical evidence that the treatment group, who received sharia financial socialization via the AR media, increased their sharia financial knowledge to a greater extent than the control group did. Research limitations/implications This study provides encouraging evidence about the potential of sharia financial education for elementary school students using the appropriate learning strategies and media. The weakness in this study is that it was only carried out in one elementary school, with the children of middle- to upper-income parents. Further research should be undertaken at several schools with the children of parents with different income levels. Practical implications A shift in learning styles from verbal or visual to virtual encourages the use of AR-based learning media. Financial concepts can be abstract ones, and AR-based learning media is able to present intangible virtual elements so they become more concrete and tangible. Social implications The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects. One of the most severe and likely to be multiyear ahead is the financial aspect. Therefore, this research is expected to be a preparation for the younger generation as early as possible to strengthen social benefits in order to improve sharia financial literacy. Originality/value Research into the financial literacy, especially sharia financial literacy aimed at elementary school students, is still very limited. The teaching of financial literacy will be more effective if educators use the appropriate strategies and media. This study used financial socialization strategies and AR learning media that are aligned with the learning styles of young learners.

TI  - Investigation of Financial Literacy and Money Attitudes Among First-Year Undergraduate Accounting Students: A Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy-Based Coaching Intervention
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - As soon as they are admitted to a university, most students become responsible for their own finances, but because of a lack of parental supervision, they are more inclined to spend than to manage their money. A study of first-year undergraduate accounting students was conducted to examine the effects of rational emotive behavior therapy-based coaching (REBT-based coaching) intervention on their financial literacy and money attitudes. Thirty first-year undergraduates studying accounting at Nigerian public universities participated in this two-group randomized trial. About 15 first-year undergraduate accounting students participated in the online REBT-based coaching group, while 15 first-year undergraduate accounting students participated in the face-to-face control group. A repeated measures analysis of variance was performed on the study data at .05 probability level. The study found that the online REBT-based coaching intervention significantly improved the financial literacy and money attitudes of first-year undergraduate accounting students in a similar way to face-to-face REBT-based coaching intervention. The follow-up results for the online REBT-based coaching intervention I month later showed a similar trend of increasing students' financial literacy and money attitude scores similar to what was observed in the face-toface coaching group. There was no significant difference between students in the online and face-to-face modes regarding satisfaction with REBT-based coaching interventions they received. As a result of the findings, the researchers propose developing coaching approaches that can help students gain insight into their financial actions and knowledge, which will likely improve financial literacy and money attitudes in the future.

TI  - The Importance of Financial Literacy: Household's Income Mobility Measurement and Decomposition Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This study introduced income mobility analysis using pseudo-longitudinal panel data from Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) to consider the dynamic process of individual's well-being through time. Since there is no comprehensive measurement of income mobility because of its dynamic process, various income mobility indices such as Chi-square, Average Jump Index, Atkinson et al. Mobility Ratio, and Shorrocks' Mobility Index were used. These indices revealed that Filipino households' income movements are more mobile than expected, and their income status improved from 2000 to 2015. As income mobility takes place, income inequality is reduced by 91.80 percent (91.80%). Furthermore, the growth effect is the main factor of income mobility. This indicates that households took the economic opportunities from economic growth to earn more. However, income mobility due to transfer effect (transfer of income from one household to another through lottery winning and borrowing) increased when the economy is not good. The higher income mobility due to growth effect compared to transfer effect, whether the economy is good or bad, means that households learned how to use their income in savings, investments, and entrepreneurship. This is the result of a successful financial literacy program of the government wherein households realized financial stability and security.

TI  - Analysis of the Effect of Financial Literacy, Practicality, and Consumer Lifestyle on the Use of Chip-Based Electronic Money Using SEM
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Industry 4.0 trends have a significant influence on the acceleration of technology in Indonesia. The development of financial technology has shifted conventional transactions to electronic money as a means of payment with a digital system. Electronic money users in Indonesia continue to grow, while several factors affect consumer decision making to use electronic money. This study aims to analyze the effect of financial literacy, practicality, and consumer lifestyle on consumer interest in using chip-based electronic money. This research uses a quantitative approach with primary data obtained through questionnaires to chip-based electronic money users. The analytical method used is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to verify the factors that determine the indicators of the findings of interest in the use of chip-based electronic money. The study results indicate that: (a) Financial literacy has a significant positive effect on interest in using chip-based electronic money by 14.6%; (b) Financial literacy has a significant positive effect on practicality in the use of chip-based electronic money by 51.8%; (c) Practicality in the use of chip-based electronic money has a significant positive effect on consumer lifestyles by 71.3%; (d) Practicality has a significant positive effect on the use of chip-based electronic money by 25%; and (e) Consumer lifestyle has a significant positive effect on the use of chip-based electronic money by 52.8%. The study results imply that it can be used as a consideration for making monetary policy in Indonesia, dealing with the rapid growth in the use of chip-based electronic money.

TI  - The role of financial behaviour, financial literacy, and financial stress in explaining the financial well-being of B40 group in Malaysia
T2  - FUTURE BUSINESS JOURNAL
AB  - Understanding the financial well-being of lower-income group is a critical concern of any government as this group struggles most to meet up with their necessities. Despite the significance, little is known about financial well-being of low-income group. This study attempts to investigate the relationship between financial literacy, financial behaviour, financial stress, and financial well-being of B40 group in Malaysia. A total of 412 usable responses was derived from a survey in Klang Valley and analysed the data following partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) techniques. The results demonstrate that financial behaviour is the key antecedent followed by financial stress and financial literacy in predicting financial well-being. Hence, balancing between income and expenditure, managing financial stress, and increasing financial literacy would be necessary to assure financial well-being of lower-income group people. Governmental and institutional interventions are essential to equip the low-income group people with employment opportunities and financial knowledge to manage their basic living standards.

TI  - The dilemma of millennial Muslims towards financial management: an Islamic financial literacy perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to empirically investigate the pathway to financial management behavioural intentions (FMBI) from Islamic perspectives, through dimensions of Islamic financial literacy (IFL; Islamic financial knowledge [IFK], financial skills [FS] and self-efficacy [SE]) based on an extension to the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) model. Design/methodology/approachData was collected via a self-administered questionnaire by 300 millennials (Muslims) working in Malaysia. Structural equation modelling was used for data analysis purposes by using SmartPLS. FindingsThe results present the positive and significant influence of IFK on financial attitude (FA), FS on the elements of FA, subjective norm (SN), perceived behavioural control (PBC) and perceived moral obligation (PMO), SE on FA, FS on the elements of FA, SN and PBC. Furthermore, PBC and PMO were strong predictors of FMBI from an Islamic standpoint. Originality/valueThe findings successfully contribute to the theoretical extension of the TPB model via dimensions of IFL (IFK, FS and SE) as predictors of FA, SNs, PBC and PMO. Besides, this study provides some new insights of millennial Muslims concerning IFL and financial management from Islamic beliefs.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Financial Behaviour: Experimental Evidence from Rural Rwanda
T2  - ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB  - We organise a field experiment with smallholder farmers in Rwanda to measure the impact of financial literacy training on financial knowledge and behaviour. The training increased financial literacy of participants, changed their savings and borrowing behaviour and had a positive effect on the new business start-up. However, it failed to have a significant (short-term) impact on income. Using a two-stage regression framework, we identify enhanced financial literacy as one of the important factors explaining behavioural changes. We also test whether financial knowledge spillovers from trained farmers to their peers in local village banks but find no evidence for that.

TI  - The Moderating Effect of Financial Literacy on the Relationship Between Decision-Making Tools and Equity Returns in the Indian Secondary Equity Market
T2  - REVISTA FINANZAS Y POLITICA ECONOMICA
AB  - Decision-making in the complex equity market is a demanding task due to the vast amount of information available and the wide range of decision-making techniques to choose from. The financial literacy of the investors plays a prominent role in influencing their decision-making process. Though the Indian equity market is the third largest in Asia, only around 3% of Indian households invest in it. Therefore, the financial literacy level of Indian investor needs to be assessed to increase the stock market participation and earn higher returns. This study aims to determine the moderating effect of financial literacy on the relationship between the decision-making tools and equity returns in the Indian secondary equity market. The decision-making tools include fundamental company analysis, (iv) technical analysis, and (v) advocate recommendation. The data was gathered through a questionnaire survey method and via a valid sample of 436 questionnaires, the significance of the moderating effect was tested. Using the Process Macro plugin in SPSS, moderation analysis was conducted. The results reveal that financial literacy only moderated the relationship between economic analysis and equity returns.

TI  - Do fintech adoption and financial literacy improve corporate sustainability performance? The mediating role of access to finance
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Corporate sustainability performance (CSP) has recently garnered considerable traction worldwide. Adopting industry 4.0 technologies such as financial technology (Fintech) and leveraging critical organizational resources are of great importance to the sustainability and performance of firms. This study draws upon the ecological modernization theory (EMT) and resource-based view (RBV) to assess the effects of a firm's Fintech Adoption (FA) and Financial Literacy (FL) on different dimensions of its sustainability performance. We also examine the mediating role of Access to Finance (AF) in the associations among these understudied variables. Empirical data was collected from 262 firms in the Bangladeshi apparel industry, and the CB-SEM approach was employed to assess the proposed hypotheses. The findings revealed that FA and FL are significant drivers of firms' sustainability performance. Additionally, access to finance was found to have a robust mediating impact on both the fintech adoption-sustainability performance relationship and the financial literacy-sustainability performance relationship. Moreover, the findings indicated that access to finance positively spurs a firm's sustainability performance. These results are robust to several sensitivity checks. Our findings extend the EMT and RBV theories' scope by establishing FA, FL, and AF as valuable resources for firms to drive their sustainability performance. Given the dearth of primary-data-based research, our empirical study addresses the gaps in the fintech, FL, and sustainability literature and yields crucial implications for theory and practice. Our research provides managers of RMG enterprises and policymakers with a constructive model for implementing fintech and managers' FL to enhance firms' access to credit and sustainability performance.

TI  - The roles of peers and social media in building financial literacy among the millennial generation: A case of indonesian economics and business students
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - Students of the millennial generation have several characteristics, including being wasteful in their management of money and being highly dependent on information and communication technology. These phenomena mean financial literacy is important for them, in order that they become capable, wise, and efficient individuals who are future-oriented in managing their personal finances. This study aims to create a model for developing the financial management behavior of students. It covers five variables, namely financial behavior, financial attitude, financial knowledge, social media exposure, and peer influence. By using purposive sampling and a five-point Likert scale questionnaire, this study collected data from 327 students spread across several universities in Indonesia. The results of the descriptive analysis show that the students' financial management behavior (FMB), financial attitude, and financial knowledge are classified as good. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis using the single-composite indicator technique shows that 58% of FMB is influenced by financial exposure from social media, financial attitude, and peer influence. Social media exposure and peer influence take on a strategic nature. Financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial behavior are internal variables related to financial literacy. Further research would need to identify the external variables that have a potential influence on the internal variables of financial literacy.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Behaviour and Well-Being of Millennials in Poland Compared to Previous Generations: The Insights from Three Large-Scale Surveys
T2  - REVIEW OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES
AB  - There are many concerns about financial competences of Millennials. Initial research on this generation suggests that it is less financially knowledgeable and exhibits less healthy financial behaviours compared to other generations. The goal of the article is to compare Millennials to non-Millennials as a whole, as well as to other generations treated in isolation, to check whether Millennials diverge in terms of financial literacy, behaviour and well-being. To that end, this study uses three distinct datasets from three surveys conducted in 2017 and 2018 on different samples of Poles. The applied statistic tests of significant differences do not confirm that Millennials diverge from other generations with respect to financial literacy as well as behaviours related to cash management, saving and investment. However, the surveyed Millennials perform significantly less healthy credit management and insurance behaviours compared to non-Millennials. We also found that Millennials report significantly higher levels of financial well-being compared to all previous generations.

TI  - Enhancing financial literacy in children 5-12 years old using authentic learning within a school market garden programme
T2  - EDUCATION 3-13
AB  - This research aims to contribute to the literature on embedding financial literacies in a school market garden programme. It seeks to do this by using one school market gardening programme in an Australian primary education setting as a case study, exploring its role and perceived benefits in developing financial literacies in students. This research utilised a qualitative research design, adopting semi-structured interviews to allow for emerging ideas, focus groups involving parents, student cohorts and garden volunteers, and participant observation to enhance data collection for triangulation. The results show that students involved in the market garden programme had positive experiences relating to their learning of financial literacies. This article proposes several recommendations that may further develop the financial literacy learning outcomes of students. These recommendations are grouped into two main themes: (1) involving students more in the management of the programme, and (2) improved record keeping.

TI  - Customized financial literacy: a boon for universal financial inclusion of PWDs post COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE
AB  - PurposeCurrently, consumers of financial products and services have become more vulnerable to predatory financial institutions, especially in the aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, financial consumers like the persons with disabilities (PWDs) should be equipped with knowledge and skills to help them to evaluate complex financial products on offer in financial markets, especially in developing countries to avoid being victims of fraudulent lending. The purpose of this study is to establish whether customized financial literacy mediates the relationship between financial consumer protection and financial inclusion of PWDs' owned MSMEs in rural Uganda post Covid-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachSmartPLS 4.0 was used to construct the measurement and structural equation models to test whether customized financial literacy significantly mediates the relationship between financial consumer protection and financial inclusion of PWDs' owned MSMEs in rural Uganda post Covid-19 pandemic.FindingsThe results revealed a partial mediating effect of customized financial literacy in the relationship between financial consumer protection and financial inclusion of PWDs' owned MSMEs in rural Uganda post Covid-19 pandemic. Conducting customized financial literacy increases financial consumer protection by 12 percentage points to promote financial inclusion of PWDs' owned MSMEs in rural Uganda post Covid-19 pandemic.Research limitations/implicationsThis study focused only on customized financial literacy and financial consumer protection to promote universal financial inclusion of PWDs' owned MSMEs post Covid-19 pandemic. Future studies may use data collected from other vulnerable groups amongst the unbanked population in developing countries, Uganda inclusive. In addition, this study also collected only quantitative data from the selected population. Further studies can be conducted using key informant interviews and focused group discussion to get the perceptions of the PWDs on being protected from exploitation by unscrupulous financial institutions.Practical implicationsThe findings from this study can help policymakers in developing countries like Uganda to revise the existing consumer protection law to include strong clauses on protection of people with special needs like the PWDs. The law must ensure that they are not exploited by financial institutions because of their conditions. The law ought to make sure that the PWDs are educated about their rights in the financial market place and all information on financial products offered by financial institutions should be simplified and interpreted to them before they make consumption decisions.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, the present study is amongst the first few studies to provide a meticulous and unique discourse on the ever increasing role of financial literacy combined with consumer protection to reduce consumption risks within the financial markets, especially in developing countries in the aftermath of global pandemic shocks. This study uses the social learning theory, theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behaviour to elucidate how customized financial literacy can enhance consumer protection to increase financial inclusion of groups with special needs like the PWDs who have become more susceptible to exploitation by unscrupulous financial institutions in under-developed financial markets, especially in post Covid-19 pandemic.

TI  - Digital financial literacy and usage of cashless payments in Jordan: the moderating role of gender
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to examine the relationships between various components of digital financial literacy, namely, awareness, subjective knowledge, experience, the digital legal framework and skills, and their influence on the adoption of cashless payment systems among university affiliates in Jordan. It also explores the mediating role of gender in this relationship. The study integrates the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and social role theory (SRT).Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a cross-sectional survey across 34 Jordanian universities. Data from 418 participants were analyzed, focusing on factor analysis to assess the constructs' reliability and validity and to explore the moderating effects.FindingsThe findings illuminate that digital financial awareness, experience and skills are significant catalysts for using cashless payments among the targeted demographic. In contrast, the digital legal framework and subjective financial knowledge did not significantly influence cashless payment use. Additionally, gender differences emerged, highlighting a stronger association between digital financial experience and cashless payment usage for women.Originality/valueThe study's uniqueness stems from its detailed analysis of digital financial literacy's effect on cashless payment adoption in Jordan's academia, incorporating aspects like legal frameworks, awareness, and skills. It innovatively considers gender's moderating role, adding fresh insights into digital finance practices. Using the TPB and SRT, the research connects theory with Jordan's empirical data, suggesting strategies for education and policy. This work advances understanding of digital financial literacy in fostering a more inclusive digital financial system, contributing significantly to digital finance and behavioral economics literature.

TI  - HOW TO RECOGNIZE POTENTIAL SCHOOL LEADERS AMONG PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS: FRAMEWORK BASED ON FINANCIAL LITERACY LEVEL AND TYPE OF MOTIVATION
T2  - MANAGEMENT-JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY MANAGEMENT ISSUES
AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential of primary school teachers for governing roles in schools. The level of teacher's financial literacy is used as a proxy for their managerial potential - managerial competences. Using the Competence Motivation Theory as framework, the authors postulate that teachers with the higher perceived competence in financial literacy are at the same time intrinsically motivated to achieve mastery in this field. Therefore, the teacher 's perceived competence and type of motivation are combined with a set of individual and contextual determinants, highlighted in the previous research, and the framework for assessing teacher 's potential or aptness for the governing position in the school is proposed. The design of this framework is based on data collected via survey which included 954 primary school teachers from Serbia, and analysed by linear and multinomial regression and cluster analysis. The results demonstrate that teachers can be categorized into four different groups, with variable degree of their potential for the governing roles. Clusters vary according to teachers ' gender, subject they teach, location of the school, level of education and whether they are driven by extrinsic or intrinsic motivators.

TI  - The Effects of Financial Attitudes, Financial Literacy and Health Literacy on Sustainable Financial Retirement Planning: The Moderating Role of the Financial Advisor
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Financial planning for retirement is essential to ensure that people have enough money to live the lifestyle they desire when they retire. Self-employed business owners in developed countries widely do financial retirement planning. However, in Malaysia, the percentage of self-employed individuals concerned about financial retirement planning is lower than in other countries. This study aims to identify the relationship between the financial attitude, financial literacy and health literacy of self-employed individuals toward sustainable financial retirement planning in Malaysia and find out the moderating effect of the role of financial advisors. The study utilized structural equation modelling. Data were collected through a survey questionnaire and analyzed using SMART PLS 3.3. The total sample size was 416 self-employed individuals from the northern Malaysian region. The findings revealed that financial attitude and financial literacy significantly impact retirement planning. Moreover, the role of financial advisors moderates the relationship between financial attitude-financial retirement planning and financial literacy-financial retirement planning. The result of the study will fulfil the needs of self-employed individuals to plan their retirement by including the financial planning determinants needed for a well-planned retirement.

TI  - Overconfidence heuristic-driven bias in investment decision-making and performance: mediating effects of risk perception and moderating effects of financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to show how overconfidence influences the decisions and performance of individual investors trading on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), with the mediating role of risk perception and moderating role of financial literacy. Design/methodology/approach The deductive approach was used, as the research is based on the theoretical framework of behavioural finance. A questionnaire and cross-sectional design were employed for data collection from the sample of 183 individual investors trading on the PSX. Hypotheses were tested through correlation and regression analysis. The Baron and Kenny method was used to test the mediation effect of risk perception and the moderation effect of financial literacy. The results of mediation and moderation were also authenticated through the PROCESS and structural equation modelling (SEM) technique. Findings The results suggest that risk perception fully mediates the relationships between the overconfidence heuristic on the one hand, and investment decisions and performance on the other. At the same time, financial literacy appears to moderate these relationships. The results suggest that overconfidence can impair the quality of investment decisions and performance, while financial literacy and risk perception can improve their quality. Practical implications The paper encourages investors to base decisions on their financial capability and experience levels and to avoid relying on heuristics or their sentiments when making investments. It provides awareness and understanding of heuristic biases in investment management, which could be very useful for decision makers and professionals in financial institutions, such as portfolio managers and traders in commercial banks, investment banks and mutual funds. This paper helps investors to select better investment tools and avoid repeating the expensive errors that occur due to heuristic biases. They can improve their performance by recognizing their biases and errors of judgment, to which we are all prone, resulting in better investment decisions and a more efficient market. The paper also highlights the importance on relying on professional knowledge, giving it greater weight than feelings and biases. Originality/value The current study is the first to focus on links between overconfidence, financial literacy, risk perception and individual investors' decisions and performance. This article enhanced the understanding of the role that heuristic-driven bias plays in the investment management, and more importantly, it went some way towards enhancing understanding of behavioural aspects and their influence on the investment decision-making and performance in an emerging market. It also adds to the literature in the area of behavioural finance specifically the role of heuristics in investment strategies; this field is in its initial stage, even in developed countries, while, in developing countries, little work has been done.

TI  - GPT has become financially literate: Insights from financial literacy tests of GPT and a preliminary test of how people use it as a source of advice
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - We assess the ability of GPT-a large language model-to serve as a financial robo-advisor for the masses, by using a financial literacy test. Davinci and ChatGPT based on GPT-3.5 score 66% and 65% on the financial literacy test, respectively, compared to a baseline of 33%. However, ChatGPT based on GPT-4 achieves a near-perfect 99% score, pointing to financial literacy becoming an emergent ability of state-of-the-art models. We use the Judge-Advisor System and a savings dilemma to illustrate how researchers might assess advice-utilization from large language models. We also present a number of directions for future research.

TI  - How farmland circulation affects household financial vulnerability in China: The chain mediation effect of labor transfer and financial literacy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Financial vulnerability is an important issue in livelihood resilience research domain. In the context of the Farmland Property Rights Reform in rural China and the promotion of farmland circulation, this study aims to explore whether and how household financial vulnerability is affected by farmland circulation and whether its impact shows heterogeneous characteristics depending on differences in farm household characteristics and regional characteristics. To answer these questions, a theoretical and empirical study was conducted based on the latest available Chinese household survey data (N = 9,822) from 2015 to 2019, using a chain mediating effects model and group regressions. The findings showed that farmland circulation could significantly reduce household financial vulnerability (Coef.=-0.167, p<0.01) while labor transfer and financial literacy played a mediating role. That is to say, farmland circulation could indirectly reduce household financial vulnerability by affecting labor transfer and financial literacy. The heterogeneity analysis showed that farmland circulation had a stronger mitigating effect on the financial vulnerability of older "first-generation farmer" households (with heads born before the 1980's) and households in the eastern regions with higher levels of economic development, suggesting that despite the "better late than never" advantage of farmland circulation, it can lead to greater regional inequality. These findings not only advance our understanding of how farmland circulation is associated with financial vulnerability but also provide some implications for the government's continuous optimization of the Farmland Property Rights Reform to ensure the financial security of farming households.

TI  - The Impact of Marketing Communication and Islamic Financial Literacy on Islamic Financial Inclusion and MSMEs Performance: Evidence from Halal Tourism in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The development of halal tourism in Indonesia is the focus of the Indonesian government and MSMEs have an important role in supporting the development of halal tourism in Indonesia. This study aims to examine the relationship between marketing communication and Islamic financial literacy on Islamic financial inclusion and MSME performance in the halal-tourism sector. A covariance-based SEM technique utilizing LISREL software was used to analyze the data from this investigation. Nonprobability sampling was employed to collect the data, and the sample consists of 152 halal-tourism entrepreneurs. This study found a positive and significant association between Islamic financial inclusion and business performance. This study also found that there is a positive and significant association between Islamic financial literacy and Islamic financial inclusion. Marketing communication and Islamic financial inclusion have a positive relationship, but it is insignificant. This study implies that to establish a halal-tourist ecosystem for long-term development in Indonesia, commercial actors must lend their full support. This study demonstrates that they can thrive when MSMEs in the halal-tourist ecosystem are backed by Islamic banking and Islamic rural banks. As a result, a more accommodating approach from Islamic banking is required to provide access to halal finance for business actors in Indonesia's halal-tourism ecosystem.

TI  - Developing the capability of digital financial literacy in developing countries: A Case of online loan for small entrepreneurs
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - The rapid growth of digital financial services especially during the COVID-19 outbreak, is a factor accelerating the use of online loan applications that inevitably require the knowledge of digital finance. This study used the behavior change theory and digital financial literacy to identify relevant and correlated variables to confirm positive motivational factors on digital financial skills and capability. Structure equation modeling (SEM) and path analysis were applied to find the correlation and confirm the proposed hypotheses presented. There were 400 samples of small entrepreneurs from different provinces, and online questionnaires were used for data collection. The findings showed that the knowledge and motivation variables were related and had a positive effect. It contributes to continuously building up the skills and capabilities of small entrepreneurs who need to develop their capabilities in digital financial literacy adequately in line with the changes in business and technology after the outbreak of COVID-19. This concept can apply to online loan policy for small entrepreneurs trained with motivating courses who accepted digital finance literacy's usefulness.

AB  - The increasing complexity of financial products and services requires a domain of information and knowledge in the financial area. This study explores the role of financial literacy in undergraduate students at a higher education institution in Portugal. A sample of 196 undergraduate students enrolled in six courses in the fields of engineering and social sciences was considered. The results reveal that the level of knowledge about financial literacy is quite heterogeneous. Formal and informal channels tend to coexist when they perform a financial decision. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the awareness of cryptocurrencies is high, while the adherence to digital platforms for the acquisition of these currencies remains low.

TI  - Financial Literacy and the Impact of Movement Control Order (MCO) Among the Muslim Mompreneurs A Qualitative Study
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ECONOMICS-TUJISE
AB  - This empirical paper investigates how the mompreneurs manage their businesses during the Covid-19 lockdown and how the pandemic affects their family. The role of a mother in a family encompasses the livelihood of the family members, which extends to the family's financial standing. A mother's role in a family ranges from a homemaker and, to a certain extent, a financial provider. In Malaysia, it was reported in 2018 that 60.2% of entrepreneurs are housewives. However, it is believed that many women are working at and from home with high cost of living, especially in urban areas. They become home-based entrepreneurs, especially during this unprecedented pandemic, i.e. Covid-19, and restricted by the Movement Control Order (MCO). This study adopted an exploratory qualitative study whereby six (6) mompreneurs who are operating their businesses from home were interviewed to understand how the pandemic and the lockdown have affected their lives. This paper further examines their coping mechanism to the pandemic and financial income during this crisis. Mompreneurs' financial literacy is also observed in this paper to explore their financial understanding. This research is an exploratory study, and it only provides general ideas on how a home-based businesswoman survive and cope during the lockdown. The findings from this paper are suitable to be used as a benchmark for an extensive quantitative study in the future to further understand the behaviour of the mompreneurs, especially in Malaysia.

TI  - Financial Literacy of Managers in Serbian Health Care Organizations as a Path to Sustainability
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Adequate financial management is of great importance to the health care system. In the contemporary state of affairs, health care is facing numerous limitations due to drastic costs and growing pressures to provide quality health care. In such appalling conditions, the managers of health organizations must build skills and knowledge that go beyond the comfort zone of their clinical competencies. It is necessary to develop their leadership skills. Bearing in mind the importance of financial competencies, the general aim of this paper is to determine the competencies of the managers of Serbian health institutions (private and public sector) in this area. Insufficient attention has been given to how health care organizations' financial literacy affects their sustainability. For the purpose of this prospective research, a questionnaire was created that surveyed the managers of various health care institutions. The results of this study indicated that managers of health organizations have a relatively modest level of financial knowledge. However, they participate in financial activities to a large extent. This gap between the function they perform and the knowledge they have can potentially harm the well-being of the health care organizations they lead. Managers of organizations in the public sector showed a more active role in the development of business plans and more frequent independent decision making, while managers of organizations in the private sector gave more importance to financial control, negotiation, and internal financial reporting, for the improvement of the management process.

TI  - Screening Financial Literacy in Young Business-Oriented Professionals. Conjectures of Financial Duality and Financial Divergence
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The main purpose of this research is the estimation and analysis of the level of Financial Literacy of professionals oriented to business management. The sample was composed of young executives starting MBA studies. The level of FL was analyzed in detail through various statistical techniques, under two perspectives. The first perspective referred to the dimensions involved in the definition of FL and the second referred to the demographic characteristics of the population. Theresults show a level of FL that does not reach an acceptable minimum in its global measurement; neither in its different dimensions, but the Information dimension. In general terms, this result is reproduced at the different demographic segments analyzed. In terms of the demographic categories, there were no differences in age or gender. Based on the income level, there were differences in the Knowledge and Information dimensions. Likewise, based on the number of dependents and on profession, there were differences in the Consciousness dimension. The results allow us to make two important conjectures for further research: the Financial Duality and the Financial Divergence conjectures. It is postulated that the Financial Duality conjecture could be explained through Kahneman's theory of System 1/System 2 and corresponding behavioral biases.

TI  - Catch them young: Impact of financial socialization, financial literacy and attitude towards money on financial well-being of young adults
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - A stream of research has examined the financial well-being of individuals. However, less research has been conducted on the financial well-being of young adults in developing economies. To further examine this domain, we developed a conceptual framework based on the existing literature of consumer research and financial well-being and assessed how financial literacy, socialization and attitude towards money influence the financial well-being of young adults. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted on 446 young adults (preliminary study n = 156; main study n = 290; mean age 22 years) in India. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that financial discussion with parents during childhood positively influences financial well-being of young adults. In addition, we found that relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being is not significant. Furthermore, the study reveals the role of attitude towards money as a strong predictor of financial well-being. The results provide implications for educational and financial institutions and policymakers for improving the financial well-being of young adults.

TI  - The interplay of skills, digital financial literacy, capability, and autonomy in financial decision making and well-being
T2  - BORSA ISTANBUL REVIEW
AB  - Covid-19 and the unprecedented surge in financial technology contributed to unexpected financial challenges, affecting the relevance of financial decision making and perceived financial well-being. This paper examines the mediating effects of digital financial literacy, financial autonomy, financial capability, and impulsivity on financial decision making and perceived financial well-being. The data come from 512 re-spondents in Delhi/NCR (National Capital Region), India, using a snowball-sampling technique and partial least squares structural equation modeling to test 13 structural hypotheses with SmartPLS3.3. Partial least squares (PLS) prediction is employed to estimate the out-of-sample predictive power of the proposed model. Our findings reveal that skills directly affect financial decision making and perceived financial well-being, and digital financial literacy emerges as a direct and mediating predictor of financial decision making. The dominance of financial capability and financial autonomy as mediators in financial decision making and financial well-being become more evident, and impulsivity fails to have mediating effects on financial decision making. The results have academic, regulatory, and managerial implications, all of which calls for more concerted efforts at recognizing the unique interaction among skills-financial decision making-perceived financial well-being, the cu-mulative effect of which enhances the critical ability to deal with environmental challenges, manage socioeconomic pressures in a sustainable manner, and translate the benefits into prudent gender-specific policy decisions and practices.Copyright (c) 2022 Borsa Istanbul Anonim S , irketi.

TI  - Impact of behavioral biases on investment decisions and the moderation effect of financial literacy; an evidence of Pakistan
T2  - ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA
AB  - Th is study offers empirical insights into investor behavior and its correlation with various behavioral biases in the context of investment decisions in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). Data was collected through a structured questionnaire from 261 individual investors in Pakistan. The study employs hierarchical regression analysis to test the hypothesis. It considers several behavioral biases, and statistically, anchoring and adjustment, overconfidence, and herding show a significant impact. The study uses financial literacy to examine its moderating effects on these biases, and the result suggests that it significantly influences behavioral biases related to investment decisions. The results underscore the unique investment behaviors in emerging markets, contrasting with established norms in well-developed financial markets. These findings can inform policymakers and stock market authorities about investor decision-making in emerging economies.

TI  - The influence of CEO's financial literacy on SMEs technological innovation: the mediating effects of MCS and risk-taking
T2  - FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB  - Previous literature showed mixed results about the impact of CEOs' financial literacy (CFL) on small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) innovation. This relationship can be motivated by relevant variables, which are missing in the previous literature and make a difference as mediators. In this sense, based on the theoretical framework related to upper echelon theory and resource-based view, this study focuses on the mediating effect of risk-taking attitude and management control systems (MCS) variables. Empirical data from 310 SMEs gathered using a qualitative research questionnaire are analyzed using structural equation modeling methodology. Specifically, estimations are carried out considering the partial least square method. Findings show that MCS and managers' risk attitudes fully mediate the relationship between financial literacy (FL) and innovation. Between these two mediating variables, the implementation of MCS stands out because it also enables the mediating effect of CEOs' risk-taking in the CFL-technological innovation relationship. As the results do not support the significant direct relationship between FL and risk attitude, they confirm an indirect effect through MCS. Furthermore, based on the study findings, SMEs' directors and owners, business associations, and public authorities can improve SMEs' technological innovation by implementing training programs and policies to foster CFL. They can also acknowledge the interdependency between organizational factors and individual characteristics to enhance SMEs' technological innovation.

TI  - Financial literacy in for-profit vs pro-social peer-to-peer lending
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending facilitates direct online lending and aims to provide financial inclusion and investment returns. Lender goals range from for-profit to pro-social and objective information is limited, which highlights the need to examine heuristics. Design/methodology/approach This study examines 1,347 lending decisions by finance students on a mock P2P site. Testimonials were used to randomly condition the financially literate lenders towards for-profit or pro-social decision-making. Each investor evaluated three loans. The three loan applications were identical except for a female or male headshot (vs an icon) and random reports of 50% funding for the female or male loan in 3 days (vs 11 days for opposite gender and 7 for icon). Previous research surveys students on a mock platform (Gonzalez, 2020) and reports similar heuristics and lifelike decisions in student and general population samples (Gonzalez and Komarova, 2014). Findings Lenders randomly conditioned towards pro-social lending state lower trust in borrowers. However, pro-social investors state lower risk in P2P lending and higher financial literacy. Second, pro-social investors are more confident when lending to borrowers highly trusted by other lenders, especially if the popular loan applicant is female. Third, pro-social conditioning increases lending to male applicants when the popular loan applicant is female. Fourth, pro-social investors who have experienced financial trauma have greater confidence in bad loan recovery. Originality/value This is the first study of heuristics in pro-social vs for-profit P2P lending. In addition, it shows that testimonials can effectively condition lending goals and affect trust and risk perceptions.

TI  - The impact of carbon pricing, climate financing, and financial literacy on COVID-19 cases: go-for-green healthcare policies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Climate finance and carbon pricing are regarded as sustainable policy mechanisms for mitigating negative environmental externalities via the development of green financing projects and the imposition of taxes on carbon pollution generation. Financial literacy indicates that it is beneficial to invest in cleaner technology to advance the environmental sustainability goal. The current wave of the COVID-19 epidemic has had a detrimental effect on the world economies' health and income. The pandemic crisis dwarfs previous global financial crises in terms of scope and severity, collapsing global financial markets. The study's primary contribution is constructing a climate funding index (CFI) based on four critical factors: inbound foreign direct investment, renewable energy usage, research and development spending, and carbon damages. In a cross-sectional panel of 43 nations, the research evaluates the effect of climate funding, financial literacy, and carbon pricing in lowering exposure to coronavirus cases. The study utilized Newton-Raphson and Marquardt steps to estimate the current parameter estimates while evaluating the COVID-19 prediction model with level regressors using the robust least squares regression model (S-estimator). Additionally, the innovation accounting matrix predicts estimations over a specific period. The findings indicate that climate finance significantly reduces coronavirus exposure by introducing green financing initiatives that benefit human health, which eventually strengthens the immune system's ability to fight infectious illnesses. Financial literacy and carbon pricing, on the other hand, are ineffectual in controlling coronavirus infections due to rising economic activity and densely inhabited areas that enable the transmission of coronavirus cases across countries. Similar findings were obtained using the alternative regression apparatus. The COVID-19 predicted variable was used as a "response variable," and climate financing was shown to have a favorable impact on containing coronavirus exposure. As shown by the innovation accounting matrix, carbon pricing would drastically decrease coronavirus cases' exposure over a time horizon. The study concludes that climate finance and carbon pricing were critical in improving air quality indicators, which improved countries' health and wealth, allowing them to reduce coronavirus infections via sustainable healthcare reforms.

TI  - An Assessment Tool to Identify the Financial Literacy Level of Financial Education Programs Participants' Executed by Ecuadorian Financial Institutions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Due to the lack of a tool assessing the effectiveness of Financial Education Programs (FEP) imparted by the financial institutions (FI) in Ecuador by mandate, this research proposes and validates a scale to evaluate the Financial Literacy (FL) level of 314 participants (15-50 years old) after attending an FEP. The final 18-item FL scale, compounded with Financial Attitude, Financial Knowledge, and Financial Behavior dimensions, is reliable and robust according to the Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The average score for FL is 76 out of 100 points. The youngest scored the lowest, and the FI employees the highest. This contribution fulfills a needed FL scale to accurately measure the efforts of FI spreading the FE. It serves as a stepping stone for further research reconfirming its validity and applying the proposed FI's FL scale as a pre-post FL evaluation.

TI  - THE EFFECTS OF PERCEIVED AND ACTUAL FINANCIAL LITERACY ON FINANCIAL BEHAVIORS
T2  - ECONOMIC INQUIRY
AB  - A combined measure of financial literacy that includes both a test score of actual financial literacy and a self-rating of overall financial literacy is used in this study. We find that the combined measure appears to provide greater understanding about how financial literacy affects financial behaviors. A large national survey of U.S. adults and households (n=28,146) was used to investigate how this overall financial literacy is likely to change financial behaviors across five financial topics: credit cards, investments, loans, insurance, and financial advice. For each topic, we include 4-5 financial behaviors (22 in total) to demonstrate the consistency of the findings within and across topics. Although we are unable to identify a causal relationship, the results from the probit analysis show that both actual and perceived financial literacy appear to influence financial behaviors and that perceived financial literacy may be as important as actual financial literacy.

TI  - Examining the Impact of Financial Literacy, Financial Self-Control, and Demographic Determinants on Individual Financial Performance and Behavior: An Insight from the Lebanese Crisis Period
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study investigated the effects of financial literacy, financial self-control, and demographic determinants on individual financial performance and behavior during the Lebanese crisis period between 2019 and 2021. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first study that compares the determinants of financial behavior for different generations, genders, marital statuses, and education and income levels. To do so, we conducted a comprehensive survey of 328 individuals and performed a logistic regression analysis. The empirical results show that an individual's financial performance and behavior are positively affected by financial literacy, financial self-control, and demographic factors, in particular education and income levels. In addition, when we focused on the demographic factors, the results reveal that having good financial literacy increases the likelihood of an individual's financial performance and behavior, in particular for Generations X and Z, males and females, single and married people, low- and high-educated people, and low- and high-income individuals. However, having good financial self-control only increases the likelihood of an individual's financial performance and behavior at highly educated levels. The results are robust and come from various performed methodologies, and the results have important policy implications. The policies should be focused on enhancing an individual's financial behavior and helping young adults acquire skills in self-control. Policies could also motivate local financial institutions to offer a variety of financial products and investment opportunities, targeting low-income and low-educated individuals, by providing subsidized funds with parallel mandatory financial studies.

TI  - Nexus between Chat GPT usage dimensions and investment decisions making in Pakistan: Moderating role of financial literacy
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - This study's primary goal is to investigate and gain better knowledge of the relationship between ChatGPT usage dimensions such as analyzing data, managing risk, optimizing portfolios, forecasting market trends, and conducting sentiment analysis and investment decisions of investors in the Pakistan stock market, as well as the moderating role of financial literacy. The sample for this study included individual stock market investors in Pakistan. Using a self-administered questionnaire and a cross-sectional design, a non-probability convenience sampling technique followed by snowball techniques was used to collect data from 388 active and potential individual investors. The study's findings showed that ChatGPT usage dimensions have a positive and significant impact on investment decision making. Furthermore, financial literacy is found to moderate the relationship between optimizing portfolios, forecasting market trends, and investment decision making. The study's findings outlined practical implications for the researcher, financial advisors, individual investors, governmental decision-makers, policymakers, and stock market authorities who are interested in leveraging the benefits of artificial intelligence and machine learning in investment decision making in the context of emerging economies like Pakistan.

TI  - Financial literacy as a determinant of market participation: New evidence from China using IV-GMM
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - We analyze the relationship between financial literacy (FL) and market participation among Chinese households. Our ordinary least square (OLS) regression results show that advanced FL is statistically positively related to market participation. Because of endogeneity concerns between FL and market participation, researchers have challenged OLS results for their bias and incon-sistency. We consider the instrumental variable estimator using the generalized method of mo-ments (IV-GMM) that aims to remedy endogeneity issue. We perform the Hansen J test of over-identification restrictions to ensure that the excluded instruments are appropriately independent of the error process. The IV-GMM estimates show that individuals with a higher advanced FL score are more likely to invest in stock markets. Specifically, with an additional one point of the advanced FL score, the probability of market participation will increase by about 12% points. We also perform robustness tests using different model specifications and different FL measures. Results are consistent with the main finding that advanced FL is positively related to market participation. Based on the results of the IV-GMM, we conclude that individuals with a higher level of advanced FL are more likely to participate in stock markets.

TI  - Financial literacy and fraud detection*
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - Who is better at detecting fraud? This paper finds that more financially knowledgeable individuals have a higher propensity to detect fraud: a one standard deviation increase in financial knowledge increases fraud detection probabilities by 3 percentage points. The result is not driven by individuals' higher financial product usage and is observed to be moderated by individuals' low subjective well-being, effectively depleting skills to detect fraud. Interestingly, prudent financial behavior relating to basic money management is found to have negligible effects for detecting fraud. The findings attest to the fact that fraud tactics are increasingly complex and it is greater financial knowledge rather than basic money management skills that provide the degree of sophistication necessary to detect fraud. The paper draws policy implications for consumer education programs to go beyond cultivating money management skills, and provide advanced financial knowledge necessary for tackling fraud.

TI  - Determinants of financial literacy of young adults: testing the influence of parents and socio-demographic variables
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Acquiring good financial literacy (FL) can be very helpful for a young adult, as it may allow for making informed choices and long-term financial decisions. The research evidence suggests that in general people are less financially literate, which becomes an impediment to making the right form of savings, investment, retirement planning and other such important decisions. The objective of the study is to identify what determines the level of FL of young adults undertaking a management program in India. This study, in addition, examines the effect of parental influence by including three facets of it; namely, parents direct teaching, parents' financial behaviour and parents as role models. Notably, parents' influence is a significant determinant of FL. Among other factors, higher FL was found for male respondents, those with more educated mother, and finance majors.

This study provides theoretical support for evaluating the development level of inclusive finance in "Belt and Road" countries, promoting the development of inclusive finance and alleviating the problem of financial exclusion.Originality/valueThis study is original as it creates a research paradigm for "Belt and Road" countries, enabling systematic testing and comparative analysis of inclusive finance development. It incorporates traditional and digital services, evaluating them based on sharing, fairness, convenience and specific group benefits. An inclusive financial index is constructed using the coefficient of variation and arithmetic weighted average methods. Additionally, it introduces a more rational analysis approach for the influence mechanism and spatial effect, using an economic geography nested matrix and spatial Durbin model to explore spatial effects in inclusive finance.

TI  - Are business students more financially literate? Evidence of differences in financial literacy amongst Portuguese college students
T2  - YOUNG CONSUMERS
AB  - Purpose Considering the importance of financial literacy (FL) in people's lives the goal of this study aims to assess the level of FL of young Portuguese students, addressing the impact of the level of education on the FL of college students. Design/methodology/approach Data from a non-probabilistic sample of 185 students attending higher education bachelor's and master's degrees courses in Economics, Management and Marketing was collected between February 25 and March 23, 2019, using an online questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed using IBM SPSS 25 to analyze the data. Findings The findings show that the level of the degree (bachelor's or master's degree) and the academic background of the individual's parents have a positive impact on FL. Moreover, among individuals with a high level of FL, gender and professional situation are additional predictors. Furthermore, the authors observed that the level of FL of Portuguese students attending higher education is overall low, especially in terms of their knowledge of the main financial concepts, which may call for public policies to be implemented so that to reduce this vulnerability. Research limitations/implications Among limitations is the limited sample collected, restricted to a particular target, Portuguese students attending business-related courses such as Economics, Management and Marketing, either studying for a master's or bachelor's degree. This issue restricts the generalization of the overall findings to other students studying different fields. Future studies can collect a random and representative sample. Practical implications This study test can be replicated to generate a diagnosis in any region or country, identifying how financially literate the region under analysis is. Also, this can be done to verify the evolution of FL after educational interventions. Social implications FL is an important competence. In fact, youngsters in the whole world have been suffering from a lack of financial knowledge (FK), and some characteristics of them can push them into indebtedness, and, even bankruptcy, such as a higher level of status consumption, the tendency to have an attitude of self-appraisal, to be self-centered, to seek instant gratification. This study helps to lead to a better understanding of this phenomenon. Originality/value Addressing college students attending different levels is an add-on to the existing body of literature. This paper contributes to study differences in FL between college and master students, enlightening and evaluating the role of scholarship maturity on financial education. Furthermore, some of the findings challenge the extant knowledge regarding the influence of professional experience, gender and age on the level of FK that students have. Finally, the current approach is innovative as it addresses FK, FL and numeracy in the same study.

TI  - Examining Islamic capital market adoption from a socio-psychological perspective and Islamic financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore the Islamic capital market adoption model, based on the construct of Islamic financial literacy (IFL), the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and past behavior (PBR) in the context of a Muslim-majority country (Indonesia). Design/methodology/approach To test the conceptual model, this study used data from 251 respondents with a diverse spectrum, and the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique was used to test the forecasting of the model. Findings Overall, IFL and TPB dimensions (i.e. attitudes and perceived behavioral control) have a significant positive effect, either directly or indirectly, for investment intentions in the Islamic capital market. Also, the findings recommend the construct of PBR as an important predictor of investment intentions in Islamic capital markets. Practical implications The study can be beneficially used for Islamic financial institutions to participate with the Indonesian government in affirming IFL to broader society, not only Islamic education institutions. It is related to the significance of IFL, where it can be utilized as an indicator that education on the concept and values of Islamic finance can positively establish attitudes in society and stakeholders. Originality/value This study is an effort to strengthen IFL as a key construct using a good measurement scale, in the context of the Islamic capital market investment. In addition, this study also provides the necessary impetus to analyze the relationship between the dimensions of TPB and PBR, either directly or indirectly.

TI  - Design and Evaluation among Young Adults of a Financial Literacy Scale Focused on Key Financial Decisions
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - The present study underpins the design and validation of a Financial Literacy (FL) scale in the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) context. Though scales are available, they do not meet contextual characteristics and seem to miss out on a focus on Key Financial Decisions (KFD). Scale design was consistent with an extensive literature review (2010-2021). Forty-four items scale covering the dimensions of Financial Attitude, Financial Behavior, and Financial Knowledge were presented to 478 young adults aged 18-30, and women 58% of them. The results reflect a robust FL scale by applying Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The data about young adults' FL can be used as a benchmark in future studies fostering the development of FL in the Latin American and Caribbean contexts.

TI  - How Does Financial Literacy Affect Digital Entrepreneurship Willingness and Behavior-Evidence from Chinese Villagers' Participation in Entrepreneurship
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - How financial literacy (FL) can contribute to both digital entrepreneurship (DE) willingness and behavior has become a widely concerned and controversial topic among scholars and practitioners, one that is particularly relevant for bottom of pyramid (BOP) entrepreneurs. However, existing literature has not established a systematic theoretical framework for this issue, and its internal mechanism has not been thoroughly revealed. Hence, based on behavioral finance theory and digital business-related literature, we construct a multi-layer linear and mediated-moderation model that relates latent variables of FL, financial inclusion (FI), digital literacy (DL), and DE. A total of 664 villagers carrying out DE are the sample from China, and the empirical results mainly reveal the following: FL significantly improves the DE willingness and behavior, and the sense of FI plays a partial mediating role between FL and DE willingness and behavior. DL is a crucial influencing factor that moderates a positive effect between FL and DE willingness and behavior. Moreover, DL plays a mediated-moderating role. By contrast, FL in poverty-stricken counties (PSC) has a more substantial influence on DE than that in non-poverty-stricken counties (NPSC). If the family background (social capital) is superior (excellent), and the resources are abundant, then the influence of FL on DE will be stronger. This research contributes to the theories and practices related to FL, DE, FI, and DL.

TI  - Does Islamic financial literacy and motives influence the holdings of Islamic financial products? A study on bank customers in Klang Valley, Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING
AB  - PurposeIn a dual financial system where both conventional and Islamic financial institutions co-exist, the motives behind customers' choices of financial products remain a crucial factor to comprehend. Thus, this paper aims to examine the influence of Islamic financial literacy (IFL) and motives (religious, ethical and economic) on the holdings of Islamic financial products (IFPs).Design/methodology/approachThe sample consists of 234 bank customers in Klang Valley, Malaysia, with data obtained through a convenience sampling method. The instrument used was a digital survey that was electronically sent to respondents.FindingsFindings reveal that IFL and religious motives positively influence IFPs, whereas economic motives negatively influence IFPs. Ethical motives have no significant impact on IFPs.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings imply that IFPs attract customers due to their adherence to Islamic teachings, indicating strong religious motives. However, the negative leanings of the economic motive suggest that customers may perceive IFPs as less favourable due to higher costs and risks relative to conventional products. Islamic financial institutions must widen their efforts in educating the public regarding IFPs on the benefits of adherence to Shariah principles and at the same time improve their products' cost-benefits.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the literature by comprehensively examining IFPs in terms of both assets and financing products. In addition, IFL is measured in an all-inclusive way, covering different dimensions of knowledge related to Islamic savings, investments, protection and financing.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Retirement Spending: A University Student Perspective
T2  - AUSTRALIAN ACCOUNTING REVIEW
AB  - Financial provision for retirement consists of two phases, accumulation and decumulation. Young people as an age group have generally been ignored in previous research and there has been little research investigating financial literacy levels of young people and attitudinal aspects of their decision making. As such, this paper examines university students' views on decumulation. We find that student predictions of their costs in retirement are inaccurate, and this is driven by overconfidence and somewhat mitigated by better financial literacy. Furthermore, when planning for retirement income, the Age Pension is expected to be used the least while interestingly personal savings are expected to be used more than superannuation. The biggest drivers of the different levels of usage for the different funding sources are opinions on the effectiveness and understanding of superannuation. These results demonstrate that there is a lack of understanding of the costs of living and the characteristics of the different pillars of the Australian retirement system. Increasing skills and knowledge in financial literacy and of the Australian retirement system is paramount. The implications of our findings are of interest to government, finance professionals and academics from an education and research perspective.

TI  - Personal finance blogs: Helpful tool for consumers with low financial literacy or preaching to the choir?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Recent transitions from defined benefit to defined contribution plans assign greater individual responsibility to consumers to prepare for retirement and make consequential financial choices. However, many consumers are ill-equipped to do so, considering overall low levels of financial literacy. At the same time, there is increasing controversy about the effectiveness of traditional financial education, such as high school financial education, counselling and seminars or workshops. Alternative sources of (just-in-time) financial training or advice may be needed to financially empower consumers and help them make important financial decisions. In the light of these developments, this study investigates if consumers perceive personal finance blogs as a helpful alternative in acquiring financial knowledge, and which factors influence perceived helpfulness of and intention to use personal finance blogs. Using Structural Equation Modelling to analyse data from a sample of U.S. consumers, the results of this study uncover that financial literacy and susceptibility to informational influence have a significant positive association with perceived helpfulness. Perceived financial uncertainty, which refers to uncertainty in terms of consumers' perceived ability to accurately predict their future financial needs, has a significant negative association with perceived helpfulness of and intention to use personal finance blogs. Finally, perceived helpfulness of a personal finance blog is a significant positive predictor of consumers' intention to use it. Overall, the findings suggest that personal finance blogs are preaching to the choir, since the consumers who are most likely to use personal finance blogs seem to need them the least given their higher levels of financial literacy and lower levels of perceived financial uncertainty. Taken together, the findings shed light on the potential users of personal finance blogs and underline the challenges of a one-size-fits-all' financial education. This study aids in assessing personal finance blogs as an online resource which is scarcely researched, but which has the potential to provide just-in-time financial education to consumers across the world.

TI  - Libraries and financial literacy
T2  - REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW
AB  - Purpose The recent financial crises and the economic problems caused by the pandemic highlight the importance of financial literacy (FL). Libraries have an essential role in developing informational literacy and promoting access to information. In this study the authors seek to identify, based on the published literature, in which areas and in what roles libraries engage in the development of FL, and what options are available for those who intend to set out in this direction in the near future. Design/methodology/approach The basis of the research is a review of the literature, as comprehensive as possible, achieved by keyword- and discipline-focused searches run in the Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts (LISTA), the Web of Science (WoS) and the Scopus database. At the beginning of the study, the initial list of results had 765 publications, but this number decreased significantly after removing duplicates and sorting the results. Finally, 138 publications were included in the analysis. Findings Libraries engage in the development of FL mostly through their collections, with recommendations, through education, by organizing programs and through information service. Most successful methods do not require any specialized FL knowledge from librarians. Necessary competences are more related to organizational skills, cooperation with partners and creativity. Research limitations/implications The study is based on publications which include the term financial culture, any of its synonyms, or broader or more specific terms and which are related to libraries in the manner described in the search strategy. The international literature databases chosen for the searches limited the scope of the articles available for inclusion. Originality/value The study summarizes the results in libraries related to FL from the past 10 years. There has been no other similar summary published recently applicable in practice.

TI  - Do Access to Finance, Technical Know-How, and Financial Literacy Offer Women Empowerment Through Women's Entrepreneurial Development?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The motivation of the study is to gauge the effects of access to finance, technical know-how, and financial literacy on women's empowerment through establishing women's entrepreneurial development. A sample of 950 women-owned SMEs was considered, and structured questionnaires were sent from getting target responses. After careful assessment through the data cleansing procedure, it was found that only 795 responses are suitable for further investigation, implying the sample response rate for the study is 74.71%. The study implemented structural equation modeling and multivariate regression analysis for gauging the causal association that is direct and indirect effects of target variables. According to findings, a positive statistically significant linkage was revealed with women's entrepreneurship sustainability and women empowerment. Furthermore, the mediating effects were also established for women's empowerment. According to the study findings, it is suggested that for women entrepreneurship sustainability, effective policies surrounding financing accessibility, technical knowledge expansion, and financial understating have to be promulgated in the economy, which allows bringing women empowerment at large.

TI  - Financial literacy and financial well-being of Australian consumers: a moderated mediation model of impulsivity and financial capability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose This study aims to test a moderated mediation model for a twofold purpose. First, to examine the mediating role of financial capability (FC) in the association between financial literacy (FL) and financial well-being (FW). Second, to analyze if non-impulsive future-oriented behavior (NIB) moderates the associations of FL with FC and FL with FW. Design/methodology/approach The authors use the PROCESS macros in IBM SPSS Statistics to test the moderated mediation model and analyze the 2016 wave of the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia Survey. Findings The empirical analysis shows that FC partially mediates the association between FL and FW. Furthermore, the moderated mediation analysis shows that NIB strengthens the associations of FL with FC and FL with FW. Specifically, the positive associations of FL with FC and FL with FW significantly increase for those consumers who score high on NIB. Practical implications The findings have implications for the financial services industry. Professional financial planners can positively improve the ability of consumers to deal with their financial matters by highlighting the importance of FL and NIB. Social implications The study findings suggest educating consumers to discourage impulsive behavior and encourage them to create financial plans as it will enhance their ability to conduct financial tasks efficiently, improving their FW. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to assess a moderated mediation model, which examines the role of FC as a mediator variable and NIB as a moderator variable in the association between FL and FW.

TI  - Financial literacy and financial sophistication in the older population
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Using a special-purpose module implemented in the Health and Retirement Study, we evaluate financial sophistication in the American population over the age of 50. We combine several financial literacy questions into an overall index to highlight which questions best capture financial sophistication and examine the sensitivity of financial literacy responses to framing effects. Results show that many older respondents are not financially sophisticated: they fail to grasp essential aspects of risk diversification, asset valuation, portfolio choice, and investment fees. Subgroups with notable deficits include women, the least educated, non-Whites, and those age 75+. In view of the fact that retirees increasingly must take on responsibility for their own retirement security, such meager levels of knowledge have potentially serious and negative implications.

TI  - Knowledge creates value: the role of financial literacy in entrepreneurial behavior
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Under the backdrop of economic globalization and the digital economy, entrepreneurial behavior has emerged not only as a focal point of management research but also as an urgent topic within the domain of family finance. This paper scrutinizes the ramifications of financial literacy on household entrepreneurial behavior utilizing data from China's sample of the China Household Finance Survey spanning the years 2015 and 2017. Employing the ordered Probit model, we pursue our research objectives. Our findings suggest that financial literacy exerts immediate, persistent, and evolving positive effects on households' engagement in entrepreneurial activities and their proclivity toward entrepreneurship. Through the mitigation of endogeneity in the regression model, the outcomes of the two-stage regression corroborate the primary regression results. An examination of heterogeneity unveils noteworthy disparities between urban and rural areas, as well as gender discrepancies, in how financial literacy influences household entrepreneurial behavior. Furthermore, this study validates three potential pathways-namely income, social network, and risk attitude channels-demonstrating that financial literacy significantly augments household income, expands social networks, and enhances risk attitudes. Moreover, through supplementary analysis, we ascertain that financial education amplifies the impact of financial literacy on entrepreneurial behavior. Our study contributes to the enrichment of human capital theory and modern entrepreneurship theory. It advocates for robust efforts by governments and financial institutions to widely disseminate financial knowledge and foster family entrepreneurship, thereby fostering the robust and stable operation of both the global financial market and the job market.

TI  - Do trust in financial institution and financial literacy enhances intention to participate in stock market among Indian investors during COVID-19 pandemic?
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This research aims to investigate the significance of trust in financial institution and financial literacy in the investment decision-making of individual investors during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigates the strength of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in this framework. This study considered a structured questionnaire to collect data from 460 individual investors of different districts in four states of India. For testing the research hypotheses, SPSS and PLS-SEM were taken into consideration. The findings enlighten that elements of TPB, i.e. attitude (ATT) and subjective norms (SNs), are significantly associated with investment intentions (INT) while perceived behavioral control (PBC) displays an insignificant association with INT. Furthermore, along with the original components of the TPB model, Trust in financial institution (TFI) and Financial Literacy (FL) were also incorporated in the model, which shows a significant affect on investors' intention to invest in the stock market. The results stated that TFI is the most significant factor that enhances investors' intention to participate in stock market during COVID-19 pandemic. The study describes that during the phase of uncertainty like COVID-19 pandemic trust is the most important factor that enhances investors' participation in the stock market. Authors suggest SEBI and other financial institutions should promote trust and trusting behavior in financial institutions as it is significant not only from the perspective of financial development but also to empower the individuals to gain from institutional services as well as to guard them, from possible negative effects (like financial frauds), which are more likely to be present outside of regulatory boundaries. This study is one of the initial attempts in the context of the Indian Stock Market to introduce TFI as a dual (both mediating and moderating) variable between the basic constructs of TPB. Further, the study also examines the importance of trust in financial institution and financial literacy in enhancing investors' intention to participate in stock market during COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Financial Literacy as a Driver of Financial Inclusion in Kenya and Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Efforts are being exerted in many developing countries to promote financial inclusion by increasing individuals' access to financial products and services. However, literature suggests that increasing the supply of financial products and services per se may not help in expanding financial inclusion unless concerted efforts are exerted in enhancing financial literacy. This is because financially literate individuals are more likely to appreciate the value of financial services and hence take up financial products. This paper reports the link between financial literacy and inclusion using data from a demand side financial inclusion survey conducted in Kenya and Tanzania in 2016 covering a total of 6029 individuals. Results from our instrumental variable regression analysis confirmed that financial literacy is a strong driver of financial inclusion. This implies that efforts to promote financial inclusion need to be accompanied with financial literacy campaigns in both countries.

TI  - Financial literacy, education and risk aversion: a survey of French students
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose Financial literacy is generally seen as an important factor explaining a broader set of investment behaviors. In the context of a weak financial knowledge in France, this article focuses on the particular situation of Generation Z (individuals born after 1995) and more particularly management students likely to be involved in financial decisions in the near future. Design/methodology/approach The analysis is based on a survey conducted in the Fall of 2019, through a questionnaire distributed to 300 students enrolled in a French business school. Findings The results indicate that financial knowledge is poor for students who do not follow a specialized course in finance. This research also demonstrates the importance of risk behavior, showing that risk adverse students are also those with the lowest level of financial literacy. Originality/value This article contributes to the academic literature by focusing on students in France. It is the first study to examine Gen Z financial literacy and its implications. It raises awareness on the importance of financial education in the education curriculum.

TI  - Investor preferences, financial literacy and intermediary choice towards sustainability
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Based on a large and representative sample of Italian adults, our study aims to detect the determinants of retail investor preferences for socially responsible (SR) financial intermediaries, i.e., intermediaries adopting environmental, social and governance strategies and offering both traditional and SR financial products. We demonstrate that SR financial intermediaries are chosen by individuals characterized by high self-reported orientation towards SR investments and high financial literacy. Disaggregating financial literacy into its three determinants, we show that the higher the financial knowledge and the more correct financial behavior of retail investors related to savings and financial control, the higher their preference for SR financial intermediaries. On the other hand, individual financial attitude towards savings and spending displays a negative relationship with this preference. Moreover, retail investors with more specific knowledge about portfolio diversification choose more SR financial intermediaries than other people.

TI  - Effect of Regret Aversion and Information Cascade on Investment Decisions in the Real Estate Sector: The Mediating Role of Risk Perception and the Moderating Effect of Financial Literacy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The real estate sector plays a significant role in the economy of any country. However, many investors make irrational investments in the real estate market. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the effects of regret aversion and information cascade on investment decisions while considering the moderating role of financial literacy and the mediating effect of risk perception in the real estate sector of developing countries. This research utilized a quantitative research technique, collecting data by distributing structured questionnaires to real estate investors, followed by convenience sampling. This study used both descriptive and inferential statistics to make the data more meaningful. SPSS 25.0 was utilized to interpret the data. Cronbach's alpha was used to test for internal consistency, while validity was checked through correlation. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to confirm that the items on the questionnaire are perfectly loaded on their construct. Furthermore, process macro, model 5, was used to investigate the moderation mediation. This work addresses a gap in the literature by studying financial literacy as a moderator and risk perception as a mediating variable in regret aversion bias and information cascade bias's relationships with investment decisions in the real estate sector. The results confirmed that financial literacy weakens the negative effect of behavioral biases (regret aversion and information cascade) on investment decisions. In addition, risk perception mediates the relationships between these cognitive biases (regret aversion and information cascade) and decision making. The effects of other behavioral biases in real estate and stock market contexts should be examined in future research.

TI  - Understanding the Gender Gap in Financial Literacy: Evidence from Australia
T2  - ECONOMIC RECORD
AB  - Using micro-data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, and the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition technique, this paper examines the determinants of the gender gap in financial literacy. The analysis suggests that human capital variables, such as age and education, are not important in explaining the gender gap in financial literacy. Labour market variables, such as sector, occupation, industry, union membership and labour market status, are important and explain around 16 per cent of the gap. This finding is dependent on the assumption that these variables are exogenous. There is a large unexplained gap, suggesting that the main determinants are neither human capital nor labour market factors.

TI  - Financial Literacy in Plastic Surgery Training: Importance and Current Status
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
AB  - Background:Medical training is known to impose financial burden on trainees, which has been shown to contribute to burnout, even possibly compromising patient care. Financial literacy allows for management of financial situations affecting professional and personal life. The authors aimed to evaluate the financial status and knowledge among plastic surgery residents.Methods:A survey regarding finances and financial literacy of plastic surgery residents was sent to all the current accredited U.S. residency programs. The same survey was distributed internally. A descriptive analysis was performed, and multiple Fisher exact tests and a t test evaluated comparisons.Results:Eighty-six residents were included. Most trainees had a student loan (59.3%), with 22.1% having loans more than $300,000. A majority had at least one personal loan debt other than educational (51.1%). Residents with more debt were significantly less likely to pay off their balances monthly. A total of 17.4% of trainees had no plan for how to invest their retirement savings, whereas 55.8% reported not knowing how much they need to save to retire. One in five trainees did not feel prepared to manage personal finances/retirement planning after graduation, a majority had no formal personal finance education in their curriculum, and 89.5% agreed that financial literacy education would be beneficial. Our institutional data largely mirrored national data.Conclusions:Many residents are lacking in financial knowledge, despite most having significant debt. Additional financial literacy education is needed in plastic surgery training. Curricula development at an institutional or national society level are possible paths toward a coordinated response to this need.

TI  - Financial Literacy and portfolio diversification: Evidence from Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPETITIVENESS
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the level of financial knowledge and portfolio diversification in Vietnam, an emerging financial market in Asia. To achieve this objective, we conducted an online survey of 343 investors actively participating in Vietnam's financial markets in 2020. The survey's primary goal was to assess both basic and advanced knowledge levels among investors in the field of finance, as well as their foundational grasp of economics. To gauge the extent of portfolio diversification among these investors, we included questions pertaining to the number of stocks and financial assets comprising their portfolios. The results of ordinary least squares and Probit regressions reveal a significant correlation between investors' financial knowledge and the extent of their portfolio diversification in Vietnam. Notably, comprehension of concepts such as the time value of money within digital currencies, financial assets, and risk measurement emerges as a pivotal factor influencing portfolio diversification levels. However, there is no significant relationship found between knowledge of economics and portfolio diversification. Furthermore, investors' personal circumstances, including their job positions and income, can also exert an influence on the degree of portfolio diversification they undertake. These findings underscore the importance of enhancing investors' understanding of financial products, as doing so can bolster competitiveness and serve as an effective means of enhancing the efficiency of Vietnam's financial markets. In light of these results, investors and policymakers should consider implementing measures aimed at adapting to market requirements, thereby fostering sustainable development.

TI  - Financial Adviser Anxiety, Financial Literacy, and Financial Advice Seeking
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Seeking professional financial advice to assist with financial decision making is an important option for consumers faced with increased responsibility for their own financial circumstances. We explore the role of two potential barriers/enablers to accessing financial advice. First, we explore the role of a variety of financial literacy measures to explain observed financial advice consultation. Second, we introduce a newly developed measure of financial adviser anxiety. We define adviser anxiety as (an existing or prospective clients') concerns involving the prospect of meeting with a financial adviser. The notion of adviser anxiety is inspired by evidence from medical settings that suggest individuals may refrain from seeking advice when objectively, it is in their best interests to do so. This anxiety may be due to embarrassment, worry, or other forms of apprehension associated with the consultation process. A new scale is presented which has strong validity and a demonstrated ability to explain reported future levels of professional advice seeking.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between financial literacy and student attitudes toward graduate school. In the framework of human capital theory, we argue that graduate school is an investment in an individual's human capital that enhances future earnings capability. We hypothesize that during a weakened job market in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic that students who are more financially literate will demonstrate a more positive attitude toward a graduate degree as an appealing and rewarding capital investment than students with less financial literacy. Our robust results are consistent with our hypothesis. We argue that these findings have significant economic implications.

TI  - Financial literacy and financial resilience: Evidence from around the world
T2  - FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - We measure financial literacy using questions assessing basic knowledge of four fundamental concepts in financial decision making: knowledge of interest rates, interest compounding, inflation, and risk diversification. Worldwide, just one in three adults are financially literate-that is, they know at least three out of the four financial concepts. Women, poor adults, and lower educated respondents are more likely to suffer from gaps in financial knowledge. This is true not only in developing countries but also in countries with well-developed financial markets. Relatively low financial literacy levels exacerbate consumer and financial market risks as increasingly complex financial instruments enter the market. Credit products, many of which carry high interest rates and complex terms and conditions, are becoming more readily available. Yet only around half of adults in major emerging countries who use a credit card or borrow from a financial institution are financially literate. We discuss policies to protect borrowers against risks and encourage account holders to save.

TI  - Digital transformation in financial industry: antecedents of fintech adoption, financial literacy and quality of life
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to investigate the variables that could contribute to facilitating or hindering FinTech adoption in Jordan and how that will affect human well-being (quality of life [QoL]).Design/methodology/approachA conceptual framework was formulated through the integration of "the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology" (UTAUT), "task-technology fit" (TTF) model and two additional factors, namely, "financial literacy" (FL) and "quality of life" (QoL). A cross-sectional online survey was used to obtain data from 378 FinTech users employing a quantitative method. AMOS 26.0 was utilized to analyse the data based on "structural equation modelling" (SEM).FindingsThe analysis of the structural path found that UTAUT constructs including "performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), facilitating conditions (FC), social influence (SI)", and TTF were significant determinants of FinTech adoption. Only technology characteristics (TECH) was a significant predictor of TTF. Also, the analysis of empirical data revealed a significant mediating impact of FinTech adoption on the association between FL and QoL, underlining the important role of digital FL in digitalizing societies. Likewise, FL affected the QoL directly.Practical implicationsThis research will be beneficial for "FinTech service providers" (FSPs) and policymakers to offer thorough insights regarding the current relatively low acceptance rates of FinTech, contributing to strategies' formulation that could promote FinTech usage by Jordanian customers, where FinTech is still considered an innovative technology. In addition, FL needs to integrate digital literacy to utilize state-of-the-art technologies for more effective financial management. This is with being able to make decisions facilitating the management of life outcomes which could result in better QoL.Originality/valueTo the best of the author's knowledge, this research is the first research paper that integrates the UTAUT and TTF models and also adds two additional constructs, namely, FL and QoL, to investigate the FinTech in the Jordanian setting. This study could contribute to the literature on IT adoption by considering FinTech usage and incorporation into individuals' life in Jordan.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Broker-Borrower Interaction and Mortgage Default
T2  - REAL ESTATE ECONOMICS
AB  - This article examines the relationship between broker-borrower interaction in the origination process and subsequent mortgage performance. I show that face-to-face interaction between a mortgage broker and borrower before the loan funds is associated with lower levels of ex postdefault. The relation between face-to-face broker-borrower interaction and mortgage performance holds only for borrowers that have characteristics associated with low levels of financial literacy. Specifically, face-to-face interaction is negatively related to default for minorities, borrowers located in areas with low levels of education, low-income borrowers and borrowers with low FICO scores. My results suggest that face-to-face interaction between the mortgage broker and borrower may reduce problems associated with financial illiteracy.

TI  - Changing Saving and Investment Behaviour: The Impact of Financial Literacy Training and Reminders on Micro-businesses
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - In developing countries, savings is an important financial tool, particularly for micro-business with limited access to credit. However, micro-entrepreneurs often undersave, even when they have some surplus and the desire to save. Knowledge gaps and behavioural biases such as limited attention have been discussed as potential constraints on saving. To test ways to alleviate such constraints, we offered a 4-hour financial literacy training and periodic SMS reminders for 3 months to a randomly selected group of micro-entrepreneurs in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We particularly compared the joint treatment to the two treatments in isolation for the first time in the literature. We find that SMS reminders increased savings relative to no treatment, and that the combination of reminders and financial training improved the financial literacy score and increased short-term deposits in the bank. Our results confirm earlier findings that savings can be limited by attention, and that financial literacy matters for saving behaviour when saving is at the top of the mind.

TI  - Impact of financial literacy, perceived access to finance, ICT use, and digitization on credit constraints: evidence from Qatari MSME importers
T2  - FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB  - This study investigates the role of financial literacy (FL), perceived access to finance (PAF), information communication technology (ICT) usage, and digitization in alleviating the level of credit constraint that micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) face in an emerging market. We draw on the economic research theories of human capital, knowledge-based view, and lifecycle hypothesis to explain the relationship between the variables. Using survey data collected from 333 MSME importers in Qatar-a country with heavy reliance on foreign goods-we find strong evidence that FL, PAF, ICT usage, and digitization are key determinants of Qatari MSME access to credit. In particular, PAF and FL are significant and have their expected signs in almost all the Probit regressions. For ICT usage and digitization, although they are key determinants of credit constraints, the findings are more sensitive and dependent on the type of financing and the resulting type of credit constraint.

TI  - Digital financial literacy among adults in India: measurement and validation
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has considerably promoted the usage of Digital Financial Services (DFS) in India. Therefore, exploring the various determinants influencing the DFS users is crucial for the DFS providers to understand their customers better. This study aims to identify, measure, and validate the determinants of Digital Financial Literacy (DFL) from the Indian adults who use Digital Financial Services. A sample of 384 adult DFS users from India was surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire in 2021. A multidimensional scale was developed to measure the Digital Financial Literacy in this study. The results exhibit that Digital Knowledge, Financial Knowledge, Knowledge of DFS, Awareness of Digital Finance Risk, Digital Finance Risk Control, Knowledge of Customer Right, Product Suitability, Product Quality, Gendered Social Norm, Practical Application of Knowledge and Skill, Self-determination to use the Knowledge and Skill and Decision Making are the determinants of DFL among the adults in India. Further, the users of DFS without DFL will face numerous challenges such as inability to complete the transaction, financial loss and privacy breach, etc. Hence, the study concludes that DFL is prerequisite to use DFS effectively.

TI  - FinTech and money laundering: moderating effect of financial regulations and financial literacy
T2  - DIGITAL POLICY REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to investigate the impact of FinTech on money laundering within the context of Nigeria. The motivation stems from observations suggesting that FinTech platforms might be used for illicit money transfers, particularly from developed to developing economies. While existing literature predominantly highlights the positive aspects of FinTech, there's a dearth of studies addressing its potential association with money laundering. Current understanding of this relationship relies heavily on anecdotal evidence derived from reported or convicted cases. Thus, the primary goal of this study is to analyze the influence of FinTech on money laundering while also considering the moderating effects of financial regulation and financial literacy as perceived by users. The research delves into regulatory perspectives concerning money laundering and FinTech.Design/methodology/approachTo fulfill the study's objectives, a quantitative research design is used. A survey of 248 FinTech users in Nigeria is conducted using structured questionnaires. Data collected from the questionnaires is analyzed using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).FindingsThe quantitative analysis revealed a significant relationship between FinTech and money laundering and that financial regulation moderates the relationship between FinTech and money laundering in Nigeria, but such was not established with respect to financial literacy. The results of the quantitative approach that uses secondary data are consistent with the qualitative approach. FinTech the results indicate the presence of technology induced money laundering in Nigeria. Regulating technology-based anti-money laundering poses serious challenges for developing countries due to the absence of specific laws that mitigate the threats.Research limitations/implicationsThe paper focuses on Nigeria as a case study, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other countries with different FinTech ecosystems, regulatory frameworks and financial literacy levels.Practical implicationsThe finding is useful in developing guidelines and regulations by policymakers and strategies by practitioners in relation to FinTech, money laundering, financial regulation and financial literacy. On the basis of the above, the authors recommend regulation at the national and industry level to mitigate the adverse effect of technology on money laundering. Thus, multilateral partnerships can help in tackling tech-induced money laundering through strengthened cooperation.Social implicationsMoney laundering risks: The study highlights that FinTech, while beneficial, also poses significant risks for money laundering activities, especially in developing countries like Nigeria. Regulatory Importance: It emphasizes the critical role of financial regulations in mitigating the risks associated with FinTech and money laundering. Financial Literacy: The paper suggests that financial literacy does not significantly moderate the relationship between FinTech and money laundering, indicating the need for stronger regulatory measures rather than relying solely on financial literacy. Policy Formulation: The findings are crucial for policymakers to formulate strategies that balance the benefits of FinTech with the need to prevent money laundering and ensure financial system integrity.Originality/valueThis research presents a novel approach to methodology, specifically focusing on the qualitative research design, addressing population, sampling techniques and data collection methods.
   It emphasizes techniques aimed at ensuring measurement quality and achieving research objectives. Data collection used survey questionnaires, while analysis involved both statistical package for social science (SPSS) and PLS-SEM. SPSS facilitated descriptive and preliminary analyses, while PLS-SEM confirmed measurement quality and tested hypotheses. Ethical considerations were paramount throughout the research process, underscoring the commitment to maintaining originality in research endeavors.

TI  - EMPLOYEE FINANCIAL LITERACY AND RETIREMENT PLAN BEHAVIOR: A CASE STUDY
T2  - ECONOMIC INQUIRY
AB  - This article uses administrative data on all active employees of the Federal Reserve (FR) System to examine participation in and contributions to the Thrift Saving Plan, the System's defined contribution (DC) plan. We link to administrative records a unique employee survey of economic/demographic factors including a set of financial literacy questions. Not surprisingly, FR employees are substantially more financially literate than the population at large. Most importantly, financially savvy employees are also most likely to participate in their DC plan. Sophisticated workers contribute three percentage points more of their earnings to the DC plan than do the less knowledgeable, and they hold more equity in their pension accounts. We examine changes in employee plan behavior 1 year after employees completed a Learning Module about retirement planning, and we compare it to baseline patterns. We find that those employees who completed the Learning Module were more likely to start contributing and less likely to have stopped contributing to the DC plan postsurvey. In sum, employer-provided learning programs are shown to significantly impact employee retirement saving decisions and consistent with a lot of other research, higher levels of financial literacy are found to have a beneficial impact on retirement saving patterns.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY AMONG TURKISH COLLEGE STUDENTS: THE ROLE OF FORMAL EDUCATION, LEARNING APPROACHES, AND PARENTAL TEACHING
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
AB  - This study assessed financial literacy and its correlates among Turkish college students, with special emphasis on the role of formal education, learning approaches, and parental influences. Financial literacy was measured by the College Student Financial Literacy Survey, which assesses knowledge in four areas: general financial management, saving and borrowing, insurance, and investing. 853 Turkish university students were administered the survey (416 men, 437 women; M age = 20.3 yr., SD = 0.6). The mean percentage of correct responses was 45% (SD = 12.8%). Regression results showed that formal finance education in college, a deep approach to learning, and direct financial teaching by parents were significantly associated with higher financial literacy scores.

TI  - Keeping It Simple: Financial Literacy and Rules of Thumb
T2  - AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB  - Micro-entrepreneurs often lack the financial literacy required to make important financial decisions. We conducted a randomized evaluation with a bank in the Dominican Republic to compare the impact of two distinct programs: standard accounting training versus a simplified, rule-of-thumb training that taught basic financial heuristics. The rule-of-thumb training significantly improved firms' financial practices, objective reporting quality, and revenues. For micro-entrepreneurs with lower skills or poor initial financial practices, the impact of the rule-of-thumb training was significantly larger than that of the standard accounting training, suggesting that simplifying training programs might improve their effectiveness for less sophisticated individuals.

TI  - When Does the Gender Gap in Financial Literacy Begin?
T2  - ECONOMIC RECORD
AB  - Research to date has failed to generate a comprehensive understanding of the source of the gender gap in financial literacy in adulthood. Using microdata from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey and an analysis covering four age groups (15-19, 20-24, 25-29 and 30-34), this paper suggests that the gender gap starts young and well before individuals enter adulthood. The analysis also suggests that that raw (unadjusted) gender gap likely underestimates the underlying gap. It is important to establish whether the gap begins before or after children enter school, since policy aimed at addressing it would be very different.

TI  - Opportunities to Increase Financial Well-Being by Investing in Environmental, Social and Governance with Respect to Improving Financial Literacy under COVID-19: The Case of Latvia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The latest studies reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed investors in developed economies to focus more on the value attached to environmental and social responsibilities. Unfortunately, socially responsible investment and compliance with environmental, social and governance criteria are not given enough priority in Latvia at present. The purpose of the study is to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the willingness of Latvians to invest in assets that meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria and factors influencing investors' choice based on their financial literacy. Different views on sustainable investments, socially responsible investments and the relevance of environmental, social and governance criteria from private investors' perspectives were analyzed to identify factors influencing investment decisions in favour of sustainable investments. Quantitative analysis was carried out to reveal the regularities between financial literacy, the willingness to invest to meet the ESG criteria and the level of education and income of the Latvian population, as well as their savings/investment experience. Such statistical methods as descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing were applied to perform an analysis of the results. The authors' findings include the importance of sustainable investing to Latvian society, changes of attitude towards ESG investing in different private investors' groups under the COVID-19 crisis, and the effects of these changes on the financial well-being of the population and, on the basis of these findings, have come to the conclusion that the willingness to invest in the assets that follow environmental, social and governance criteria depends on the level of education, savings/investment experience and income level.

TI  - SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS, RISK PROPENSITY, AND INVESTMENT DIVERSITY MODERATING ROLE OF FINANCIAL LITERACY
T2  - INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT & APPLIED SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Human behaviour is a complex phenomenon that combines psychological traits with decision-making. Therefore, it is an intricate relationship between traditional finance and cognitive behaviour. Financial policymaking and investments are practical manifestations of asset allocation decisions taken under the influence of human personality biases dominating mind of decision-maker through analyzing empirical data. This paper is a shift from professional investors; rather it attempts to explore the behaviour of non-professional i.e. common people to find out the relationship between risk behavior and effects of socio-demographics on personal asset allocation decisions by common citizens not having much awareness of financial instruments with an aim to find out moderating effects of financial literacy. This descriptive study has been carried out on a survey questionnaire containing 70 items on 775 respondents from Pakistan, Canada, Tunisia, Romania, Jordan, Moldova and UK including 85 military personnel and personal interviews of 18 respondents. The outcome of research indicates that in decision making domain financial literacy has been found to significantly moderate relationship between socio-demographics, risk propensity and investment decision-making. It concludes that with increase in age and marital status the investment diversity improves, moreover married/widowed women are more risk-averse than males. However, married people as a whole tend to diversify their investments; however, financial literacy and education contribute towards investment diversity and reduce the risk-taking ability. Hence, this survey can be used as an effective tool for designing financial instruments for general community. (C) 2020 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.

TI  - Young adults' financial literacy and overconfidence bias in debt markets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
AB  - It is documented that overconfidence has negative influence on numerous financial behaviours. Little is known, however, about the link between overconfidence and behaviour of consumers in debt markets. This article investigates the link between overconfidence in debt literacy and debt behaviour. To do that, we applied logit and linear regression models using data from a sample of 600 adult Poles aged between 18 and 35. The results indicate that the overconfident respondents were more likely to borrow. We obtained mixed results regarding the link between overconfidence and debt behaviour. Simple binary measure of overconfidence turned out insignificant in predicting the behaviour, however the quantitative measures of overconfidence were found significantly and positively related to unhealthy debt behaviour. Policy makers may need to run educational programmes that address the behavioural aspects of overconfidence, in order to empower society and improve debt behaviour and overall economic performance.

T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - This study examines the effects of religiosity and Islamic financial literacy on Muslims' financial behavior and well-being. Additionally, it investigates the impact of sociodemographic variables on the centrality of religiosity, financial literacy, financial management behavior, and the well-being of Muslim consumers. This research integrates perspectives from Rational Choice Theory, the Rational Choice Theory of Religion, and Behavioral Finance to illuminate the mechanisms behind these relationships. Data were collected through a non-probability sampling method from 1141 Muslim individuals aged between 18 and 65 living in Indonesia. The results indicate that the centrality of religion in the lives of Muslim consumers and Islamic financial literacy significantly affects their financial management behavior and financial well-being. However, the empirical evidence suggests a more substantial effect of Islamic financial literacy than religiosity on both dependent variables.

TI  - HOW DO SAVINGS AND PERSONAL BUDGETING MATTER ON FINANCIAL LITERACY AND WELL-BEING
T2  - BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMICS ENGINEERING
AB  - Purpose - the well-being of individuals plays a vital role in fostering sustainable economic development. The differentiation between subjective and objective well-being in selected EU and selected non-EU countries, with a particular focus on financial literacy, as individuals' assessments of their own well-being can significantly differ from objective economic indicators, emphasizing the subjective nature of well-being. The research objective is to investigate how savings and personal budgeting indicators affect both objective and sub-jective well-being and to examine the role of these indicators in promoting financial literacy. Research methodology - the research investigates the impact of savings and personal budget-ing indicators on financial literacy (FLI), financial well-being (FWB), and gross domestic prod-uct at purchasing power parity per capita (GDP PPP per capita). We applied Pearson's pairwise correlation between nine indicators of personal budgeting and savings and the method of principal components to identify the reasonable factors according to their statistical significance based on data from 22 countries included in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development/International Network on Financial Education (OECD/INFE) survey data, Global Findex Database. The application of the Varimax procedure made it possible to identify factor groups of indicators. Findings - we identify two factors for the whole sample and a sample of selected EU-countries; for non-EU-countries were identified three factors. Our research reveals that subjective FWB across all countries and non-EU countries is under the significant influence of factor group 1 mainly represented by savings indicators, with no significance for EU countries. FLI also significantly depends on factor group 1 for the entire sample of countries and across EU and non-EU countries. GDP PPP per capita is under the significant influence of all factors both in the sample of countries and across EU and non-EU countries. Research limitations - FLI databases started to be gathered relatively recently and are not regularly updated. This can cause a situation when data for different countries are provided with time gaps. Moreover, due to the high cost involved, not all countries conduct such re-search, which hinders the creation of large datasets for more accurate country comparisons. Practical implications - the results of this study may have interest for policymakers since they focus on improvement of the financial literacy and FWB of individuals, that results in a higher level of financial stability. Originality/Value - this research is to address existing gaps in understanding of the interplay between subjective and objective FWB. Also, it proposes a novel approach that views savings as a factor that enhances financial literacy, in contrast to the conventional approach that con -siders savings as a consequence of improved FWB.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY
AB  - Purpose The main purpose of this study is to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected from the poor who resides in rural Uganda. Structural equation modelling (SEM) through analysis of moment structures (AMOS) was used to analyze the data. Bootstrap approach with 5,000 samples was run to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Findings The results showed that social network significantly and positively mediate the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. In addition, financial literacy also has a direct significant and positive effect on financial inclusion. Overall, the findings suggest that the presence of social network fully mediate the effect of financial literacy on financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Research limitations/implications This study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Future studies could adopt longitudinal research design to establish the dynamic characteristics of the samples under study over time. Besides, this study collected data from only poor households who were clients of microfinance banks located in rural Uganda. It ignored the other section of the population who were not the poor. Therefore, future studies could use the other section of the population who are clients of commercial banks. Practical implications The advocates of financial literacy and managers of microfinance banks in developing countries should ensure using existing local structures such as community and village associations to conduct financial literacy training. The village associations help in mobilizing members who are close-knit based on the existing societal ties that can be used as a channel for disseminating vital financial literacy information. Indeed, financial literacy workshops, seminars, and business clinics can be easily conducted to individuals who are members of the village associations. Originality/value This paper integrates social network theory in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Social network acts as a conduit through which financial knowledge and skills flow to increase the scope of financial inclusion of the poor in developing countries.

TI  - The Purposes and Motivations of Savings Accumulation based on Generational Affiliation, Financial Education and Financial Literacy
T2  - ACTA POLYTECHNICA HUNGARICA
AB  - In today's fast-paced world, we have had to learn that uncertainty is constant, and that we have to face it in unexpected situations. It is not only our income that is affected by uncertainty in the future, but also our jobs and our livelihoods, which, in many cases, depend on other factors. Global conflict situations only add to this sense of insecurity. In uncertain situations, the fundamental goal of individuals and organisations is to seek security through the means at their disposal. This is no different for our finances. Savings are a key element in the lives of individuals, households and businesses in managing such uncertainties. Savings have always been crucial at the level of the national economy as well, as they have been the source of investment according to classical economics. Nations with a high savings rate have always been able to invest more and have thus enjoyed greater economic growth. Savings, by their role as a store of wealth, help to deal with sudden and unexpected situations. Today, however, savings no longer have only a security function, but must be seen as a collateral for future consumption, a source of future consumption needs, a guarantee of maintaining the standard of living to which we have become accustomed. The current paper sets out to observe and examine the rationale behind savings accumulation from the point of view of households in the light of the pandemic. It is also an objective to identify the impact of the pandemic on the security function of savings formation, providing a picture of the motivations of different generations to save and make savings for the future, based on the results of a questionnaire survey conducted in Hungary.

TI  - What does 'Big Three' tell us about retirement planning skills?
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - In this paper, we present the results of financial knowledge assessment from a nationwide survey carried out in Poland in 2019. To measure this phenomenon, we use the well-grounded scale, the 'Big Three' financial literacy questions, proposed by Mitchell and Lusardi. The results are similar to those of studies in other countries. However, we find that financial literacy scores poorly predict reasonable answers to the retirement planning question. We present hypotheses to explain this finding and recommend potential solutions.

TI  - Orthopaedic Surgery Resident Financial Literacy: An Assessment of Knowledge in Debt, Investment, and Retirement Savings
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
CP  - Meeting of the American-Orthopaedic-Association
AB  - Most orthopedic residents carry significant debt and may enter their practice with little knowledge of business management, minimal retirement savings, and overall poor financial literacy. This study aimed to gauge financial literacy, debt, and retirement planning in United States orthopedic surgery residents. Willingness to participate in formalized financial education was also assessed. Eighty-five allopathic orthopedic surgery residents in the United States completed a 14-question anonymous online survey in 2016. The survey assessed demographic data, self-assessed financial knowledge, amount of credit card debt and loans, preparation for retirement, and willingness to participate in formal didactic education on these topics. Most respondents derive their financial knowledge from personal research (51%), whereas only 4 per cent have a formal curriculum. Despite most respondents reporting more than $200,000 in outstanding loans, only 31 per cent create and stick to a budget. Few programs offer retirement advice, and 48 per cent of respondents save $0 toward retirement. Eighty-five per cent of residents expressed interest in learning about personal investment, savings, and retirement planning. Orthopedic surgery residents carry significant debt and do not achieve their high-income potential until disproportionately later in life. Only 4 per cent of residents have formal training in investing, personal finance, or retirement despite a majority who desire such a curriculum. In fact, almost 75 per cent of those surveyed felt less prepared for retirement than their peers outside of medical training. This study suggests a role for formal financial education in the orthopedic curriculum to prepare residents for retirement, improve financial literacy, and enhance debt management.

TI  - Resilience and wellbeing in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - Using the 2021 wave of the TIAA Institute-GFLEC Personal Finance Index (P-Fin Index), this paper provides an in-depth examination of the financial literacy of U.S. adults in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge is troublingly low, with U.S. adults averaging a score of 50 percent on the twenty-eight questions that compose the P-Fin Index. Even more disturbingly, only 28 percent of U.S. adults correctly answered a question testing their abil-ity to comprehend and compare probabilities. Financial literacy matters. Lower financial literacy is associated with increased time spent worrying about personal finances. After controlling for income, education, and key demographic information, the more financially literate are found to be more likely to be financially resilient, to plan for retirement, and to feel unconstrained by debt. These findings highlight the importance of financial knowl-edge, in particular in a time of crisis, and raise concerns about the public's ability to com-prehend complex messages about risk during the pandemic.

TI  - How Text Presentation and Financial Literacy Affect Pension Communication Success
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS COMMUNICATION
AB  - This study examined the effects of (a) text presentation and (b) prior knowledge and language skill on finding information in financial documents. First, the participants filled out tests that measured their levels of vocabulary, reading skill, domain knowledge, and topic knowledge. Subsequently, they read an on-screen text on pension information in either a linear structure ("nonlayered") or a hypertext structure ("layered"). Readers' performance was measured by verbal scenario questions. No difference was found for text presentation. Language skill and domain knowledge were both important predictors for finding, whereas topic knowledge was not associated with readers' performance at all. When differentiating between text presentation conditions, we found that domain knowledge only plays a role in the nonlayered condition, not in the layered condition. These results indicate that the set of skills needed to successfully read a document varies with both type of task and type of reading, confirming prior research.

TI  - Financial literacy is not enough: The role of nudging toward adequate long-term saving behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - This paper analyzes whether nudging has a relevant effect on financially literate individuals, even if these individuals are professionals with extensive experience of finance and pensions. The paper presents the results of a field experiment with employees of a leading life and pensions company in Spain. The results of the experiment show that financial literacy and awareness of the importance of saving are not enough for individuals to act. Even with pension plan experts, the combination of two types of instruments is necessary: rational instruments, such as financial literacy and awareness of the economic implications of retirement, and nudging, which moves individuals to action in a meaningful way. In this case, an effective approach is to use the default option to increase long-term saving patterns. The Ahorra + program, which was implemented in 2016 with 282 employees and in 2017 with 405 employees, significantly increases voluntary savings and helps people prepare for retirement.

TI  - The impact of FinTech innovation on digital financial literacy in Europe: Insights from the banking industry
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Within the evolving financial industry, characterised by the proliferation of FinTech and exacerbated by the Covid-19 , this paper investigates the unexplored relationship between financial, social, infrastructural factors and the level of digital financial divide (DFD) in Europe. Applying a difference-in-difference model, the study reveals that innovation in financial services correlates with a reduced DFD, further reinforced by improved digital infrastructure and social progress. However, the post-Covid environment has widened the gap in EU financially illiterate regions. Our results hold relevance for policymakers, governments, and supervisory banking authorities, indicating the most effective areas for intervention in lowering the country's DFD, but they could also support banks in the design of tailor-made digitalization strategies.

TI  - Financial Literacy Externalities
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - We use unique administrative data and a quasi-field experiment of exogenous allocation in Sweden to estimate medium- and longer-run effects of peoples' exposure to financially literate neighbors on their financial behavior. We contribute evidence of (1) a causal impact of exposure and of a social multiplier of financial knowledge and (2) unfavorable distributional aspects of externalities. Exposure promotes saving in private retirement accounts and stockholding, especially when neighbors have economics or business education, but only for educated households and for substantial interaction possibilities. Findings point to a transfer of knowledge rather than mere imitation or effects through labor, education, or mobility channels.

TI  - Earnings growth, marketability and the role of Islamic financial literacy and inclusion in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to describe earnings growth and marketability generated by Islamic banks in Indonesia and to find the effects of a moderated mediation model on the nexus between Islamic financial inclusion and literacy, marketability and earnings growth. Design/methodology/approachThe sample of this research was Islamic commercial banks in Indonesia listed on the Financial Services Authority and Bank Indonesia using time-series data of financial statements from 2014 to 2021. This research was designed using the model of moderated mediation. FindingsEarnings growth experienced by Islamic banks in Indonesia has a positive average value followed by a positive marketability. Based on the significance test, the level of earnings growth is positively affected by marketability. The result indicates that the higher the marketability, the higher the earnings growth of Islamic banks. In a moderated mediation model, the result has found a positive effect on the nexus between inclusion supported by the role of literacy, marketability and earnings growth. It indicates that Islamic financial inclusion moderated purely by the role of literacy enhances Islamic banking marketability so that earnings growth continuously increases. Practical implicationsThe increase of literacy is an empirically proven way to strengthen market power, so the finding obtained in this research can be feedback from the scheme made by the Indonesian government in supporting the Islamic business and for the corporate area being eager to grow greater and faster in competing and equalizing its power in the banking industry. In addition, this research implies that other countries continuously promote and increase the role of Islamic financial literacy and inclusion to enhance market power and increase the growth in Islamic banking. Originality/valueThis research extends the limited scholarly work on the role of Islamic financial literacy and inclusion using a different design from prior studies. The framework of market power theory has been elaborated to find the effect of Islamic financial inclusion supported by the role of literacy on earnings growth through marketability. This research is a trailblazer in testing the nexus model between variables allowing the path analysis using the moderated mediation model.

TI  - FINANCIAL EXCLUSION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF FINANCIAL LITERACY IN THE DIGITAL WORLD OF THE 21ST CENTURY THROUGH THE EXAMPLE OF HUNGARY
T2  - TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS
AB  - The turbulent changes of the 21st century have affected all aspects of our lives. The digital revolution, driven by the fourth industrial revolution, has created new platforms for economic players to work, interact socially and administer. However, preparedness for digitalisation and thriving in the digital space is not a basic skill for all sectors, and there are significant differences between generations. All of this feeds into another key problem of the 21st century, which is called financial exclusion. Access to the digital space varies significantly across countries, regions within countries and generations. The objective of this paper is to examine the phenomenon of financial exclusion and the problems that arise from it, paving the way towards possible solutions.

TI  - Unlocking sustainable competitive performance in agro-based small and medium enterprises in South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation countries
T2  - AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS-ZEMEDELSKA EKONOMIKA
AB  - Agro-based small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are currently receiving top priority among policymakers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations due to their great contribution to employment and GDP growth. This study examines the impact of financial literacy on the sustainable competitive performance of agro-based SMEs, with a focus on the mediating role of access to digital finance and the moderating role of business experience. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), we analysed data from 345 SME owner-managers. The results indicate that financial literacy positively affects sustainable competitive performance, with access to digital finance serving as a significant mediator. However, business experience does not moderate the relationship between financial literacy and access to digital finance. These findings suggest that improving financial literacy and enhancing digital finance access are critical for the sustainable development of agro-based SMEs in the SAARC region.

TI  - Does intention influence the financial literacy of depositors of Islamic banking? A case of Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose Since the establishment of Islamic banks in Malaysia since the 1980s, the banking system has undergone rampant development within the financial industry. It has resulted in a positive competitive challenge for the conventional banks and able to attract not just the Muslim customers, but also those non-Muslim customers. At the same time, understanding the customers' knowledge of Islamic banking products is an interesting issue to explore. This issue is raised because the Islamic bank products are often packaged using Arabic terms, even though it is marketed in non-Arabic countries like Malaysia. Therefore, this study aims to examine the factors that influence the intention of the Islamic banking customers as the result of relying on some information produced by Malaysian Islamic banks. Design/methodology/approach This study is conducted using the existing underpinning theory of planned behaviour (TPB). A total of 300 questionnaires were analysed using the structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings The results indicated that perceived behavioural control, attitude and subjective norms of the Islamic banking depositors are positively influenced by the intention of the depositors to learn about Islamic banking. Research limitations/implications One of the main issues faced in this study is the result cannot be generalised. It is not possible to know based on the collected data if the sample is representative, other than the fact that all of the respondents are Islamic bank depositors. Nevertheless, it can still be a catalyst for further research as a link to existing findings in the area. There might be a bias on the understanding of the respondents about Islamic banking. This is due to the fact that Malaysia is a multi-racial population. Malay people might have a better understanding and basic knowledge about Islamic banking than the Chinese, Indians and other races. This cultural bias could be overcome in future studies by identifying respondents who have experiences in dealing with Islamic banking. Originality/value This study provides interesting insights of the Malaysian banking industry in terms of the multi-racial customers' intention to learn about Islamic banking, which is scarcely discussed in the extant literature.

TI  - Do Shadow Banking Depositors Discipline the Market?
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - The shadow banking sector comprises non-bank financial institutions that do not have a deposit guarantee and are barely supervised by the regulator. Efforts to monitor shadow banking must be done well, in both developed and developing countries. Regulators in several countries however have not been fully effective in supervising shadow banking financial institutions, particularly in developing countries such as Indonesia. Therefore, the public's role-in this case, depositors-is essential to supervise shadow banking through the practice of market discipline. However, some factors may cause the market discipline practice to fail, such as low financial literacy. This research aims to examine the influence of financial literacy on the performance of market discipline. This study's research method is a survey of 255 lecturers who have savings accounts in the shadow banking sector in Indonesia. The multivariate analysis method used in this study is partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). This study provides evidence that financial literacy and its variables significantly affect market discipline's effectiveness in shadow banking. By showing that market discipline plays a role in building a sustainable financial ecosystem, this research contributes to depositors, investors, the financial industry, and regulators. Promoting market discipline is an important duty of regulators and other financial institutions. Likewise, promoting financial literacy among depositors and investors, especially in developing countries with low literacy levels, is a challenge to overcome when seeking to create a sustainable financial system.

TI  - Unravelling the Impact of Financial Literacy on the Intention of Indian Retail Investors to Adopt Socially Responsible Investments: The Interplay of Social Self-Efficacy as a Mediating Mechanism
T2  - GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - In the context of the escalating socio-economic disparities and environmental concerns, this study delves into the intricate interplay among financial literacy (FL), social self-efficacy (SSE) and intentions for socially responsible investment (SRI). Grounded firmly in the theory of planned behaviour, a survey of 235 Indian participants was conducted employing a meticulously structured questionnaire and leveraging Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling software for robust data analysis. The research addresses pivotal questions, examining the impact of FL on fostering positive SRI attitudes, appraising the influence of subjective norms (SNs) on the intentions of Indian investors regarding SRI, and exploring the mediating role of SSE between FL and SRI intentions. The findings underscore the substantive role of FL in shaping positive attitudes towards SRI, exerting a direct influence on SRI propensities. Concurrently, SNs exert a comparable impact on SRI intentions. Notably, the study unravels a dual mediation paradigm, elucidating the sequential mediation of SRI attitude and SSE. The study yields pragmatic implications for fund managers and policymakers. It accentuates the strategic imperative of effective communication of investment benefits, necessitating tailored approaches attuned to cognitive and psychosocial orientations. In essence, the study augments our understanding of the nuanced dynamics guiding sustainable investment decisions, thereby advancing the comprehension of investor behaviour in the domain of responsible investing.

TI  - Debt literacy and debt advice-seeking behaviour among Facebook users: the role of social networks
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
AB  - Professional advice can be perceived as a means to tackle shortcomings in the objectively measured financial literacy of consumers. However, most studies suggest that less financially literate individuals are less likely to seek experts' financial advice. At the same time, it has been shown that financial confidence - or subjectively perceived financial literacy - is positively correlated with the propensity to request such professional advice. This study examines these puzzling effects in a sample of 1,055 Facebook users in Poland, and within an analytical framework that allows control of the potential endogeneity of financial literacy to professional advice. A series of regressions applied to the results of our survey showed that objective debt literacy - a little-studied aspect of financial literacy - was insignificant in explaining advice-seeking behaviour, although the decisions to ask for advice were positively dependent on subjective debt literacy. Such outcomes prove that subjective financial literacy should be treated as a separate construct which can predict financial behaviour above and beyond predictions based on objective financial literacy. Our findings also suggest a positive role for social networks in inducing desired financial actions. We found that respondents having access to greater resources embedded in their social networks are more inclined to seek professional debt advice.

A sample of 260 students participated in the study, selected using purposive sampling, and data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. The study employed a quantitative research approach with a cross-sectional research design. The empirical regression results revealed positive and statistically significant impacts of parental and peer influences, financial education, and self-control on financial literacy. Mediation analyses further indicated a significant mediating effect of financial literacy in the relationship between peer influence, self-control, parental influence, financial education, and financial saving behaviour. Drawing from the aforementioned study, the research contributes insights endorsing financial education initiatives and collaborative endeavours among stakeholders to cultivate a holistic environment conducive to financial literacy. The study contributes theoretically by incorporating financial education and self-control into established frameworks and practically by advocating curriculum reforms within Saudi Arabian universities. Limitations encompass the study's singular country focus and the absence of moderating variables, prompting a call for future research to delve into cultural variations, introduce moderators, and adopt mixed-method approaches for a more comprehensive understanding.

TI  - An Empirical Study of User Adoption of Cryptocurrency Using Blockchain Technology: Analysing Role of Success Factors like Technology Awareness and Financial Literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB  - The study aims to investigate how an individual's technology awareness, subjective financial literacy and personal innovativeness characteristics impact the intention to use blockchain-based digital currencies such as cryptocurrency. The UTAUT 2 (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2) model is extended with crucial constructs to develop the conceptual model. A total of 312 responses are analysed using Covariance-Based Structural Equation Modelling (CB-SEM). The moderation effects are assessed using multi-group analysis. The findings show a significant moderating effect of technology awareness and subjective financial literacy on the relationship between performance expectancy (PE) and behavioural intention to use cryptocurrency (BI). It further identified that performance expectancy (PE) mediates personal innovativeness (PI) and usage intentions (BI). The study adds to the growing literature of digital currency adoption by focusing on individual innovativeness, technology awareness and financial literacy. It also proposes a research model that can be generalised for new-age consumer-based financial technology adoption.

TI  - Fintech and responsibility: Buy-now-pay-later arrangements
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) arrangements have rapidly emerged as a short-term debt option, and like other innovative and disruptive Fintech, challenge existing regulation. BNPL arrangements avoided prescribed 'responsible lending' legislative obligations, which applied to similar short-term credit products. Instead, BNPL relies on 'responsible spending' in providing a potentially cheaper option than alternatives such as credit cards. We describe the interplay of regulation and responsibility with BNPL. A survey investigates whether a key demographic (young adults) have an appetite or skill for responsible use. We analyse the preference for BNPL relative to credit cards and the role of financial literacy and traits including propensity to plan and save. The findings suggest that financial literacy reduces perceived BNPL benefits and that lower financial literacy is associated with more benefits and less risks.

TI  - Teaching financial literacy through the use of market research and advertising instruction A non traditional approach
T2  - REFERENCE SERVICES REVIEW
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to describe how librarians used elements of market research, advertising and media literacy in a personal finance class.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Librarians each semester guest lecture one session in a personal finance class "Foundations of Money Education." Through this class, librarians present engaging material about market research and advertising in an effort to encourage students to think about how these external forces influence their spending behavior.
   Findings
   Students appreciate learning about advertising through the engaging use of commercials. While responses were mixed as to the applicability of the topic, the majority of students agreed that the topic was a worthwhile addition to the personal finance curriculum.
   Originality/value
   Topics such as budgets, savings, and mortgages are typically taught in personal finance classes. Teaching information about market research and advertising is a topic that is usually not covered in a personal finance class.

TI  - The role of managerial competencies in managing resources for sustainable development strategy in SMEs
T2  - SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL
AB  - PurposeGrounded in upper echelon (UE) theory, this study aims to examine the role of managerial competencies (business experience, financial literacy and digital literacy) in sustainable development strategy, with resource management as a mediator.Design/methodology/approachThe empirical data collection is conducted through a survey completed by 297 top management teams of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in Pakistan. Structural equation modelling in Smart PLS is used to substantiate the hypotheses.FindingsThe findings reveal that financially and digitally literate managers significantly contribute to the sustainable development strategies of SMEs. However, experienced managers do not focus significantly on sustainable development strategies. Resource management partially mediates the nexus between financial literacy and sustainable development strategy, as well as between digital literacy and sustainable development strategy. In contrast, resource management does not mediate the nexus between business experience and sustainable development strategy.Research limitations/implicationsThis study recommends that SMEs should prioritize managers with digital and financial literacy over those with experience. SMEs led by a management team with digital and financial literacy are more effective in resource management for sustainable development practices, whereas experienced managers may not significantly prioritize managing resources for sustainability.Originality/valueWhile research based on the UE theory significantly contributes to the body of knowledge on sustainable development, the role of managerial competencies, particularly business experience, financial literacy and digital literacy, in sustainable development strategy via resource management is neglected. This research fills this gap in the context of UE theory and thereby enriches the literature.

TI  - Pension Pessimism in the Young Generation: Basics or Instincts to Blame?
T2  - BUSINESS SYSTEMS RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB  - Background: The area of pension expectations in Hungary is barely researched. However, the importance of adequate financial literacy and self-provision is becoming obvious at the economic, the decision-making, and the individual level. Objectives: Our research is conducted to investigate state pension expectations and certain aspects of financial literacy of the young generation, and to find a behavioral explanation for their pessimistic attitude. Methods/Approach: Using a 14-question questionnaire, we collected answers from Hungarian financially educated, young people. Two hypotheses were investigated by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Besides, a comparative analysis was conducted to connect the survey results with the ten instincts published by Hans Rosling in his book `Factfulness'. Results: The outcomes are in harmony with prior expectations, i.e. i) students in finance major are aware of the connection between a longer working period and a higher retirement income; and ii) despite the unisex pension scheme there are gender differences in the expected pension age. In the comparative analysis with `Factfulness', we identified five instincts that lie behind the general pessimism of respondents. Conclusions: State pension expectations of the Hungarian young generation are overly pessimistic, the same attitude being found in international literature, as well. Pessimistic expectations can be explained using some of the ten instincts by Rosling.

TI  - Role of Financial Literacy and Saving Habits on Fintech Adoption Post Covid-19
T2  - ETIKONOMI
AB  - Research Originality: This research paper enriches existing literature on drivers of fintech adoption, including the impact of perceived trust, individual innovativeness, savings habits, and government support on Indonesian users' post-COVID-19 pandemic fintech adoption intentions. Research Objectives: This study examines the impact of post-covid changes in people's behavior, savings habits and accelerated financial literacy on strengthening Technology Adoption Model (TAM) among Indonesian fintech users. Research Methods: The researchers surveyed 536 people living in Indonesia. The data was analysed using structural equation modelling with moderator variables. Empirical Results: The research found that ease of use, usefulness, trust, and personal innovativeness are key drivers of adoption intentions. It also found that savings habits significantly increase the influence of government support on fintech adoption. Implications: This research has two important implications. First, digital finance companies should improve fintech app service quality and security further. Second, the government should also encourage the expansion of a fintech-based startup ecosystem by providing regulatory support to accelerate the progress of Indonesia's digital finance industry.

TI  - Driving Millennials To Be Investors: The Case Of Investment Decision Performance In Indonesian Capital Market
T2  - QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB  - Investment in the capital market offers the expectation of a relatively high rate of return. However, it is also considered risky, raising various obstacles in achieving the investment performance that investors expect. The present study investigated the effect of risk tolerance, financial literacy, and risky investment decisions regarding the investment performance made by millennial investors in Indonesia. Therefore, the objectives of this study were accomplished by examining the millennial who invested in the Indonesian capital market in several steps. Data collection was performed utilizing the survey method by administering electronic questionnaire media. The purposive sampling method was employed, resulting in a sample of 300 participants. Further, the data analysis was achieved by applying the partial least square method. Accordingly, the analysis results indicated that financial literacy, risk tolerance, and risky investment decisions were predictors of the investment performance of millennial investors in Indonesia. The mediation test indicated that risky investment decisions partially mediated the effect of financial literacy and risk tolerance toward investment performance. The study contributes to the literature by developing an integrated model between investment performance, risky investment decisions, risk tolerance, and financial literacy. Moreover, the practical implications of the results of this study offer beneficial impacts to investment advisors,policymakers,investors, and potential investors to help them enhance investment performance.

TI  - Doing well while doing good? Gender effects in pro-social peer-to-peer lending
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The 2008 and 2020 crises reinvigorated discussions on the need to deepen financial inclusion through fintech. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending facilitates pro-social direct lending to less "bankable" strangers while providing returns to at-times less experienced lenders. Information asymmetries and credit risk are substantial, and previous research finds suboptimal heuristics in for-profit lenders (Gonzalez, 2022). This study examines further the role of gender to facilitate "doing well while doing good". Design/methodology/approach This study examines 663 pro-social lending decisions by finance students on a mock P2P site. Testimonials were used to condition participants towards pro-social decision-making. Each participant was asked to make three lending decisions. The three loan applications were identical except for a female or male headshot (vs a control icon), and a randomly assigned difference in the trustworthiness or popularity of the male vs female loan applications among other lenders. Loan popularity is reported as a lower number of days needed to fund half the identical loan amount requested in the three loan applications (3 vs 11 days for headshot applications, and 7 days for control one). Findings Self-recognition in similar-age borrowers is more pronounced for lenders who have experienced financial trauma. Second, male lenders report higher confidence in their financial literacy and cash collateral. Third, cash collateral increases lending only to female borrowers. Fourth, higher perception of one's financial literacy increases confidence only when lending to females. Originality/value This is the first study to examine the role of gender, financial literacy, identification with borrowers, and collateral perception in pro-social P2P lending.

TI  - Modeling Changes to Survey Response Items Over Time in a Britain Financial Literacy Education Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This study develops a general method for modeling changes in response to items relating to students perceptions of personal finance and financial products. The new method is illustrated to analyze data from a sample of 1,250 students aged 16-18 who participated in a financial capability education study in the UK. We demonstrate how a quantitative indicator of the changes in students' responses can be applied in various educational research projects, particularly as a measure of program effectiveness. Predictions are based on prior survey responses, which are taken as relevant historical information for a cohort of students. We find significant changes in the responses of students toward reported career choice following the Financial Literacy Education course at national colleges in the UK.

TI  - INVESTIGATING THE FACTORS OF CONSUMERS' PURCHASE INTENTION TOWARDS LIFE INSURANCE IN BANGLADESH: AN APPLICATION OF THE THEORY OF REASONED ACTION
T2  - ASIAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - This study aims to examine the factors that influence consumer purchase intention towards life insurance. The study included religiosity, risk aversion motives, saving motives, and financial literacy with classical Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), therefore extending the model. A convenience sampling method was employed to collect data from 315 respondents working in different public and private institutions in Bangladesh. Collected data were analysed using the structural equation model (SEM). The results revealed that attitude, subjective norms, risk aversion motives, saving motives, and financial literacy have a significant positive impact on consumer purchase intention towards life insurance. Moreover, religiosity was found to have a negative impact on purchase intention. In addition, saving motives was found as a mediator in the relationship between risk aversion motives and purchase intention, as well as between financial literacy and purchase intention. Since attitude and subjective norms were found to have the most effect on purchase intention, the study implicated that marketers should emphasise company image, reputation, and the credibility of the agents, together with the significant others to whom we often turn to before making any financial decision. Finally, the study offered directions for further research after divulging several limitations.

TI  - The effect of childhood socioeconomic status on youth investment risk tolerance: Based on the life history theory perspective
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
AB  - This study based on the life history theory discusses how childhood socioeconomic status (SES)1 affects youth investment risk tolerance and proposes a moderated mediation model to examine the mediating role of life history strategies and the moderating effect of financial literacy. Based on a survey of Chinese youth, we found that childhood SES has a significant positive effect on youth investment risk tolerance and life history strategies mediate the relationship between childhood SES and investment risk tolerance. Furthermore, financial literacy not only moderates the positive relationship between childhood SES and investment risk tolerance but also moderates the indirect effect of childhood SES on investment risk tolerance through life history strategies. Specifically, the positive effect of childhood SES on investment risk tolerance through life history strategies is weakened in youth with greater financial literacy.

TI  - DOES PERFORMANCE IMPROVE SUSTAINABILITY? EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON INDONESIAN MSMEs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are business sectors known to play an essential role in the economic growth of a country, especially in Indonesia. In this context, the creative industry is one of the fastest-growing business sectors and the promotion of sustainable economic development is evident in the government's active support for improving the growth of MSMEs. Therefore, this study analyzes the impact of financial literacy and market orientation on the MSMEs performance and sustainability. The sample includes 95 respondents occupying the roles of owners or managers in the creative industry of Yogyakarta Province. The results show that financial literacy and market orientation positively impact performance and sustainability. The performance of MSMEs influences business sustainability but financial literacy has no significant impact. Therefore, the implications show the indispensable need for governmental assistance in improving the knowledge base of MSMEs owners concerning financial literacy and market orientation.

TI  - Why do Households Leave Money on the Table? The Case of Subsidized Pension Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Many individuals only save money in their savings account for their old-age provision rather than investing in more profitable asset classes. That is despite the existence of subsidized pension products, for which smallest contributions can be made monthly, which guarantee the capital preservation, and which offer higher expected returns than saving money in bank deposits. We investigate the determinants that affect individuals' decision to leave money on the table by not investing in subsidized pension products. Our results show that financial literacy and financial advice are positively related to holding such pension products. In that, our results emphasize the role of financial literacy and financial advisors for sound financial decision-making in increasingly complex financial markets.

TI  - Are Indian professional women financially literate and prepared for retirement?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - This study examines the financial literacy level of Indian professional women and its relation to their retirement planning behavior. We use factor analysis and the Rasch model to evaluate the validity and reliability of a financial literacy scale. Additionally, we use multiple regression to examine the association between demographic characteristics and financial literacy with retirement planning. Our results reveal that the respondents display low levels of financial literacy as reflected by a lack of awareness about both basic and advanced financial concepts. Further, a woman's age, income, profession (financial), and understanding of advanced financial concepts are key factors associated with retirement planning behavior. The findings have implications for financial planning professionals, advisors, regulators, and policymakers in guiding women to make better retirement decisions.

TI  - To trust is good, but to control is better: How investors discipline financial advisors' activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Using a survey of clients from one of the largest Italian banks, we find that investors with low level of trust in professional advisors seek financial counselling, but make their decisions autonomously. We investigate whether these investors exert some form of control over the recommendations they receive, and, if so, which one. Investors can push advisors to provide better recommendations either by asking for a second expert's opinion, such as in the case of credence services, or by monitoring closely the advisor's activity themselves. We find that three quarters of investors do not exert any control on advisors. Different types of financial competence-self-assessed or test-based-serve different purposes. The investors featuring higher self-assessed financial competence are more likely to control the advisor's activity. The mechanism through which investors exert control over the advisors' activity depends instead on the investors' degree of test-based financial literacy. Investors with high financial literacy directly monitor the advisors' activity. Investors with low financial literacy are more likely to seek a second professional opinion in support of the recommendations previously received. Our findings suggest that improving investors financial knowledge may foster direct control of the advisor's activity. Moreover, facilitating the comparison between financial products by standardized and centralized information may be very effective to protect poorly literate investors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Do Behavioral Biases Affect Investors' Investment Decision Making? Evidence from the Pakistani Equity Market
T2  - RISKS
AB  - Using a unique sample constructed by 600 investors' responses to a structured questionnaire, we investigate the impact of behavioral biases on the investors' investment decision making in the Pakistani equity market, as well as the roles that market anomalies and financial literacy play in the decision making process. We first document the empirical evidence to support that the behavioral biases and market anomalies are closely associated and that these two factors significantly influence the investors' investment decision making. The additional analyses confirm the mediating roles of certain market anomalies in the association between the investors' behavioral biases and their investment decision making. Furthermore, empirical evidence reveals that financial literacy moderates the association between behavioral biases and market anomalies, and eventually influences the investors' investment decision making. Overall, although the results are inconclusive for the relationships between certain variables, our results highlight the importance of financial literacy in terms of optimal investment decision making of individuals and the stability of the overall stock market.

TI  - Students and Money Management Behavior of a Malaysian Public University
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This study aims to investigate whether financial literacy, parental socialization, peer influence and self-control have a significant impact on money management among students of a Malaysian public university. In most settings, the studies on the determinants of personal saving behavior among university students focus on personality factors, attitudes toward money and possessions, and financial knowledge as predictors of money management behavior. Primary data are collected using a self-administered questionnaire with the samples comprised 186 students. The findings show that all the financial literacy and parent socialization have a positive relationship with money management; meanwhile, peer influences and self-control have a negative relationship with money management. This is because the majority of students admit they cannot control their self in managing their money. In this study, parent socialization has a significant relationship with money management which signifies that parents are playing essential roles in ensuring their children to establish money management. In practical, this study can contribute to the parents in providing their children to foster sound money management. Besides, Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional (National Higher Education Fund Corporation) PTPTN should monitor the loan, and management process and arrange motivational program so that students can more focus on the educational expense.

Therefore, this study aims to examine the relationships between financial literacy, saving behavior, a lack of self-control, family financial socialization, and investment awareness. Further, it investigates the moderating role of both family financial socialization and the lack of self-control in these relationships. Employing a quantitative study technique and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), we analyzed a sample of 409 students representing young adults at King Faisal University, specifically in the School of Business. Our results indicate that financial literacy, saving behavior, and family financial socialization are significantly and positively related to investment awareness. Interestingly and as expected, a lack of self-control negatively and significantly affects investment awareness. For the moderating impact, it was found that the connection between financial literacy, saving behavior, and investment awareness is positively and strongly moderated by family financial socialization. Likewise, a lack of self-control significantly and negatively moderated the association between financial literacy, saving behavior, and investment awareness. The results of this study provide substantial implications for regulators, educational organizations, individuals, and their families.

TI  - Does culture empower inclusive finance? Empirical investigation into small business in Cameroon
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - The issue of culture is becoming ever more interesting, especially when interconnected with other business factors like finance. Although intriguing, the relationship between culture and finance has long been neglected. Unlike existing research, this article aims at assessing the impact of culture on financial inclusion and financial literacy among Cameroonian small business managers. In this quantitative investigation, the indices are built using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the estimation is done using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The data used is from a research survey on 161 small enterprises in the cities of Douala, Bafoussam, Foumban, Foumbot, and Dschang. The findings demonstrate that organizational culture, in contrast to its social component, is positively and strongly associated with financial literacy and financial inclusion. Additionally, firm and manager variables like age, turnover variation, and education level significantly explain these financial variables. Thus, it is essential to promote organizational culture in Cameroonian businesses.

TI  - Entrepreneurship as a Neglected Pitfall in Future Finnish Teachers' Readiness to Teach 21st Century Competencies and Financial Literacy: Expectancies, Values, and Capability
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine entrepreneurship in the context of future Finnish teachers' readiness to teach 21st century (broad-based) competencies. Teachers' self-efficacy in teaching entrepreneurial skills and financial matters is vital for their pupils to actively participate and flourish in future society. The study utilized survey data of future teachers' expectancy-values in teaching seven broad-based competencies of the current national curriculum and their financial literacy. Future teachers expressed high interest in all competencies but reported the least self-efficacy and highest cost in teaching ICT as well as working life and entrepreneurship competencies. Teaching self-efficacy (TSE) in entrepreneurial competencies was predicted by subjective evaluations of financial capability and TSE in consumer skills. Teaching STEM subjects as well as male gender were related to better objective financial knowledge. We discuss the implications of observed financial capability, lack in self-efficacy, and high experienced cost of teaching these competencies. Support for future teachers' readiness to teach working life skills, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy through phenomenon-based school subject collaboration, formal teacher training, and digital applications are emphasized.

TI  - Keep your customer knowledgeable: financial advisors as educators
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - Educational programmes aimed at increasing financial literacy are typically scarcely effective or have relatively quick 'decay' periods. In this paper, I provide evidence that financial advisors are an effective way to increase investors' financial awareness. I check this relationship using three measures of financial literacy: basic, advanced and overall; and also test different typologies of advisors. Results indicate that financial advisors have a significant educational role; in particular, the presence of independent financial advisors tends to increase the 'advanced' financial literacy of their clients. The study has potentially important policy implications, as it provides robust evidence that investors' financial literacy can be increased in a gradual and stable way that does not directly affect public funds.

TI  - Female workers' readiness for retirement planning: an evidence from Indonesia
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of demographical factors (age, education and income); psychological factors which are future time perspective (FTP) and financial risk tolerance (FRT); along with financial literacy on retirement planning among female workers in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach This study applies a quantitative approach, where primary data was acquired through online surveys to 529 workers in various locations in Indonesia. After data cleaning, the final sample size was 304. The PLS-SEM technique was utilised to assess the structural model in the study. Findings The results of this study show that income affects an individual's perspective towards the future. Financial literacy is confirmed to have a direct effect on retirement planning activity. Furthermore, financial literacy appears to be a significant mediator between demographical factors and FTP in affecting retirement planning. An individual's acceptance towards risk is also affected by financial literacy. Practical implications The general public, especially female workers group who have no retirement funds, need to be educated on financial literacy. The government might need to encourage other parties and work together to financially educate the public, specifically regarding investments for retirement planning. Originality/value Most previous studies on retirement planning focused on demographical factors in general, and not specifically on a certain group. Filling the gap of existing studies, this study specifically discusses retirement planning done by female workers in Indonesia. Women's role as a workforce, with their psychological conditions and financial literacy, makes for an interesting topic to be studied further in terms of retirement planning.

TI  - Do business trainings for audit committees matter in organizations? Focusing on earnings management
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - This paper examines whether the increase in financial literacy of audit committee (AC) members induced by business trainings leads to the decrease in firms' earnings management, the act of misrepresenting the firms' financial performance. Using a novel hand-collected dataset of Korean listed companies for the period of 2018-2020, we find that business trainings increase the effectiveness of ACs by enhancing the ability to detect earnings management. Also, our results reveal that the positive effect of business trainings is more pronounced for AC members who lack financial literacy, which suggests that training programs are effective for less financially sophisticated members.

TI  - Retirement Financial Behaviour: How Important Is Being Financially Literate?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER POLICY
AB  - Using Item Response Theory to analyse survey data from a representative sample of 551 Swedish citizens, a new 16-question measure of fact-based financial literacy is developed and validated. Uni-dimensionality of the measure is verified, and expected correlations are observed with an existing measure of fact-based financial literacy, a measure of subjective financial literacy or confidence. and age, gender, and income. A significant impact of fact-based and subjective financial literacy are found on three time-ordered stages of individuals' retirement behaviour: planning, saving, and investment management. It is concluded that policies increasing final literacy are important in different phases of the life cycle.

TI  - Hubris or talent? Estimating the role of overconfidence in Chinese households' investment decisions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - We document the extent to which overconfidence in one's financial literacy (FL overconfidence) plays a role in households' reported financial risk aversion and their actual investment behavior, using data from the China Household Finance Survey. We measure FL overconfidence by estimating the gap between people's self-reported financial literacy and their objectively measured financial knowledge. Our results indicate that FL overconfidence is negatively associated with self-reported financial risk aversion. Additionally, FL overconfidence is positively associated with the likelihood of having a brokerage account, holding risky financial instruments (other than just stock), and a proportion of assets allocated towards risky assets. We then use machine learning methods to predict which factors are most important in determining households' risky investment decisions. We find that overconfidence plays a significant predictive role. Our work signals that households' risky investments may be driven by biased optimism about their own financial know-how rather than their actual knowledge. We conclude that financial literacy programs should not only teach financial concepts but also make program participants aware of their own biases.

TI  - THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT AND FINANCIAL LITERACY FOR PAVING A PATH TOWARDS FINANCIAL WELL-BEING
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study aims to develop an original financial intelligence quotient (FIQ) measurement conceptual model, including guidelines for adequately handling personal finances in four developed areas to serve as benchmarks of financial intelligence. Four hypotheses were raised, one of them consists of four parts. Methods used: a questionnaire to determine how well a person's financial decisions comply with financial behaviour guidelines, Cronbach's Alpha coefficient to determine the internal consistency of the scales used in the questionnaire, Spearman correlation coefficient to determine the linear dependence between the variables, a linear regression model was developed to substantiate the hypothesis, the MannWhitney-Wilcoxon rank-sum criterion, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to choose the data distribution according to the normal distribution, descriptive statistics, the Kruskal-Wallis test to support the hypothesis. The results show that an individual's FIQ influences financial decision-making in essential areas of personal finance management and varies due to education but is not dependent on gender and age. Research limitations: The study focuses only on FI and its impact on the economic well-being of Lithuanian students; the study uses one-year data; data sets for different age groups were not the same size; and the data was not distributed in groups according to the normal distribution.

TI  - Investors' Behavioral Intention in Mutual Fund Investments in India: Applicability of Theory of Planned Behavior
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - This study examines the impact of subjective norm, attitude and perceived control behavior (financial literacy) on investors' behavioral intention to invest in mutual funds based on the theory of planned behavior. We have applied Structural Equation Modelling - path analysis to examine the influence of financial literacy, subjective norms, and attitude on the behavioral investment intention of mutual fund investors. The study's findings indicate that Investors' choice to invest in a mutual fund is positively prejudiced by their subjective norms, attitude, and financial literacy. Subjective norms significantly influence investment decisions more than attitude and financial literacy. Age, gender, and level of education have no moderating effect on attitude, subjective norms, and financial literacy. The study is proved to be unique to the literature on behavioral finance. The study's findings are eye-opening as the investment intentions in the mutual fund are influenced by subjective norms, indirectly signaling that investors lack awareness of mutual fund investment.

TI  - Determinants of knowledge of personal loans' total costs: How price consciousness, financial literacy, purchase recency and frequency work together
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
CP  - Annual Conference of Business Association for Latin American Studies (BALAS) - From Starting Up to Sustained Growth - Challenges and Opportunities for Latin American Entrepreneurs
AB  - Politicians and analysts frequently call for stricter regulation of personal loans. Two variables that are easy to measure, and therefore easy to include in regulations and public policy, are purchase recency and purchase frequency. Politicians and analysts also regularly demand an increase in price consciousness and financial literacy among customers. This paper aims to analyze how these four factors work together to generate perceived and actual knowledge of the personal loans' total costs. An empirical study employing a survey administered through personal in-home interviews was carried out. This paper shows how perceived and actual knowledge of personal loans' total costs are affected differently by these four factors. The results are discussed, and implications for regulators, managers, and researchers are presented.

TI  - The Role of a Manager's Intangible Capabilities in Resource Acquisition and Sustainable Competitive Performance
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The answer to the challenging question, Should one either invest in tangible resources or intangible resources/capabilities? is still fragmented. In prior studies, more emphasis is given to tangible resources, while intangible resources have comparatively received minor attention, despite their significant role in the success of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Particularly the role of the intangible skills; intellectual capital, financial literacy (FL), and business experience (BE) in resource acquisition and sustainable competitive performance has missed in prior studies. Grounded on the resource-based view and upper echelon theory, this study examines the role of intellectual capital in sustainable competitive performance with a mediating role of resource acquisition. This research also assesses the moderating role of financial literacy and business experience between intellectual capital and resource acquisition. Data are collected through structured questionnaires from 384 owners/managers of Pakistani SMEs. After analyzing the data through structural equation modeling (SEM), the results indicate that intellectual capital helps managers in acquiring valuable resources, which in turn enhance sustainable competitive performance. Resource acquisition partially mediates the relation between intellectual capital and sustainable competitive performance. Financial literacy is a significant predictor of resource acquisition, but it does not significantly moderate the relation between intellectual capital and sustainable competitive performance. Business experience significantly boosts the acquisition of resources and strengthens the path between intellectual capital and resource acquisition. SMEs should encourage their managers to acquire unique, rare, and immutable external resources in the turbulent markets.

TI  - Entrepreneurs on their financial literacy: evidence from the Netherlands
T2  - VENTURE CAPITAL
AB  - Using a representative survey of Dutch entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals, (i) we measure their subjective financial knowledge and the extent to which they ask for advice when managing their companies, and (ii) we examine whether subjective financial knowledge and the demand for advice are related to the firm economic performance. We find that the respondents feel more comfortable with accounting subjects than they do with strategic ones, of which they feel that they know the least. Entrepreneurs with a greater extent of financial knowledge are more likely to report a higher gross margin and higher revenue growth for their firm. These entrepreneurs are also less likely to seek advice and to delegate financial decisions. Seeking professional advice does not increase the likelihood of an entrepreneur having better performance. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs' degree of financial knowledge is related to the success of their businesses, while seeking advice is not significantly correlated with better firm performance.

TI  - Increased financial literacy and inclusion indexes versus the number of unlicensed financial institutions in Indonesia
T2  - FORESIGHT
AB  - Purpose This study aims to provide and find an alternative solution to achieving literacy indexes and financial inclusion that exceeded the target in 2019. Design/methodology/approach This research uses a normative research type. Secondary data becomes the primary data and uses the method of qualitative data analysis. Findings The results showed that public literacy and financial institutions' inclusion were dependent on public trust in financial institutions. The Financial Services Authorities' (FSA) arrangement's weakness lies in the limited scope of the FSA's authority in carrying out legal actions against unlicensed financial institutions and the low critical power of the community in choosing a credible financial institution. Research limitations/implications Based on the research findings, results are expected to have implications for the concept of FSA's authority. Practical implications Based on the research findings, results are expected to have implications for expanding the FSA's authority to conduct oversight of financial institutions so that the high literacy and financial inclusion of the public can achieve public welfare. Social implications The research implication for the community is that the results of this study find weaknesses in the financial literacy and inclusion policies to find the causes of the problems and find solutions to these problems. The practical research implications are for policymakers; research results can be used as a basis for determining solutions to problems in regulations. The results of this study can also have implications for the development of a boy of knowledge in the field of business economic law, especially economic law. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no researches that have similarities with this paper.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Using survey data from 730 undergraduates in Vietnam, we find that learning motivation and its components, especially self-efficacy, finance learning value, and achievement goals, significantly correlate with students' financial literacy performance. In addition, these correlations are moderated by student characteristics, among which academic seniority, university type, parents' education, and extra math study during high school matter the most. Our results raise significant implications to policymakers, researchers, and educators that include understanding the role of motivation and incorporating it in financial literacy education and intervention programs and considering the moderation roles that individuals' characteristics play in the motivation-financial literacy link. We encourage more research in these areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION IN BUSINESS
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to analyse the effect of financial learning quality (FLQ) and parental socioeconomic status (SES) on the financial self-efficacy (FSE) of undergraduate Accounting students in Bali with students' financial literacy (FL) serving a mediator. Design/methodology/approach This research used a quantitative design with ex post facto approach and path analysis technique. Research data were collected by administering a financial literacy test on, and questionnaires distributed to, the sample selected using a purposive random sampling technique. The research sample consisted of undergraduate Accounting students in Bali who were in their fourth or sixth semesters, numbering 518. Findings The research results show that financial learning quality and parental socioeconomic status directly influenced financial literacy. Financial learning quality and socioeconomic status did not have any direct influence on financial self-efficacy, but financial literacy directly affected financial self-efficacy. Additionally, the results also show that financial literacy was able to mediate learning quality's and socioeconomic status' relationships with financial self-efficacy. Originality/value Previous studies predominantly investigated the factors that affect financial literacy in students. There has been a small body of research that addresses financial self-efficacy, especially in Accounting students. Therefore, this research makes a contribution to the knowledge on factors that influence, either directly or indirectly, FSE in students with financial literacy serving as a mediator.

TI  - Financial Literacy Level: An Empirical Study on Savings, Credit and Budget Management Habits in High School Students
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - In the majority of the countries, have exposed the need for people to have a higher level of financial education, which translates into better habits for saving and investing, in addition, they will have better decisions for the management of their personal finances which is translates into financial well-being, therefore, the aim of this work was to evaluate the financial literacy of high school students about saving habits, budgeting and credit; as well as, identify if it differs by gender. To do this, the hypothetical-deductive method is used, based on the seminal works of Bernheim, Garrett and Maki (2001) and Lusardi and Mitchell (2011). The sample is non-probabilistic by self-determination, therefore 256 students from four institutions participated in the Veracruz context, were surveyed. For the data descriptive analysis, in order to describe the main frequencies in each saving, credit and budget indicator, the cross table's procedure was carried out. To test hypothesis about gender differences, one-way ANOVA and Levene's test was applied. The main findings show slight differences between gender in some fundamental aspects of saving, credit and the use and management of the budget.

Organizations can make strategic investments in production factors to develop competitive advantages because they have access to financial resources. This study investigated how financial literacy, innovativeness, and environmental sustainability influence the sustainability of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This was set as the primary objective in order to better understand the nature of the impact of financial literacy and innovation on the sustainability of SME firms. To test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied using data collected from 300 small businesses firms in China. The results revealed that financial literacy and innovativeness significantly influence small firms' sustainability. Additionally, social inclusion significantly affects small firms' sustainability, and sequentially has a significant effect on their performance. Research findings suggested that small businesses incorporate sustainability models into their operations and enhance financial knowledge in order to maintain sustainability.

TI  - Trading Gamification and Investor Behavior
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - We study the effect of gamification on retail traders' behavior using a randomized online experiment. Participants with lower financial literacy prefer platforms with hedonic gamification elements, such as confetti and achievement badges. On average, hedonic gamification increases trading volume by 5.17%. However, the difference in trading activity between gamified and nongamified platforms is driven primarily by self-selection (70%) rather than gamification (30%). Participants who prefer hedonic gamification exhibit noisy trading strategies, whereas those favoring nongamified platforms display stronger contrarian behavior. Further, price trend notifications enhance learning for investors with accurate beliefs, but they reinforce trading mistakes for those with incorrect beliefs.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of sociodemographic characteristics and financial education on saving behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY
AB  - Purpose The objective of this study is to explore the effects of financial literacy level and risk aversion on the saving behavior. The literature review showed dialectical results. Therefore, this study attempts to clarify the debatable of these results by studying the mediating effect of risk aversion on the relationships between demographics determinants and saving behavior moderated by the effect of the financial literacy level. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from the University of Normandy; the study sample included 516 respondents representing different segments of French households. The structural equation analysis was utilized to control the impact of financial literacy as a moderate variable and the risk aversion as a mediator variable among the link between sociodemographic factors and saving behavior. Findings The results demonstrated that there were significant effects of demographics factors on risk aversion. Moreover, financial literacy moderates the relationships between risk aversion and saving behavior. Research limitations/implications The major limitation of this research is the small size of the study sample. This paper is restricted to French households. Future financial education training should cover the European context. Practical implications This study provides further evidence that financial literacy should be considered an important factor for improving household well-being. The paper encourages governments and financial institutions to create a national financial education program. Originality/value This paper is the first attempt to employ a sample of low-income households after financial education training in the French context.

TI  - Measuring financial divide in the rural environment. The potential role of the digital transformation of finance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - Financial inclusion, which means the promotion of an affordable, timely and adequate access to a wide range of regulated financial products and services, as well as its use by all the segments of the society, is a high potential tool that may contribute to the development of the rural environment, while its absence could in turn cause a major harm. The availability of a sufficient level of financial literacy, which can be defined as the ability to understand financial concepts and risks, as well as the motivation and trust to use it when making financial decisions, is frequently deemed to be a need to reach financial inclusion by the academic literature. Financial literacy is, in turn, influenced by different variables, such as the degree of rural or urban predominance, the level of education and the available income in the household. This paper analyses the impact of such factors on financial literacy. The degree of financial literacy tends to be lower in rural environments, with limited incomes and poorer educational backgrounds, which creates a vicious circle that potentially worsens the situation of what has been called the empty Spain. Considering the importance of financial literacy to reach financial inclusion, we remark the potential of digital transformation as a valuable tool to break this negative trend in the less populated Spanish regions, and so, a cornerstone for the regenerative development of the Spanish rural areas.

TI  - Why walk away from an easy gain in wealth? Evidence from a UK stock option plan
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - The paper examines the extent and potential reasons for non-exercise of 'in the money' stock options, drawing on employee-level data from the UK Save-As-You-Earn stock option plan. 14 per cent of participants choose not to exercise, and failure to exercise in these circumstances can be costly in terms of foregone increases in wealth. Lesser experience of the option plan, perceived lack of financial knowledge, and greater reliance on friends for advice is associated with failure to exercise. These findings offer challenges to the use of sophisticated reward and benefit schemes by companies when potential participants lack financial capabilities, and add to the literature by showing that financial literacy can remain problematic even when employees have surmounted initial obstacles to joining plans.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Pension systems increasingly require active involvement from their participants for retirement planning. This leads to the need for a proper level of financial literacy to foster decision-making. Based on the Chilean Social Protection Survey and the Regional Development Index data, specific characteristics related to the region of residence, such as the quality of life, access to job opportunities, and available connectivity tools, are seen to have a positive impact on pension knowledge. Hence, these regional level results provide inputs to policymakers for developing appropriate policies regarding pension knowledge.

TI  - A STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODEL OF FINANCIAL MSMES PERFORMANCE: MODERATION BY ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS
T2  - JIMS8M-THE JOURNAL OF INDIAN MANAGEMENT & STRATEGY
AB  - mercialSale dated17-Nov-2020on In order to remain creditworthy and investable, the entrepreneurs should be able to produce high quality and standardised financial information on a regular basis. This information can be fed further into formal business plans in order to optimise management decisions and improve business processes. The critical question that needs to be answered is: Do the entrepreneurs possess adequate financial literacycompetencies, to gather and utilize the financial information, to achieve their business objectives? Does their level of financial literacy significantly explain their use of information technology for gaining competitive advantage? With the introduction of GST, there has been a change in the accounting environment of business through increased usage of computerised accounting systems (CAS) and heavy reliance on accountants for this purpose. This paper specifically aims to assess the financial literacy skills of MSME entrepreneurs in creation and utilisation of financial information using CAS and digital skills, to achieve better financial management and control over business activities. The structural model developed in this paper confirmed the positive association of financial accounting practices and use of IT with the business performance of MSMEs. Since entrepreneurial skills are intended to complement the financial literacy competencies of entrepreneurs, the paper also examined and confirmed the moderating effect of entrepreneurial skills on financial accounting practices and business performance relationship. 2 N a

TI  - Role of Gender in Predicting Determinant of Financial Risk Tolerance
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This research was conducted to determine whether the determinants of financial risk tolerance varied by gender or whether the same factors influenced the risk-taking capacities of both genders. This study utilised personality types (Type-A and Type-B), financial literacy, and six demographic parameters, including marital status, age, education, income, occupation, and the number of dependents, as independent variables, and gender as a dividing variable. In order to conduct this study, information was gathered from 671 investors. The financial risk tolerance of male investors was determined by six out of eight independent factors (personality type, financial literacy, marital status, income, occupation, and the number of dependents). However, just four factors (personality type, financial literacy, marital status, and income) have a substantial impact on the financial risk tolerance of female investors.

TI  - MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS IN FINANCE EDUCATION: CLUSTER ANALYSIS FOR OECD COUNTRIES
T2  - MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS
AB  - Financial literacy and financial education is a concept that helps people in orientation in both the financial markets and the area of personal finances. Financial literacy can be acknowledged through financial education. Financial education should enable individuals to develop their decision-making competencies. It includes issues such are the understanding of money, how to deal with them within the risk of their investment. The issue of financial literacy for primary and secondary school students has been monitored over a long time through several evaluations. In this case, it is very well known the PISA rating, which was lastly performed in the first half of 2018. It represents the ability of how to use skills and knowledge in managing one's financial resources while achieving maximum prosperity. Financial education should enable individuals to develop their decision-making competencies related to money. The paper aims to perform a cluster analysis based on the data available from the PISA 2015 measurement in selected OECD countries. The analysis represents results in a cluster of countries. The study analysed of financial literacy 15-year-olds students. The study observed similar research results in both the area of financial literacy and mathematical literacy. From the selected PISA 2015 test results applied through cluster analysis, we decided that the Slovak students were placed in a cluster together with students from Spain, Chile and Lithuania. The study observed the quality of vocational education and training is criticized mainly by employers because the area of education is inadequately responsive to labour market needs. Employee stress that it is inadequately linked to practice. Vocational training is inadequate compared to general schools. The methodology we recommend should also be applied to the results of the PISA 2018 evaluation, which are not yet available to the public. We would like to address this issue in future. The cluster analysis helps to reveal competitiveness in the area of financial literacy. The results of our research within Slovak students were based on a similar level of financial literacy among Slovak pupils as in Spain, Chile and Lithuania.

TI  - Breaking the cycle: The mediating effects of reading, mathematical and ICT literacy skills on financial success in youth
T2  - REVIEW OF EDUCATION
AB  - For young people, financial literacy is important because they face financial decisions that can have significant consequences throughout their lives, such as investing in a college education or a business, shopping, buying books or computer games. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between the financial literacy levels of young people and their perceived ICT competence, reading and mathematical literacy, which are measurable and observable phenomena. The research data were obtained from the 2018 PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) database, officially published by the OECD. The participants of this study were 15-year-old students from 15 different countries that participated in the PISA programme in 2018. Mathematical and reading literacy were found to be an important variable affecting the financial literacy performance of young people. However, ICT competencies did not significantly affect the financial literacy performance of young people. Additionally, this study tested the mediating effects of reading literacy, mathematical literacy and perceived ICT competence variables on financial literacy.

T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Rising uncertainty has drawn researchers' attention towards households' anti-risk capacities. Using data from the China Household Finance Survey covering 2019 to 2021, this study investigates the impact of financial literacy on household financial resilience. We measure household financial resilience by analyzing inter-period variations in liquid assets pre- and postCovid-19, coupled with constructing a sensitivity index. Our analysis indicates that financial literacy significantly enhances financial resilience through the wealth effect and risk mitigation effect. This study highlights the critical role of financial literacy in mitigating risks and accelerating recovery from financial disturbances.

TI  - Gender, Education, and Financial Socialization as Determinants of Financial Knowledge: An Empirical Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The main aim of the paper is to assess the level of financial literacy among business students. It further aims to investigate the role of external factors that may determine financial literacy. The external factors considered in this study are gender, grade point average, specialization, financial education, and financial socialization. Standard scales such as the Test of Financial Literacy, the Big Three, and other instruments were adapted to measure Financial Knowledge. Further, the study also explored relationships between several factors and the financial knowledge of students. These factors included a student's gender, specialization, number of finance or related courses studied, current Grade Point Average, and financial socialization. A total number of 303 valid responses were received through an online questionnaire administered to business students studying in a public university in the country. Statistical tests namely independent samples t-Test, one-way ANOVA, and correlation analysis were performed in SPSS 28.0. Results show that the overall financial knowledge of students is above average. Gender, number of finance or related courses, and financial socialization do not exhibit any significant relationship with financial knowledge. Current GPA and specialization show significant relationships. The findings of this study have important sectoral and research implications.

TI  - The Impact of Housing Tenure on Financial Wellbeing Among Elderly Australians
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - Homeownership rates are declining in many countries and the potential impact on financial wellbeing is largely unknown. Additionally, the potential impact may be expected to be larger for women than men, as women tend to value homeownership more than men. Finally, financial literacy may play a role on financial wellbeing via a positive effect onto housing tenure (i.e., renter, mortgagor, outright homeowner). On the basis of a community sample of older Australians (N = 2608), we tested a model with housing tenure as a predictor of financial wellbeing, controlling for the effects of wealth, income, age, and marital status. Housing tenure yielded a significant, positive, unique effect onto financial wellbeing. We failed to find evidence that the effect of housing tenure on financial wellbeing was larger for women than men. Finally, financial literacy was associated positively with financial wellbeing; and, the effect was entirely mediated positively by housing tenure, wealth and income. We conclude that outright homeownership may accord approximately 10% greater financial wellbeing than renting (and approximate to 6% greater than mortgaged) in Australian seniors. Furthermore, higher levels of financial literacy may play a unique role in facilitating better housing tenure.

TI  - The Impact of Financial Education for Youth in Ghana
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Governments and non-governmental organizations promote school-based financial literacy programs as means to instill financial behaviors that can persist through adulthood. We conduct a randomized trial of two financial literacy education programs in government-run Ghanaian primary and junior high schools. The first integrated both financial and social education, while the second included only financial education. Our study finds that after nine months, both programs had positive impacts on self-reported savings at school relative to the control group, but there were no statistically significant increases in aggregate savings nor in hypothesized mechanisms such as attitudes, preferences, or knowledge. The financial education-only treatment led to a weakly statistically significant increase in child labor relative to the control group, although the difference in impact between the two treatment groups was not statistically significant. The lack of short-term effects of these programs on financial behaviors and attitudes indicate that alternative program designs should be evaluated to understand whether and how these outcomes can be influenced among students in this age group.

T2  - EUROMED JOURNAL OF BUSINESS
AB  - PurposeThe objective of this study is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the consumer payment behavior in Italy by correlating financial literacy with digital payment awareness, examining media anxiety and financial security, and including a gender analysis.Design/methodology/approachConsumers' attitudes toward cashless payments were investigated using an online survey conducted from November 2021 to February 2022 on a sample of 836 Italian citizens by considering the behavioral characteristics and aspects of financial literacy. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypotheses and to determine whether the model was invariant by gender.FindingsThe analysis showed that the fear of contracting COVID-19 and the level of financial literacy had a direct influence on the payment behavior of Italians, which was completely different in its weighting. Fear due to the spread of news regarding the pandemic in the media indirectly influenced consumers' noncash attitude. The preliminary results of the gender multigroup analysis showed that cashless payment was the same in the male and female subpopulations.Originality/valueThis research is noteworthy because of its interconnected examination. It examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's payment choices, assessed their knowledge, and considered the influence of media-induced anxiety. By combining these factors, the study offered an analysis from a gender perspective, providing understanding of how financial behaviors were shaped during the pandemic.

T2  - FINANZARCHIV
AB  - Using a multilevel analysis with data from PISA 2012, we find that the differences in financial literacy of 15-year-old students are explained by both individual and school characteristics. This paper finds that the financial education is positively related to students' financial literacy scores when it is taught as a cross-curricular subject and as part of business or economics courses, and to a lesser extent as part of mathematics and as an extracurricular activity. Also, math and reading abilities, and holding a bank account and a prepaid debit card, contribute positively to the development of financial literacy, while financial unfamiliarity contributes negatively.

TI  - Household Financial Fragility During COVID-19: the Power of Financially Literate Women
T2  - ZAGREB INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & BUSINESS
AB  - This paper analyses household financial fragility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the barging theory in households' decision-making, this paper proposes that women's financial literacy and their involvement in paid and unpaid work will influence family financial fragility in times of crisis. The results show that women's financial literacy, their participation in the labour market, and their financial independence have a significant and positive effect on the family's financial situation during the pandemic. Moreover, the level of women's unpaid work was identified as a significant element that jeopardizes family financial stability. The results further support the bargaining power theory regarding a better understanding of the complexity of decision-making within households. The results point to a new channel for preserving family financial stability, through the improvement of women's financial literacy and the development of institutional and social support for their participation in the labour market.

TI  - Barking up the wrong tree: Return-chasing in 401(k) plans
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper examines investors' retirement savings allocation using a hand-collected dataset on 401(k) plans. We find that 83% of investors in our sample hold only 39% of total assets and follow a return-chasing strategy. In contrast, the remaining 17% of wealthy investors with relatively higher financial literacy follow CAPM alpha. This difference between the two investor groups explains why fund flows respond to returns at the plan level but to CAPM alpha at the aggregated fund level. Return-chasing by unwealthy investors is not optimal, as it significantly underperforms a strategy that passively invests in the existing funds in their plans.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Do Nudges Reduce Disparities? Choice Architecture Compensates for Low Consumer Knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB  - Choice architecture tools, commonly known as nudges, powerfully impact decisions and can improve welfare. Yet it is unclear who is most impacted by nudges. If nudge effects are moderated by socioeconomic status (SES), these differential effects could increase or decrease disparities across consumers. Using field data and several preregistered studies, the authors demonstrate that consumers with lower SES, domain knowledge, and numerical ability are impacted more by a wide variety of nudges. As a result, "good nudges" designed to increase selection of superior options reduced choice disparities, improving choices more among consumers with lower SES, lower financial literacy, and lower numeracy than among those with higher levels of these variables. Compared with "good nudges," "bad nudges" designed to facilitate selection of inferior options exacerbated choice disparities. These results generalized across real retirement decisions, different nudges, and different decision domains. Across studies, the authors tested different explanations of why SES, domain knowledge, and numeracy moderate nudges. The results suggest that nudges are a useful tool for those who wish to reduce disparities. The research concludes with a discussion of implications for marketing firms and segmentation.

TI  - Money Knowledge or Money Myths? Results of a population survey on money and the monetary order
T2  - ARCHIVES EUROPEENNES DE SOCIOLOGIE
AB  - People use money in everyday life in ubiquitous ways. In addition, they know that money has quite different and multiple meanings in different social contexts, depending on the situation in which it is used. That said, what do people actually know about money, money creation, money backing and the institutional foundations of the monetary order? While contributions in the rapidly extending field of financial literacy have empirically studied people's knowledge about mathematical and financial issues, people's knowledge about the functioning of the money system and monetary institutions remained mostly unexplored. To improve our understanding of people's knowledge of the money system and the most important money institutions, we questioned 2,000 individuals in Austria using a standardized population survey. In this paper, after a short critical review of the sociology of money and the literature on financial literacy, we present and critically discuss the results of the survey. We found that, independently of age, gender, education and income, people know very little about the money system or money institutions and mostly believe in money myths, such as the notion that money is still backed by gold. Finally, we discuss our empirical findings against the backdrop of the state of research on the sociology of money (1).

TI  - Literacy, profile, and determinants of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin: Survey results
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR BUSINESS
AB  - This study attempts to assess individuals' Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin literacy, and then identifies different profiles based on the literacy levels of these cryptocurrencies, and further investigates whether financial literacy explains Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin literacy. Using a sample from higher learning institutions in Malaysia, the results indicate that individuals exhibit higher knowledge on Bitcoin compared to Ethereum and Litecoin. Cluster analysis revealed two clusters, where the high-cryptocurrency-literacy cluster (high in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin literacy) has a distinct demographic profile and higher financial literacy than the low-cryptocurrency-literacy cluster (low in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin literacy). Financial literacy is shown to explain Bitcoin and Ethereum literacy, but not Litecoin literacy.

TI  - Limited asset market participation and fiscal sustainability
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
AB  - We examine the implications of limited stock market participation (the stylized fact that only a fraction of households directly own stocks) for economic growth and, in particular, fiscal sustainability. Constructing an overlapping generations model where (1) individuals can choose between two types of savings (i.e., physical capital with high returns but costly to hold and bank deposits with low returns but no costs), and (2) banks invest part of their total deposits in physical capital and use the rest to underwrite government debt, we show the following. First, an increase in the average level of an individual's financial literacy worsens fiscal sustainability while promoting economic growth under plausible parameter values. Second, if banks decrease (resp. increase) the number of government bonds they underwrite, fiscal sustainability improves (resp. worsens) when the average financial literacy of individuals is relatively low.

TI  - The relationships between market orientation, learning orientation, fi nancial literacy, on the knowledge competence, innovation, and performance of small and medium textile industries in Java and Bali
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide new practical and theoretical insights on how SMEs adjust and further develop business competencies, innovations and performance by utilizing market orientation, learning orientation behaviors, and financial literacy. The data was collected from manufacturing small and medium enterprises (SMEs) of textile products that had several employees between 5 and 99 people in the province of Bali and Jawa, Indonesia, in 2016. Central Java as one of the provinces that has various types of creative centers has a role big as a reference model for other provinces in the development of MSMEs. The results of the study confirm the influence of financial literacy on the performance and innovation of creative MSMEs in Central Java. This has implications that with good financial literacy, it is expected that MSMEs will be able to make the right management and financial decisions to improve performance and innovation. With this finding, it is expected that significant support will emerge from the government as a regulator, academics as educators, the private sector as a catalyst, and the community as a driver for the development of financial literacy at MSMEs in Central Java. The lack of studies in the existing literature underscores the potential contribution of this subsequent study.

TI  - Credit card behavior, financial styles, and heuristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - The paper makes four contributions. First, the paper provides new data and findings about credit card usage segmentation in respect to spending and borrowing behavior. Second, it sets the new findings against the backdrop of the newly emerging literature on financial literacy. A great variability occurs in financial literacy across American consumers. Third, the paper describes fast and frugal heuristics aimed to help consumers make effective, and in some cases better, budgeting decisions when they use credit cards. Fourth, the paper describes the introduction of a new set of online financial tools, offered by a large credit card company, which consumers are now using to make decisions about their spending and borrowing, and links these tools to the heuristics under discussion. Fast and frugal heuristics are likely to be especially valuable to consumers with low confidence in their online skills. Notably, 25% of credit cardholders report that they have low confidence using online technology to manage their finances, with the corresponding figure being 44% for those most at risk.

TI  - Consumer Financial Capability and Financial Satisfaction
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine associations between consumer financial capability and financial satisfaction. Consumer financial capability was measured by three sets of variables, perceived financial capability, financial literacy, and financial behavior. Using data from the 2009 US State-by-State Survey of Financial Capability, the results indicated the positive association between perceived financial capability and financial satisfaction. The findings suggested that desirable financial behavior increases while risky financial behavior decreases financial satisfaction. Subjective financial literacy was also found to contribute positively to financial satisfaction. The positive association between objective financial literacy and financial satisfaction was found in bivariate analyses but not in multivariate analyses. The results imply that to enhance consumer financial well-being, consumer financial education programs should emphasize action taking and encourage consumers to avoid risky financial behavior, engage in desirable financial behavior, and improve financial self-efficacy.

TI  - FACTORS INFLUENCING FINANCIAL PLANNING FOR MARRIAGE AMONGST YOUNG MALAYSIAN COUPLES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - Financial planning for marriage contributes to happier, more satisfying and longer-lasting unions. However, there is increasing evidence that young Malaysian couples are burdened by excessive debts and have a tendency to overspend on their wedding. Based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, the current study investigates key factors - financial literacy, attitude towards money, attitude towards debt, financial goals and social influence - that are likely to influence the degree of financial planning for marriage undertaken by married and soon-to-be-married couples. The study also examines the mediating role of financial literacy on the relationships between the aforementioned key factors and financial planning for marriage. The study collected data from a sample of 201 respondents recruited via purposive sampling and used a bootstrapped partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach for data analysis. The results showed that (i) financial literacy positively influences financial planning for marriage; (ii) attitude towards money, financial goals and social influence positively influence both financial literacy and financial planning for marriage; (iii) attitude towards debt has a negative influence on financial planning for marriage but no influence on financial literacy; and (iv) financial literacy has a mediating effect. The findings highlight the importance of financial counselling, education as well as discipline in bringing about successful marriages.

TI  - Does it pay to invest? The personal equity risk premium and stock market participation
T2  - JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE
AB  - Individuals' stock market participation depends on the risk-return trade-off they expect to achieve. We find that the expected economic benefits of investing are highly heterogeneous. We define the personal equity risk premium (PERP) as the difference between an individual's expectation of returns and personal opportunity cost of capital. Higher PERP is associated with greater stock market participation. Our results hold after we control for known factors, such as financial literacy, trust, and loss aversion, and are stronger for the level of stock investment. Disentangling PERP shows that both components help explain both stock market participation and the level of participation.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reaching Financial Inclusion: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - Financial inclusion is a vital development policy concern; different combinations and conditions of access to (supply) and use of (demand) financial services may predict levels of financial inclusion. With a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, conducted across 61 countries worldwide, the current research establishes that financial literacy and human development are conditions of high financial inclusion; supply-side drivers, such as bank concentration and bank branches, represent substitutive conditions for attaining high levels of financial inclusion. With separate analyses of a split sample, designating developed and developing countries, the authors also determine that the absence of financial literacy and human development, as demand-side drivers, leads to diminished financial inclusion for both sets of countries. In turn, this research offers novel ideas for achieving more efficient policies to prompt financial inclusion.

TI  - Identifying financially illiterate groups: An international comparison
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Targeted policy interventions are more effective than one-size-fits-all initiatives. This paper proposes the use of k-means cluster analysis to identify vulnerable groups with respect to financial literacy. Using a rich sample of 12 countries, we distinguish 4 groups with varying financial literacy levels, and examine their socio-economic characteristics. The results suggest that individuals in the most vulnerable financially illiterate groups are on average, single, less-educated and unemployed with low incomes. This contrasts with those in the strongest group: individuals with the highest financial knowledge, financial behaviour and financial attitudes scores are on average highly educated males who live together with a partner. They earn a high income and hold several financial products. Integrating these insights into national strategies which promote financial literacy will not only lead to more effective but also to more efficient policy initiatives by focusing on the particular weaknesses of certain subgroups and using the appropriate transmission channels.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Using self-reported retail investor information from a risk-return profile survey, we investigate the determinants of individual return objectives as well as the capacity of investors to achieve them. Controlling for a large set of covariates, we provide empirical evidence that return objectives are related to subjective individual characteristics (such as financial literacy and risk tolerance), some sociodemographic variables (age and education), and recent past trading intensity. Retail investors with higher return objectives perform better than their counterparts who want to avoid any risk of capital loss. The capacity to achieve the return objective, however, decreases as the level of the objective increases. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - We use responses to a self-report survey and matched administrative data to investigate the ef-fects of personality (Big Five traits) and IQ on individuals' stock trading portfolios. Traits have small but significant effects: openness and extraversion are associated with undesirable outcomes whereas conscientiousness is associated beneficially. Higher IQ is associated with lower trading activity but not enhanced investment performance. We postulate these factors influence outcomes in a complex manner, and exert over long timeframes. With portfolio size held constant, financial literacy has little effect. Other factors, such as customer age, portfolio size and portfolio risk, better explain outcomes.

TI  - Who Is Successful in Foreign Exchange Margin Trading? New Survey Evidence from Japan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - We use a 2018 survey of FX margin traders in Japan to investigate which key factors influence their trading performance: socio-demographic and economic situation, investment strategy and trading behaviour, and/or financial literacy. We study this question using general-to-specific modelling and impulse-indicator saturation. First, the data show that variables from all three groups are significant predictors of traders' performance. Second, we find that older traders and those without a specific trading strategy demonstrate lower performance. Performance is higher for those who trade greater amounts, rely more on fundamental analysis, and report having profitable FX trade skills. Third, respondents' subjectively stated claim of having FX trade skills is based on a more advanced understanding of FX trading and a reliance on professional advice. Neither objective financial knowledge nor over/underconfidence play a noteworthy role in the performance of margin traders.

TI  - A proposition to implement inclusive Islamic financial planning in Indonesia through bibliometric analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose In Indonesia, the Islamic Economics and Finance Sector is growing rapidly, but the literature on Islamic financial literacy is still minimal. This study aims to show research opportunities with the theme of Islamic financial literacy, especially inclusive Islamic financial planning through bibliometric analysis of Scopus and connected papers. Design/methodology/approach A comma separated value (CSV) file containing more than 2,000 references meta data was used for analysis on Vos Viewer in the period of 1963-2020. The grouping of network visualization maps is done using six keywords, namely, "Financial Literacy," "Financial Inclusion," "Islamic Financial Literacy," "Financial Planning," "Personal Finance" and "Household Finance." Findings The findings complement the keywords that are generally used as references in the formation of theories regarding inclusive Islamic financial planning. After combining the "ris" file from the connected paper, the most used terms are financial knowledge, financial education, financial behavior, financial decision-making process, financial inclusion, risk sharing and financial discourse. Originality/value The proportion which planned to be applied in Indonesia will differentiate the inclusive Islamic financial planning framework from what has been done before. This study outlines the basis of the relevant literature review in the theme of Islamic financial literacy research, especially inclusive Islamic financial planning.

TI  - The effects of parental involvement in homework: two randomised controlled trials in financial education
T2  - EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper provides causal evidence on the effects of parental involvement on student outcomes in a financial education course based on two randomised controlled trials with a total of 2779 students from grade 8 and 9 in Flanders. Using an experimental design with three treatment groups, the impact of parental involvement in homework is distinguished from the standalone impact of the classroom intervention and homework itself. Intention-to-treat analysis reveals that access to the intervention effectively improves students' financial literacy in the two dimensions of knowledge and behaviour. The classroom intervention combined with a homework assigned to be completed with the parents increases financial literacy by 0.38 standard deviations. On average, the added value of prompting parental involvement in homework is not statistically significant. Yet, stimulating parental involvement has significant positive effects on behaviour for disadvantaged students.

TI  - Explaining consumers' progress through life insurance decision states: The role of personal values and consumer characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Many people have unsuitable life insurance cover or no cover at all. In this study, we survey consumers about their readiness to purchase life insurance. Consumers rate their own "decision state" from "pre-aware" of life insurance to "aware," "interested" or "capable" of deciding to purchase. We also collect data on factors associated with progress along the path to purchase. We find that personal values partly determine life insurance decision states. Values matter in addition to the needs of dependents, bequest intentions, and financial literacy. Consumers who place more value on benevolence and self-direction are more likely to be aware of life insurance. Our results suggest strategies to promote suitable life insurance cover by targeting factors that help progress through each decision state. Insurance providers could thus prime benevolence and self-direction in advertising and product information.

TI  - Financial knowledge and 401(k) investment performance: a case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - We explore whether investors who are more financially knowledgeable earn more on their retirement plan investments compared with their less sophisticated counterparts, using a unique new dataset linking administrative data on investment performance and financial knowledge. Results show that the most financially knowledgeable investors: (a) held 18% points more stock than their least knowledgeable counterparts; (b) could anticipate earning 8 basis points per month more in excess returns; (c) had 40% higher portfolio volatility; and (d) held portfolios with about 38% less idiosyncratic risk, as compared with their least savvy counterparts. Our results are qualitatively similar after controlling on observables as well as modeling sample selection. We also examine portfolio changes to assess the potential impact of the financial literacy intervention. Controlling on other factors, those who elected to take the financial literacy survey boosted their equity allocations by 66 basis points and their monthly expected excess returns rose by 2.3 basis points; no significant difference in volatility or non-systematic risk was detected before versus after the survey. While these findings relate to only one firm, we anticipate that they may spur other efforts to enhance financial knowledge in the workplace.

TI  - Unleashing the mechanism between small and medium enterprises, and green financing in China: a pathway toward environmental sustainability and green economic recovery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - In this research, we analyzed green finance, small and medium-sized businesses, and financial literacy in China to boost the green economy. Green finance and financial literacy were examined holistically using a rigorous empirical approach and data envelopment analysis to provide the way to advance green economic recovery in this research. According to empirical evidence, green financing impacts SMEs at 0.31, 0.41, and 2.02 on green economic recovery. China's green finance and small businesses contribute significantly to the country's overall green economic revival. A more accurate forecast of green economic recovery was made possible by including other variables such as population expansion, development, and small business development. The analysis used the data envelopment analysis, and the results were solid. Additional hypothetical time-dependent instances demonstrated China's predicted green financing and small business's nexus for 2000 to 2020. The proportion of SMEs is decreasing, and as a result, green financing and financial literacy have increased by an average of 12.5% during this time. China's green financing would fall dramatically if the country's industrial structure is reduced. According to our findings, financial literacy is positively correlated with green economic recovery, while illiteracy is negatively correlated with growth. Finally, the report provides some ideas for China's future green economic recovery.

TI  - Women's decision-making on additional unpaid work during the COVID-19 pandemic: assessing the role of finance
T2  - ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB  - This article investigates the determinants of women's additional unpaid work during the specific circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Apart from the influential factors usually investigated in the standard model of unpaid work, we contribute to recent research by including variables such as financial literacy and family financial fragility. Pandemic lockdown altered the normal functioning of families and created financial uncertainty. Thus, we hypothesised that women's financial literacy and family financial fragility influenced women's decision to take on less or more unpaid work and could alter the division of unpaid work between women and other family members. We employed real-time individual-level data from the survey that we conducted during the second lockdown restrictions in January and February 2021. Croatia is an interesting case to investigate unpaid work determinants because although it has joined the E.U. and accepted positive legal aspects of gender equality, conservative gender norms still dominate there. The results revealed that women's financial literacy negatively affects women's willingness to take on more unpaid work while the deteriorating family financial situation in the pandemic has a positive effect.

TI  - Fintech and Financial Health in Vietnam during the COVID-19 Pandemic: In-Depth Descriptive Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The growing popularity of smartphones and the proliferation of technology have accelerated the development of the digital payment industry. Fintech enables customers to access financial services more efficiently and faster than traditional business, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic due to health protocols, including restrictions on physical contact. This study investigates financial literacy, fintech adoption, and the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the financial health of consumers in Vietnam. The relatively higher level of the unbanked population in Vietnam and the lower level of adult financial literacy compared with the ASEAN region motivated this study. Based on judgment sampling, participants were approached using the mall intercept technique, and those familiar with fintech were selected for the research interview. Thirty participants were interviewed and were given a survey form to be filled online using their mobile phones. Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS software version 23. Perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, brand image, government support, user innovativeness, and attitude are found to be significantly correlated with fintech adoption in Vietnam, while financial literacy was found to be not significantly correlated with fintech adoption. Furthermore, further analysis using multiple linear regression revealed user innovativeness and attitude have a positive impact towards fintech adoption, and in contrast, financial literacy showed significant negative impact on fintech. This inverse relationship could indicate that in Vietnam, fintech may play a role of bringing financial inclusion where people with lower financial literacy are able to use technology for financial transactions, which was previously inaccessible to them. This could also mean that Vietnamese with higher financial literacy do not see fintech as an important tool for their financial transactions, as they may already have strong access to traditional financial facilities. This research contributes to knowledge in the field of Fintech adoption in Vietnam at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak. To foster greater financial inclusivity and access for the Vietnamese consumers, policy makers could promote the development of fintech business infrastructure and regulatory sandboxes to foster fintech startups.

TI  - The Influence of Social and Personal Factors in Individual Investment Decision Making
T2  - QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB  - Research regarding relationship between social factors and investment decisions is still very rarely done. This study aims to examine the moderating relationship of polygamy risk as a social factor in the relationship between the level of risk tolerance and financial literacy in women on investment decisions in financial products. The data was collected using a survey method with 329 women as participants and married samples was women who worked in private banks and microfinance institutions. The data was classified based on the respondents' risk tolerance, financial literacy, and risk perception of polygamy. MANOVA Techniques were used to test the research model. The test results found that the risk of polygamy moderates the relationship between women in high-risk tolerance conditions. It shows that within the high risk of polygamy conditions, women's preference for short-term financial investment products is higher than in low-level risk polygamy conditions. The group of women with expert financial knowledge and a higher risk tolerance who choose to invest in short-term financial products as The moderating variable of polygamy can be considered as a social risk that cannot be controlled and is affected by the main effects of financial literacy and risk tolerance, where women naturally behave as risk averse in order to maintain a stable life and prosperity. Short-term investments have low returns, but they can be sold at any time and turned into cash, making them the most liquid assets.

TI  - Financial life-skills training and labor market outcomes in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION
AB  - This study examines the relationship between a United States Agency for International Development financial life skills training program for poor and vulnerable youth in Indonesia on labor market outcomes two years following the training. Longitudinal results indicate that self-efficacy and financial behaviors improved from pre-training to two years after the training, and a logistic regression analysis finds significant correlations between self-efficacy and financial behaviors with finding new or better employment. Because financial literacy education can be associated with improved financial behaviors, and soft skills acquisition can be associated with improved self-efficacy, we conclude that the training program led indirectly to new or better employment outcomes for participants. Reinforcing this result, between 92 % and 97 % of the trained youth attributed the training program to their observed improvements in work performance and/or to new or better employment opportunities.

TI  - Asset-rich and cash-poor: which older adults value reverse mortgages?
T2  - AGEING & SOCIETY
AB  - Home equity represents a substantial share of retirement wealth for many older persons, particularly in Asia where national housing policies have encouraged home-ownership. This paper explored the potential for reverse mortgages to help 'asset-rich and cash-poor' older Singaporeans unlock their home equity while ageing in place. The empirical analysis was based on a nationally representative survey of home-owners age 50+ in the 2018 Singapore Life Panel (N = 6,258). Our analyses showed that the average older home-owner holds some 60 per cent of total net wealth in housing equity, suggestive of high demand potential for reverse mortgage products. Nevertheless, actual interest in such products was much below potential demand. Only one in four older home-owners indicated interest in commercial reverse mortgages if these were to become available; a larger majority had never heard of the financial product. Interest in reverse mortgages was positively associated with product awareness and self-rated product understanding. This implies that a critical step towards building consumer interest would be to enhance awareness of such products and simplify related contract terms. Having a mortgage, fewer children, financial literacy and preparedness for retirement were also positively associated with interest level. These results have implications for targeted interventions to enhance consumer awareness and spur interest in reverse mortgages, especially in ageing societies where older people have built up substantial equity through the housing market over time.

TI  - Consumer Misconceptions about Tax Laws: Results from a Survey in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER POLICY
AB  - A survey of 1,131 consumers in the United States identified substantial gaps in knowledge or literacy with respect to fundamental U.S. tax law concepts of withholding and tax liability, tax brackets, tax deductions versus credits, charitable contributions, income and exclusions (gifts), and payroll/self-employment tax. Rates of misunderstanding of each concept ranged from 30% to 79%. Regression analysis suggests tax literacy was higher among males and consumers who were older, more educated, and had higher household incomes. Self-reported tax knowledge was weakly correlated with objectively measured knowledge (r = .37,p < .001), suggesting respondents had limited ability to estimate their own literacy of tax concepts. Tax literacy was significantly, but relatively weakly correlated with a more general measure of financial literacy suggesting that tax literacy is a related, yet distinct component of a consumers' overall financial proficiency. These findings have important implications for consumer welfare via potential impacts on everyday consumer decisions and public discourse.

TI  - INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSEHOLDS' FINANCIAL AWARENESS: A HUNGARIAN EXAMPLE
T2  - ECONOMICS & SOCIOLOGY
AB  - Financial crises put stress on the society of the country of our investigation, whose financial vulnerability is raising from high indebtedness, a history of defaulted loans, and an insufficient level of financial literacy. In this context, financial awareness has been recognised as a means for decreasing households' exposure to financial difficulties, bridging crisis periods with the substantial precautionary holding of liquid assets, and improving their well-being over longer periods of time. Raising financial awareness is a crucial policy aim, and has been investigated in this study as well. A questionnaire survey was completed by Hungarian university students across different majors, to assess the financial literacy level of the responders from their own perspective. In addition to this, we have investigated their e-banking habits. According to our findings, different student groups (clusters) have been identified by means of Ward analysis (where the significance of clusters were tested by ANOVA). Our results confirm that across all clusters the university students place their trust in non-governmental organisations and central bank foundations rather than those of the financial institutions in evolving financial literacy. This outcome of our study may provide an argument for designing policy incentives for raising financial awareness in an institutionalised way, relying on the role of the privately funded NGOs and on the central bank.

TI  - Women entrepreneurs' success factors of Northern Indian community: a person-environment fit theory perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
AB  - Purpose Women entrepreneurs contribute significantly to Asian economies. However, women in this region face an alarming array of barriers to entrepreneurship. This research study aims to examine the factors, i.e. government support, family social support, financial literacy and managerial skills, in building the entrepreneurial capacity of women entrepreneurs under the lens of the person-environment (P-E) fit theory. Furthermore, the study also examines the moderating effect of socio-cultural barriers in the said relationships. Design/methodology/approach For the study, the data was collected from the owners of 311 women-owned manufacturing and services sector enterprises from the northern Indian community. Findings Findings suggest that all the factors significantly affect the entrepreneurial capacity of women entrepreneurs, and the barriers work as a moderator between the relationships. Originality/value Based on P-E fit theory, this unique research study proposes a model to test the role of factors such as government support, family social support, financial literacy and managerial skills in developing women entrepreneurs' entrepreneurial capacity along with examining the moderating role of socio-cultural factors contributing to the entrepreneurial capacity of women.

TI  - Financial capability and households' financial vulnerability: evidence for the Spanish case
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The present study examines the potential relationship between financial capability and household financial vulnerability for a sample of Spanish individuals. Design/methodology/approach The methodology combines a literature review deepening on the two concepts addressed in this paper - financial vulnerability and financial capability - and an empirical analysis. Based on a sample of 7,811 Spanish individuals taken from the Survey of Financial Competences, different probit regression models are used to test the relationship of key independent variables (namely, financial literacy, financial inclusion, and financial capability) with household financial vulnerability. Findings Empirical evidence points to the existence of a negative relationship between financial capability and household financial vulnerability. Besides, the variable on financial capability demonstrates, per se, a greater explanatory power than its two components (i.e. objective financial literacy and financial inclusion) separately, particularly in the case of financial literacy. Originality/value This paper contributes to the research on household finances along three main dimensions. Firstly, it enhances the research on financial capability by analysing how it relates to consumers' financial vulnerability; an association barely explored by the extant literature. Secondly, it gets closer to the multifaceted concept of financial vulnerability through a wide set of objective and subjective proxy variables. And thirdly, the empirical evidence found leads to proposing some recommendations aimed at improving households' financial capability.

TI  - An Investigation into the Determinants of Investment Awareness: Evidence from the Young Saudi Generation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Investment awareness enables people to make sound and effective decisions in their investment activities. It is evident that many individuals were unsuccessful in managing their investment efficiently. Thus, this study aims to be pioneering among its kind to explore and examine the determinants of investment awareness. To achieve this purpose, we develop a comprehensive quantitative model that investigates the impact of the most essential and suggested drivers of investment awareness (i.e., financial literacy, spending patterns, self-control, saving behavior, attitude toward risk, and family financial socialization). Using convenience sampling, an online questionnaire (using five-point Likert scales) was distributed to a sample of students representing the young generation aged between 18-35 years old from the School of Business and Applied College at King Faisal University. To ratify the validity and reliability of the questionnaire, a pilot test was carried out. For analyzing and interpreting that data, we utilized partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The reported results of 409 responses show that financial literacy, self-control, saving behavior, and family financial socialization have positive and significant influences on investment awareness. Conversely, spending patterns and attitude toward risk are found to be positively but insignificantly related to investment awareness. These results ratify the need to formulate and implement operative actions to decrease the issue of investment awareness. This study adds to the body of knowledge on the determinants of investment awareness, specifically among the young generation (university students). Furthermore, examining the level of investment awareness could offer vital implications to policymakers, educational institutions, and families on how to enhance the awareness of young investors and support them in making good investment decisions.

TI  - Demographic characteristics influencing financial wellbeing: a multigroup analysis
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The study attempts to understand the factors impacting the financial wellbeing of IT employees in India using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). It utilizes well-established survey instruments to assess the impact of financial literacy, financial behaviour and financial stress on financial wellbeing. The study also attempts to understand the role of demographic factors (age, gender, monthly income, job category and work experience) in determining financial wellbeing through multigroup analysis. Design/methodology/approach Structured equation modelling (SEM) is used to study the link between the determinants. The study also attempts to understand the role of demographic factors (age, gender, monthly income, job category and work experience) in determining financial wellbeing through multigroup analysis. Data used for the analysis covers 237 employees working in the IT sector. Findings While financial literacy and financial behaviour have a significant positive impact on financial wellbeing, financial stress has a significant negative impact. Financial behaviour and financial stress were found to have a mediating role in the relationship between financial literacy and financial wellbeing. The demographic variables significantly moderate the relationship between the factors leading to financial wellbeing. Originality/value The results show the need for financial wellbeing programs to focus on enhancing financial knowledge and improving financial planning. Further, it suggests offering customized financial wellbeing programs based on the employee's demographic characteristics rather than following a "one program, fits all" approach.

TI  - DOES TIME MATTER? IMPACT OF FINANCIAL DECISIONMAKING ABILITIES ON FINANCIAL CHOICES MEDIATED BY TIME PERSPECTIVE
T2  - SERBIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial decision -making ability and financial choices, and also to check the mediating role of time perspective in this relationship. Financial decision -making ability is composed of two factors: financial behavior (FB) and financial literacy (FL). Whereas, three financial choices are used, which are: investment, savings, and consumption. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), the sample of 380 participants was used to analyze the results. The findings indicate that both financial literacy and financial behavior significantly increase the investment and choices of individuals, while financial behavior also increase consumption. In addition, study found that different factors of time perspective also mediate the relationship between financial decision -making ability and financial choices. The paper concludes with significant policy implications.

TI  - Guessing, math, or something else? Lay people's processes for valuing annuities
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION MAKING
AB  - Researchers have long been trying to understand why individuals dislike annuities. Here, we investigate if the process individuals use to assess the financial value of annuities may lead them to inaccurately value annuities. In Study 1, participants were asked to assess the monthly payments associated with a specific annuity lump sum or the annuity lump sum associated with a specific monthly payment. They were then asked to describe how they arrived at their answers. We find that when making this assessment, 42% of participants report attempts at using math, with some even describing mathematical formulas. Most other participants reported guessing instead. Reporting attempts at math is more common among participants with higher financial literacy and numeracy. Reported attempts at math, financial literacy, and numeracy predict arriving at more realistic financial values for annuities, as well as incorporating assessments of life expectancy in the math. Based on this process knowledge, we then designed an experiment in Study 2 and tested the effect of presenting information about life expectancy, providing feedback about payouts or their combination. We find that we can thereby change the assessed financial value of annuities and increase participants' interest in annuities, especially among participants that reported attempts at using math. Understanding the processes individuals use to assess the value of annuities informs theory and practice.

TI  - The micro determinants of financial inclusion and financial resilience in Africa
T2  - AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT REVIEW-REVUE AFRICAINE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
AB  - This study analyzes the factors influencing financial inclusion and financial resilience in Africa. Using national surveys of 40 African countries and the doing business database, multiple models are performed to analyze financial inclusion drivers. The results show that individual characteristics, barriers to formal accounting, financial literacy and innovation condition the decision to have a traditional or mobile account. Informal savings are common among women, youth and in rural areas while formal savings predominate among men, the elderly and in urban areas. A high level of education and income leads people to migrate to formal savings. For business purposes, informal savings are preferred while for old age, individuals resort to formal savings because of interest rates. Social lifestyles make informal credit predominate in Africa. However, when people have employment, high income or education, they turn more to formal credit to preserve their reputation because of the respect and popularity they enjoy in their community. Marriage, financial literacy and innovation improve the resilience of individuals, while employment increases their vulnerability. Key policy recommendations are to improve the banking sector, institutions, innovations and income-generating activities to attract women and reduce the gender gap.

TI  - The Impact of Digital Financial Inclusion on Household Commercial Insurance for Sustainable Governance Mechanisms under Regional Group Differences
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study explores the nexus between digital financial inclusion and household participation in commercial insurance, utilizing data from the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index and the 2018 CFPS database. Using Probit and Logit models, our research uncovers significant regional and risk -preference variations, emphasizing the influence of governance mechanisms. The study underscores the pivotal role of digital participation in a sustainable governance mechanism in shaping financial behavior, as well as the importance of advocating for regulatory interventions, enhanced financial literacy, and infrastructure development to foster equitable insurance access. Moreover, positive determinants, such as education level and social insurance participation, are identified, while discretionary spending emerges as a barrier. This study advocates for expedited digital financial inclusion initiatives to increase financial literacy with strengthened regulatory oversight and governance mechanisms which would ensure sustainable regional development and insurance market resilience.

TI  - FINANCIAL ADVICE, LITERACY, INCLUSION AND RISK TOLERANCE: THE MODERATING EFFECT OF UNCERTAINTY AVOIDANCE
T2  - E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT
AB  - The aim of this paper is to investigate the determinants of financial advice with a special focus on the cultural role in the influence of risk tolerance on seeking advice for financial issues. Financial literacy is covered by financial attitude, behaviour and knowledge. Financial inclusion is the other factor considered in the conceptual framework, as an indicator which can enhance both financial behaviour and financial advice. The research is based on primary data collected in two European nations, manifesting differences in culture, which gives the possibility to test the uncertainty avoidance role in the above relationship. This particular focus is the novelty of this work, as it sheds light on the importance of culture while designing policies with the aim to enhance individuals' financial literacy and advice. The hypotheses are tested by using Partial Least SquareStructural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) method. It was found that financial behaviour improves as financial inclusion gets better, along with financial attitude and knowledge. Furthermore, financial advice is positively influenced by financial inclusion and risk tolerance and partly by financial literacy. Additionally, findings demonstrate that culture does matter in explaining differences between countries. Culture in this paper is represented by uncertainty avoidance, as one of the Hofstede's culture dimension. Individuals from countries that manifest a very high preference for avoiding uncertainty reflect a negative relationship between risk tolerance and financial advice. The paper offers useful insights for policymakers and industry leaders in understanding the most influential factors on financial advice. This enables them to scheme policies and services aimed at equipping citizens with knowledge and skills to make the best use of their financial resources.

TI  - Conceptualizing financial capability: evidence from Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS AND SYSTEMS
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to investigate how microfinance institutions' clients in Indonesia conceptualize financial capability. Previous investigations on the concept were mostly in the lenses of those in the developed economies.
   Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative method was used, in which focus group discussions (FGDs) and interviews were conducted with microfinance institutions' clients and management in four provinces in Indonesia: DKI Jakarta, DI Yogyakarta, West Nusa Tenggara and South Sulawesi.
   Findings - The results exhibit some similarities with those of previous studies that highlight the importance of financial management and financial planning for strategic purposes. However, financial literacies perceived as less important due to the lack of awareness of the concept and its benefits.
   Research limitations/implications - This research is only focused on certain groups of the population which implies its limited generalizability. One important implication is for policymakers and scholars to re-examine the value of financial literacy within the context of Indonesia. Although the interviews reveal skepticisms on the instrumental value of financial literacy, robust investigations are further needed.
   Originality/value - This study is the first that uses the participatory method to define financial capability as understood by microfinance institutions' clients in Indonesia.

TI  - Socio-economic empowerment in rural India: Do financial inclusion and literacy matters?
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - Financial literacy as a major catalyst in the area of inclusive growth has obtained utmost prevalence, based on which this study intended to analyze the role of financial literacy in ensuring financial inclusion which further enhances socio-economic empowerment in rural areas of Karnataka, India. In order to conduct the study 398 responses (i.e. 93% response rate) were collected through comprehensive questionnaire which was then analyzed using SPSS 26 and SPSS AMOS 23 software, as SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) was used to evaluate the proposed conceptual model, as well as two-way ANOVA to analyze the demographic effect on the components. The study outcome confirmed that financial inclusion is highly affected by the financial literacy of a rural community in a direct way; but when they can take effective financial decision and are responsible in financial behavior, they tend to show more financial inclusion which has contributed to their socio-economic empowerment. Realizing the dominant role of financial literacy one of the key policy implications of this article is that the Indian government may begin spending considerable amounts of money to promote financial literacy, which can significantly expand financial inclusion. Furthermore, measures might be taken to discover the gaps in digital financial transaction (online and mobile banking) where the Government of India should be aggressive in building the infrastructure for financial inclusion, which would aid in the socio-economic growth of the rural people.

TI  - Framing the Retirement Planning Behavior Model towards Sustainable Wellbeing among Youth: The Moderating Effect of Public Profiles
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study examines the effect of financial literacy, saving attitudes, social influence, and goal clarity on the retirement planning construct. In addition, it investigates how the public demographic profile moderates these relationships. The questionnaire approach was utilized to collect data by adopting and customizing the measurement scale from previous studies. A systematic random sampling approach was employed on 323 prospective respondents. The outcomes of this study illustrate that all relationships are significantly and positively associated with retirement planning using structural equation modeling (SEM). Furthermore, all moderator variables (gender, age, status, income, and education) moderated the relationships. The government should construct a holistic retirement planning model that is based on demographic characteristics.

TI  - Skills and household financial decision-making in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose This study examines whether financial literacy is a relevant factor that determines authority in household financial decision-making, an area that is often viewed as boring, difficult and full of uncertainties. Cognitive ability and personality traits are also included as additional explanatory variables. Design/methodology/approach The logistic regression technique was applied using a sample of more than 2,300 microfinance institutions' clients in three provinces in Indonesia. Findings This study finds that financial literacy correlates positively with authority in household financial decision-making only among men. This does not mean that financial literacy is irrelevant for women's agency, since the skill might be important for authorities in other decision-making areas, including those outside households. Meanwhile, the relationship between cognitive ability and household financial decision-making authority is more universal. Research limitations/implications This study does not collect information on the levels of financial literacy of other household members and does not capture respondents' perceptions of household financial decision-making. Social implications The overall low level of financial literacy calls for the need for more targeted efforts to address this issue by policymakers. Education policy should also be designed to improve cognitive ability, as this ability is important for human agency and well-being. Originality/value Household decision-making has received significant attention in the literature. Authority in household decision-making is important because it represents a person's agency and has a profound impact on well-being. To the best of author's knowledge, studies on the importance of skills in household financial decision-making are very limited.

TI  - Economic condition and financial cognition
T2  - JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE
AB  - Are low-income individuals trapped because they are unable to make good financial decisions? We use a randomized controlled survey experiment to examine how prompting individuals to think about their personal economic condition (priming) affects their scores on a financial literacy quiz. We find that the marginal effect of poverty on financial literacy scores is 3.7 times higher for primed (treated) respondents compared to nonprimed ones. Priming not only worsens the financial literacy scores of low-income individuals, but also improves the scores of high-income individuals. Anxiety and shame are key explanations for our baseline results. Our findings shed light on how economic condition affects financial cognition, especially with regard to cognitive impediments resulting from negative emotions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - What drives working adults to be better prepared for their retirements?
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose This study aims to understand the drivers that help working adults to be better prepared for retirement, by examining the relationship between financial literacy (FL), financial attitude (FA), financial well-being (FWB), financial behavior (FB) and retirement preparation (RP). RP includes multidimensional measures, which are retirement confidence, retirement planning, long-term financial planning and private retirement schemes (PRS) participation. Design/methodology/approach This was a quantitative study adopting non-probability sampling with self-administered questionnaire distributed to all working adults. Descriptive analysis was used to examine the 294 useable data, and the multiple logistic regression analysis was adopted for hypothesis testing. Findings The empirical results show that FB is positively associated with RP and then followed by FWB on retirement confidence. Although insignificant influence is found on FL and FA, better FL and FA will still improve individuals' RP. Research limitations/implications The study provides insights to working adults that practicing positive FB and good FWB will improve RP. Besides, for financial institutions, income level is the main determinant for consumers to participate in PRS; for policy makers, to incorporate financial attributes knowledge as part of the school curriculum since early school years. Originality/value This study is one of the few studies in Malaysia that explored FL, FA, FB and FWB on retirement planning, respectively.

TI  - Dataset on determinants of intention and investment behaviour amongst young Indonesian millennials
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - The dataset examines three factors (i.e. financial literacy, self-control, peer-influence) that influence investment behaviour amongst young Indonesian millennials. Using a non-probability sampling technique, a total of 265 young millennials attending Investment Gallery seminar and workshop events in Jakarta, Indonesia completed an investment behaviour survey. The reflective measurement was performed using the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) to the screened data from the survey (N=213). The measurement includes the evaluation of outer loading, internal reliability, and convergent reliability. The final equation model was evaluated and estimated using SmartPLS v.3.3.2 program. The dataset is beneficial for companies seeking for potential investors from young millennials. The dataset also provides valuable insights for the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) and universities, particularly the faculty of economy and business in preparing their students with the financial literacy and investment knowledge.

TI  - The impact of mortgage broker use on borrower confusion and preferences
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - We examine how mortgage brokers affect borrower confusion about key mortgage features and assess whether brokers mitigate confusion by educating borrowers. Drawing from two lab -in -the -field experiments, we first show a correlation between the attributes borrowers find most confusing and those they find least important. Second, we show that borrowers who secure loans directly from lenders demonstrate lower confusion levels compared to those using brokers, even after accounting for self-selection bias. Despite this, broker users exhibit higher decision satisfaction and confidence after taking a loan. Third, using responses from discrete choice experiments to implement a causal mediation analysis with a single IV, we evaluate the influence of broker use, financial literacy, and subjective confusion on borrowers' willingness to pay for specific mortgage attributes. Our findings reveal that broker users are willing to pay more for attributes that increase the value and duration of loans, increasing broker commissions.

TI  - Is Social Capital a Key Factor to enhance Firm's Performance via Manager's Intangible Capabilities?
T2  - IIM KOZHIKODE SOCIETY & MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study is to analyse the role of internal social capital and external social capital in determining the financial and non-financial performance of the firm and the effect of manager's intangible capabilities on internal social capital and external social capital of firm in the context of the manufacturing sector of India.
   Design/methodology/approach: The data for this study is collected from 417 managers of manufacturing firms through a structured questionnaire and is analysed through SPSS and AMOS by performing confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling.
   Findings: Findings reveal that a manager's business experience, financial literacy and intellectual capital significantly enhance the firm's internal and external social capital. Furthermore, it has been found that the internal social capital of the firm has the potential to enhance the performance of the firm in financial and non-financial terms. The external social capital also significantly derives from the firm's financial performance; however, it has not significantly impacted its non-financial performance in the current study.
   Research limitations/implications: These findings provide many implications in theoretical and practical terms because the literature regarding social capital and the linkage among social capital, intangible capabilities and firm performance will be enhanced. The strategymakers and policymakers can also benefit from this study's implications for making better strategies and policies regarding social capital and the firm's performance.
   Originality/value: Past studies, though, examined the influence of social capital on business performance. However, no prior research addresses the phenomenon through which social capital can determine business performance while undertaking the role of a manager's intangible capabilities in such a model. Therefore, the current study is the first to study the interrelationship among the manager's intangible capabilities, social capital, and firm performance.

TI  - Towards an understanding of consumers' FinTech adoption: the case of Open Banking
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose This study aims to identify key factors driving consumers' adoption of Open Banking. It extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by integrating perceived risk, initial trust and financial literacy into an overarching conceptual model. Design/methodology/approach Measurement items of the theoretical constructs included in the conceptual model were adapted from related literature and a set of hypotheses was developed. The hypotheses of the conceptual model were subsequently assessed with partial least squares structural equation modeling using a dataset of 456 Australian survey respondents. Findings The model has strong explanatory power with an R-2 of 69.5%. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and perceived risk are direct antecedents of consumers' usage intention of Open Banking. Social influence has a strong mediating effect on usage intention through performance expectancy. The effect of perceived risk is alleviated by effort expectancy and initial trust, while initial trust positively affects the effects of performance expectancy and effort expectancy on consumers' usage intention of Open Banking. Finally, financial literacy lowers initial trust towards Open Banking, possibly inducing consumer skepticism. Practical implications The results suggest that practitioners should focus on performance expectancy as a primary driver of Open Banking adoption, while understanding the role of other drivers, such as social influence and perceived risk in developing marketing strategies. Policy makers are recommended to adopt a governance approach to build initial trust amongst consumers. Originality/value This research contributes by providing an integrated and comprehensive model for explaining consumers' FinTech adoptions by extending the existing technology adoption model UTAUT to the Open Banking domain and integrating perceived risk, initial trust and financial literacy, thereby advancing and enriching the conceptual horizon of the extant literature.

TI  - Financial education via television comedy
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - We show that television may be able to deliver rudimentary financial literacy in a cost-effective manner. In a controlled experiment, Cambodian garment factory workers were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: no video (baseline), slideshow and comedy TV show. After the intervention, to examine whether individuals were able to internalize the information that was provided, participants were asked to answer a set of questions on financial knowledge and attitudes. Our results show that participants randomly assigned to the comedy show are significantly more likely to report that they are interested in obtaining more information on savings accounts and are also significantly more likely to open a savings account in the next 6 months. This method of delivery may prove effective particularly for the disadvantaged sections of the population in remote regions of Cambodia.

TI  - Impact of financial behaviour on financial well-being: evidence among young adults in Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - The high cost of living and prolonged lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic made the financial well-being of individuals vulnerable, especially young adults. This paper examines the impact of financial behaviour on financial well-being (FWB) among young Malaysians during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study collected variable data on financial literacy, financial behaviour, financial socialisation, self-control, financial technology and FWB. To collect a representative sample of Malaysian young adults, a multi-stage random sampling method was used, and 360 young adults aged 18-29 years old completed the questionnaires. Structural equation modelling was adopted to investigate the factors influencing young adults' FWB. The empirical findings revealed a significant mediating effect of financial behaviour in the relationships between financial literacy, financial socialisation, self-control, financial technology, and FWB. The research concluded that the mediation analysis yields a clear and firm conclusion that financial behaviour is important in empowering young adults' FWB. Thus, the present study adds value to the existing literature on the relationship between financial behaviour and FWB. Furthermore, the paper's findings will assist government agencies and non-governmental organisations in developing outreach programmes for young adults per the strategies outlined in the Twelfth Malaysia Plan and the aspirations pledged in the Malaysian Youth Policy 2015-2035.

TI  - Digital vs. in-person financial education: What works best for Generation Z?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Nowadays, financial literacy is one of the most important skills that can be acquired by a tech-savvy Generation Z student. In order to understand what format of financial education works best for Generation Z, we set up an experiment that involved implementing a financial education program called "Futuro Sicuro" with a sample of 650 High School students in Italy. The program allowed us to gather data from two treatments at the class level, namely 1) a traditional financial education simplified program with the presence of a financial advisor, and 2) a digital financial education program using web-based applications based on learning-by-playing concepts. The two treatments were associated with different costs but showed similar effects: three weeks after their conclusion, we find that both courses did increase actual financial knowledge and the results also aligned with participants' realistic assessments of their own financial skills. A follow-up study also reveals the persistence of these effects three months later for the traditional course. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bringing Voluntary Financial Education in Emerging Economy: Role of Financial Socialization During Elementary Years
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC EDUCATION RESEARCHER
AB  - The level of financial literacy tends to be low in children, while information and financial education for children are very limited, especially in developing countries without mandatory financial education in schools. This study examined the effects of a classroom financial education program on financial knowledge. We used "Financial Intelligence Curriculum" designed for elementary school students from grade 1-6, focusing on the need and want, priority needs, income, spending, saving, and sharing. Using experimental method with pre-post-test and control group design, we found that the treatment group who received financial education has improved financial knowledge relative to the control group. The study provides evidence that elementary school students are appropriate targets for financial education and that it is necessary to develop mechanisms for effective learning to improve financial capability at an early age.

TI  - Too Far Away to Care about? Predicting Psychological Preparedness for Retirement Financial Planning among Young Employed Adults
T2  - EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
AB  - Knowing which factors underlie beliefs concerning financial planning for retirement (FPR) among young adults is essential for designing interventions to support their actual FPR. Therefore, we examined predictors of FPR-related beliefs and current retirement savings in a sample of 502 employed Slovak adults aged 20 to 35 years. Actual savings and all dimensions of psychological preparedness for FPR were positively predicted by retirement financial literacy and self-rated financial literacy. Moreover, we found that perceived FPR emotional load decreases with education, and perceived FPR task complexity diminishes with age. Further, increasing income was predictive of a higher subjective FPR competence and a perception of FPR as less stressful. Finally, professional experience in the financial domain was linked to a higher self-assessed capability in terms of FPR, but also with a lower personal FPR engagement. Our findings stress the need for effective communication of information about FPR's relevance to young people.

TI  - What You Think You Know: The Effects of Prior Financial Education and Readability on Financial Disclosure Processing
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Disclosures in advertising and other forms of marketing communication have been examined as a means to help consumers understand complex financial information and make more informed decisions regarding financial products and services. The authors extend inquiry into this supposition by looking at the readability of disclosures in relation to consumer financial literacy. In an experiment, it was found that while highly readable disclosures facilitate more accurate information processing for those with prior financial education, such disclosures might actually inhibit accurate processing for those without prior financial education. This suggests that policy cannot rely on mandated disclosure in marketing communications alone. Rather, disclosures in financial product or services communication can only be effective if such disclosures are paired with other forms of education leading to greater financial literacy.

TI  - DO WOMEN BEHAVE FINANCIALLY WORSE THAN MEN? EVIDENCE FROM MARRIED AND COHABITING COUPLES
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Extensive empirical evidence shows that women perform worse in financial literacy tests, which implies that their financial behaviour may also be worse compared to men. However, the literature on the gender gap in financial behaviour is scanty and highly inconclusive. Using data from a survey of married and cohabiting couples living in Poland (N=1,000) and a multi-dimensional scale validated in terms of its psychometric properties, this article compares the financial behaviour of women and men. The applied tests did not show any significant gender differences in the overall financial behaviour index or in any of the subdomains of the behaviour distinguished in the applied scale. Using the social identity theory as a framework, we discuss possible explanations of these puzzling findings, which may imply that women are unnecessarily considered a disadvantaged group in terms of preparedness to participate in financial life, including the business sphere.
   Implications for Central European audience: Assuming that the gender differences in financial literacy and behaviour can be explained on the grounds of the social identity theory, Central and Eastern Europe may differ from Western Europe in terms of the gender gap. Socially-imposed gender roles were presumably shaped differently behind the Iron Curtain, which resulted in that the distinction between masculine and feminine roles got blurred under the Soviet regime. As a result, the absence of gender differences in financial behaviour is more likely to occur in Central and Eastern European countries. Financial education initiatives should take this circumstance into account.

Our results also reveal that the three ESG factors are not homogeneous and should be considered separately. Lower exposure to ESG factors during the crisis period suggests that ESG investing is a luxury good for most investors.

TI  - The influence of religious belief and psychological factors on borrowing behaviour among Malaysian public sector employees
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
AB  - Purpose This study investigates the borrowing behaviour of public sector employees in Malaysia by focusing on religious belief and psychological factors. The first objective of the study is to examine the differences in the borrowing behaviour according to demographic and socioeconomic factors of the civil servants. The second objective of the study is to investigate the influence of religious belief, excessive consumption, materialism and financial literacy towards two aspects of borrowing behaviour: personal loans and credit card usage. Design/methodology/approach Primary data was collected using a digital survey which was distributed using a convenience sampling approach to public sector employees working in Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A sample of 340 public sector employees was obtained for analysis. Findings The study found that civil servants of different education backgrounds and income levels tend to differ in their borrowing behaviour. Specifically, those with lower levels of education, or lower income levels, tend to have a higher tendency of borrowing through personal loans. Multiple regression analyses reveal that public sector employees with either higher religious belief or higher financial literacy have a lower tendency of borrowing either through credit cards or personal loans. However, those who spend excessively or those who have higher levels of materialism tend to display more aggressive borrowing behaviour in terms of credit card usage and personal loans. Originality/value The study contributes to the literature by exploring the role of religious belief on borrowing behaviour. In addition, the study contributes to the literature by examining a specific group in the Malaysian society, i.e. public sector employees, due to the perturbing state of indebtedness among civil servants in Malaysia.

TI  - Determinants of financial resilience: insights from an emerging economy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Financial Literacy Survey of 2018 response is used to study the impact of financial knowledge, financial inclusion, and socio-demographic characteristics on financial resilience. The measurement of financial resilience considers elements related to keeping control of money, taking care of expenditures, having a financial cushion, handling financial shortfall or stress, and having financial planning. Using a sample of 3395 individuals across Malaysia, we find that greater financial knowledge is associated with the probability of being financially resilient. Greater financial inclusion in terms of having more bank accounts and holding more financial products is linked to the probability of being financially resilient. We also find that financial resilience varies across certain socio-demographic characteristics. Implications of the findings are discussed.

T2  - EUROMED JOURNAL OF BUSINESS
AB  - PurposeThis study contributes to examining the factors that drive the adoption of cryptocurrencies for financial transactions in the tourism and hospitality industries. This is crucial to develop tourism and hospitality and stimulate financial inclusion in developing and developed countries.Design/methodology/approachThis research paper employs the SEM model and bootstrapping method on a sample of 417 French participants involved in tourism and hospitality industries to reveal the causal pathway between a set of independent factors and the willingness to adopt cryptocurrencies for financial transactions.FindingsThe empirical findings reveal that ease of use, perceived usefulness, social influence, and financial literacy increase the willingness to use cryptocurrencies. French hotels need to have a strategic orientation, to deal with customers, competitors and changing technological environment. The study also reveals that social influence and financial literacy reduce the level of perceived financial risk and thus, leads to increase the intention to adopt the new type of decentralized currencies.Originality/valueIn contrast to previous studies that focused on the volatility and risk of cryptocurrencies, this research employs a human-centric approach covering different factors that could lead to the adoption of the new type of currency for financial transactions in tourism and hospitality industries.

TI  - Psychodynamics of Investments: Study on 'Fear' and 'Love' Among Financially Literate Investors in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This study examines the emotional undercurrents of individual investors. Earlier finance theory was based on the assumption that investors would act rationally. According to the findings, it is the investors' collective expectations and anxieties that have an impact on their investment fortunes. This necessitates a high level of emotional stability on the side of the investors. Investors must have a firm foundation in financial literacy to have the requisite level of emotional stability. This study aims to add to existing theory and practice by analyzing whether investors who have received business-related education are less emotional than those who have not. For the survey inquiry of individual investors, 'fear' and 'love' are considered among the emotional undercurrents of individual investors. The research is based on a survey of 875 individual investors in India, 342 of whom had a business background and the others have none. It has been discovered that no investor, regardless of their level of business education, is emotion-free. Investors with and without a business education display emotional stability in many behavioral aspects of fear and love to varying degrees.

TI  - Influential Behavioral Factors on Retirement Planning Behavior: The Case of Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - The main objective of this research is to identify the behavioral factors which have an effect on retirement planning behavior The study applies the theory of planned behavior and time perspective theory as a basis for the analysis of data by the structural equation modeling technique from a sample of 900 adults in Kelang Valley, Malaysia. The results of structural equation modeling show that financial literacy, propensity to plan, and future orientation are directly associated with retirement planning behavior The saving attitude is also found to partially mediate these relationships. However, family education and materialism are not associated with retirement planning. Implications for researchers and practitioners are presented.

TI  - Who Lacks Pension Knowledge, Why and Does it Matter? Evidence From Swedish Retirement Savers
T2  - PUBLIC FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Recent pension reforms have shifted a larger responsibility towards savers. Individuals therefore need better knowledge of the rules and incentives embedded in the pension system to adequately save and prepare for retirement. In this paper, we use a novel Swedish survey matched with high-quality administrative data to show that many lack, and feel that they lack, such pension-specific knowledge. We also show that the most economically vulnerable groups know the least. Linking pension knowledge to behavior, we find that knowing less is associated with lower preparedness for retirement, even after controlling for financial literacy and subjective knowledge. Moreover, a large majority state the complexity of the pension system, or that they have planned to learn more about pensions but that it just hasn't happened, as reasons for why they do not have sufficient knowledge.

TI  - Analysing the behavioural, psychological, and demographic determinants of financial decision making of household investors
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Adding to the behavioural science domain, the principal idea behind the study is to investigate the impact of an array of behavioural, psychological, and demographic factors on financial de-cision making. The study utilizes a structured questionnaire to collect the opinions of 634 in-vestors using a blend of random and snowball sampling techniques. The partial least squares structural equation modelling has been used to test hypotheses. PLS Predict has been applied to estimate the out-of-sample predictive power of the proposed model. Finally, the multi-group analysis has been applied to assess the differences across gender. Our findings attest the rele-vance of digital financial literacy, financial capability, financial autonomy, and impulsivity on financial decision making. Additionally, financial capability partially mediates the nexus between digital financial literacy and financial decision making. Also, Impulsivity negatively moderates the relationship between financial capability and financial decision making. The overall results of this comprehensive and unique study portray the influence that various psychological, behav-ioural, and demographic factors have on financial decision making, favouring the design of a feasible and lucrative financial portfolio to ensure financial well-being of households in the long run.

TI  - THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION IN ADOLESCENT CONSUMERS' FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE ENHANCEMENT
T2  - MARKET-TRZISTE
AB  - Purpose - The aim of this paper was to challenge the purpose of financial education in the context of financial literacy of adolescents, and to test the efficiency of the developed high-school study book and program "My money, my future". Also, the purpose was to identify the predictors of financial knowledge before conducting the workshop, as well as the characteristics of adolescents with best performances on the financial knowledge test.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - The data was collected from a purposive sample of teenagers who participated in "My money, my future" program from October 2016 to February 2018 and the questionnaire employed was a three-part tool.
   Findings and implications - Financial interventions contribute to young people's financial knowledge. Interest, previous financial education and ownership of a bank account were found to be valid and reliable predictors of higher levels of knowledge among teenagers. Furthermore, most high school students in the sample reported they had already engaged in saving behaviour, and more than half of them claimed to have bank accounts. Financial knowledge after the workshop was significant compared to their knowledge before the workshop. Greater knowledge before the workshop led to significantly higher levels of knowledge afterwards. Differences in the levels of financial knowledge were also tested with respect to gender.
   Limitations - The sample only includes high- school students and the research was conducted exclusively on the territory of the Republic of Croatia.
   Originality - The paper emphasized the importance of financial education programs in increasing the level of financial literacy and efficiency of future financial decision making among adolescents.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY: THE IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF THE SMEs IN KUCHING
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - This study aims at investigating the financial knowledge, financial behaviour and the attitude towards finance amongst on small medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) in Kuching. More specifically on how these powerful factors affect the profitability on fast growing business enterprises in largest city in the Borneo Island over the last decade. The research takes a descriptive approach fitting its underlying pursue and draws interesting conclusions with over 75% response rate. Analysis of the data collected clearly reveals that the knowledge of finance in general relates significantly stronger to the bottom line of these business entities relative to the owners' financial attitude and their ensuing behaviour towards financial decision making. Therefore, small medium entrepreneurs are highly recommended to participate in financial education on a regular basis to keep them well informed and equipped with the latest ways of managing the finances of their businesses to ensure better financial planning, execution and monitoring of enterprises that inevitably will lead to increased and sustainable earnings.

TI  - Sharia Economy, Islamic Financial Performance and Factors That Influence It-Evidence from Indonesia
T2  - ECONOMIES
AB  - The contribution of SMEs to economic growth is supported by the development of the sharia economy by the government, making SMEs one of the main pillars in Indonesia's economic development. This study aimed to analyze the influence of the digital economy, financial literacy, human capital, the role of Islamic financial institutions, government support for strengthening the Islamic economy and the Islamic financial performance of SMEs in Makassar City, Indonesia. This study used a quantitative method with a survey approach. Data were obtained through questionnaires distributed to 350 respondents with a sampling method. The results of this study indicated that the strengthening of the sharia economy, the Islamic financial performance of SMEs, economic digitalization and financial literacy are determined by factors of human capital, the role of Islamic financial institutions and government support. Regarding human capital, the roles of Islamic financial institutions and government support affect the Islamic financial performance of SMEs with a coefficient of determination of 58.5%. Human capital, the role of Islamic financial institutions, government support and financial performance have a positive correlation with the strengthening of the sharia economy with a coefficient of determination of 71.6%. This study supports the improvement of government policies and the construction of financial facilities in improving the Islamic financial performance of SMEs and encourages the strengthening of the sharia economy in Makassar City, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The limitation of this research is that the research object was only carried out on SMEs in Makassar City; thus, similar research can be increased at the national level to describe the strengthening of the sharia economy and the improvement of the financial performance of SMEs as a whole in Indonesia.

TI  - Determinants of Financial Empowerment Among Women in Saudi Arabia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Increasing women's financial empowerment is important as they experience a lack of control over economic resources as compared to men. Although plenty of research evidence is available on the determinants of financial empowerment among women in developed countries, there is less known in the context of a traditionally male-dominated society like Saudi Arabia. The current study proposes a conceptual model that examines the role of financial literacy and financial socialization, in the development of financial self-efficacy, financial coping behaviors, and financial empowerment among Saudi women using social cognitive theory (SCT). Data are collected through a baseline survey from a sample of 1,368 women respondents who belong to the different segments of society ranging from female university students to women in the household to women working in different sectors in Saudi Arabia. We employed partial least squares (PLS) path modeling techniques using SmartPLS to test the hypotheses proposed in this study. The study found a significantly positive association between financial literacy, financial coping behavior, and financial well-being. Financial socialization is also significantly related to financial self-efficacy and financial empowerment. We also found the positive role of financial self-efficacy and financial coping behaviors in the development of financial empowerment. The practical implication of this study includes the provision of financial literacy education/training to Saudi women and increasing their financial socialization to improve their financial well-being.

TI  - Financial Disclosure and Market Transparency with Costly Information Processing
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCE
AB  - We study a model where some investors ("hedgers") are bad at information processing, while others ("speculators") have superior information-processing ability and trade purely to exploit it. The disclosure of financial information induces a trade externality: if speculators refrain from trading, hedgers do the same, depressing the asset price. Market transparency reinforces this mechanism, by making speculators' trades more visible to hedgers. Hence, issuers will oppose both the disclosure of fundamentals and trading transparency. Issuers may either under-or over-provide information compared to the socially efficient level if speculators have more bargaining power than hedgers, while they never under-provide it otherwise. When hedgers have low financial literacy, forbidding their access to the market may be socially efficient.

TI  - Subjective financial knowledge, prudent behaviour and income The predictors of financial well-being in Estonia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study how subjective and objective knowledge of finance, behaviour in managing personal finances and socio-economic status affect financial well-being.
   Design/methodology/approach - The financial well-being score is constructed in quantitative financial literacy survey data from Estonia as the arithmetic mean of four statements on a five-point scale. Four hypotheses are tested in multiple regression analysis.
   Findings - Subjective knowledge has a stronger relation with financial well-being than objective knowledge. Financial behaviour score and income level correlate with financial well-being.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper contributes to literature on financial literacy, subjective financial knowledge and financial well-being. In future research, psychological factors and future orientated financial well-being should be included, and their relationship to subjective well-being could be analysed further.
   Practical implications - The results highlight the importance of subjective knowledge and sound behaviour for improving financial well-being. Providers of financial services should address these more in the design of their services and communication.
   Social implications - Policymakers developing national strategies for financial education need to address subjective financial knowledge for increasing financial well-being in society.
   Originality/value - Knowledge, behaviour and subjective knowledge have not been used simultaneously in the analysis of financial well-being in Europe before.

TI  - Young adults' default intention: influence of behavioral factors in determining housing and real estate loan repayment in India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOUSING MARKETS AND ANALYSIS
AB  - Purpose The primary purpose of this paper is to determine the role of behavioral characteristics of young adults on housing and real estate loan default intentions. The behavioral factors considered in this study are financial literacy, materialism, emotions, indebtedness and risk perception. Design/methodology/approach The sample frame comprises of young clients who have taken house loans and work in India's metropolitan cities. These cities provide a higher quality of life, more employment possibilities and cheaper living costs. A systematic questionnaire was used, which was divided into six components. A total of 352 valid responses were collected and analyzed through a structural equation model. Findings The findings suggest that financial literacy, materialism and risk perception have a considerable impact on loan default intention among young adults. The results also ascertained that emotion and indebtedness do not have a considerable impact on loan default intention among young adults. Research limitations/implications The scope of this study is limited to India's metropolitan cities. Future studies can examine comparative examinations of young adults working in the public and private sectors and those working in different cities across India. Practical implications This paper contributes to a better understanding of behavioral variables which may lead to the creation of preventive measures for young defaulters. The findings of this study will help financial institutions to improve their credit-offering models. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to determine the role of behavioral attributes of young adults on housing and real estate loan default intentions in India. This work will be executable to all the stakeholders of the housing and real estate industry altogether.

TI  - The role of financial risk-taking attitude in personal finances and consumer satisfaction: evidence from Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeFinancial risk-taking attitude (FRT) plays an important role in consumers' financial decisions, thereby determining consumer well-being. Motivated by the recent research on consumer well-being, this paper explores the relationships between financial literacy, a propensity to plan (PTP), FRT, financial satisfaction and life satisfaction.Design/methodology/approachThe authors use the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey to achieve the purpose of this paper. Furthermore, the authors use the variance-based partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), also known as the PLS path modeling approach to test our proposed hypotheses empirically.FindingsThe study finds a strong partial mediation of FRT between financial literacy and financial satisfaction. Moreover, the analyses reveal that a high PTP combined with a high FRT results in achieving high financial satisfaction, which leads to improved life satisfaction.Practical implicationsThe findings show the importance of creating financial plans in accordance with risk tolerance. While increasing financial literacy is relevant, the research suggests that tools that help consumers plan and invest in appropriate risky investments will lead to better outcomes.Originality/valueThough scholarly acumen of consumer well-being is rapidly developing, little remains known regarding the collective roles of financial literacy, PTP and FRT. The study addresses this gap by showing that financial literacy, risk-taking attitudes and planning propensities are all interconnected and necessary ingredients to improve financial and life satisfaction.

TI  - Consumer debt attitudes: The role of gender, debt knowledge and skills
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - The link between financial attitudes and consumer financial market behaviour is well documented. However, little is known about the role of financial knowledge and skills-the main components of the financial literacy construct-in shaping debt attitudes. This link is especially absent from the gender perspective. This study focuses on consumer debt literacy and debt attitudes. A representative sample of adult Poles (N = 1,004) was participated in a computer-assisted telephone interview. Latent class analysis was employed to reveal their debt attitudes, and subsequently, links between debt literacy and debt attitudes were studied with multinomial regression models. The results show that respondents in Poland can be grouped into five classes exhibiting different attitude profiles. The structure of debt attitudes is complex and differs from a simple unidimensional pro-debt/ anti-debt construct. Although this study did not find significant gender differences either in the conceptualization of debt attitudes or in their drivers, the results showed that in all but one class, consumer attitudes are strongly linked to either debt knowledge or debt skills or to both. Debt skills were revealed to be a particularly strong predictor of consumer debt attitudes.

TI  - Insurance Literacy: Significance of Its Dimensions for Insurance Inclusion in Uganda
T2  - ECONOMIES
AB  - The aim of the study was to establish the significance of the individual components of insurance literacy-knowledge, skills, attitude and behaviour-in explaining insurance inclusion in Uganda. The study was correlational and cross-sectional by design. Hence, 400 responses were obtained from individuals who enrolled for insurance. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was adopted to test the predictive power of the dimensions of insurance literacy on insurance inclusion in Uganda. Before performing correlational and regression analyses, the study variables were tested for parametric assumptions, convergent and discriminant validity, common method variance and exploratory factors. The results of the study revealed that knowledge, skills and attitude significantly and positively predicted insurance inclusion in Uganda. Contrary to prior studies, behaviour was found to have an insignificant positive influence on insurance inclusion in Uganda. Overall, the individual components of insurance literacy explained 38.5% of the variation in insurance inclusion in Uganda. Notably, the current study contributes to the nascent literature on insurance literacy and insurance inclusion. Earlier studies have ignored the insurance component of financial inclusion. The originality of this study lies in that it is the first to examine the significance of the individual dimensions of insurance literacy towards explaining insurance inclusion. The implication of this study is that policymakers should consider insurance literacy in national financial inclusion strategies and financial literacy programmes in order to foster insurance inclusion.

TI  - Do socio traits and behaviour cause attitude towards investment? Empirical evidence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIAL EDUCATION
AB  - The present study aims to investigate the probable impact of socio traits and behavior on the attitude towards investment among rural population. The responses of 400 respondents were collected and examined. Behavioural aspects were examined through behavioural proxies namely financial self-efficacy, personality traits, financial literacy, social influence. Age, gender, income, qualification, and marital status were investigated to measure the impact of demographics on investment attitude. Multiple regression, ANOVA, and Post hoc statistical techniques were applied to measure the impact. The results show that under study variables have significant effect on the investment attitude of the rural people. The findings also demonstrate that age and marital status have significant influence on the attitude towards investment and no other demographic variables show their influence on the investment attitude of rural people.

TI  - Persistence is Futile: Chasing of Past Performance in Repeated Investment Choices
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-APPLIED
AB  - When deciding where to invest, individuals choose mutual funds based on recent past performance, despite standard mandated disclaimers that "past performance does not guarantee future results." Investors would receive better long-term returns by choosing funds with lower fees. We explored the impact of fees and past performance on realistic mutual fund selections across three preregistered repeated-choice experiments (N = 1,600), while manipulating the presence of disclaimers between participants. Participants persistently chased past performance despite the opportunity to learn about the futility of this strategy during 60 repeated decisions with feedback. The standard regulatory-mandated disclaimer did not help most participants, compared to giving no advice at all, and was even counter-productive for participants with low levels of financial literacy. An alternative disclaimer that explicitly highlighted the advantages of fee minimization reliably helped participants. We show how individuals who lack both financial literacy and prior investment experience are the most susceptible to making poor mutual fund choices and can benefit the most from behavioral interventions such as the new disclaimer tested here. We discuss how these results generalize into real-world investment decisions, and how to design more efficient disclaimers that can be used beyond investment choices.
   Public Significance Statement Even when presented with the standard mandated disclaimer that "past performance does not guarantee future results," individuals tend to choose investments based on recent past performance. This research shows how a new disclaimer is better at changing behavior so that investors disregard past performance and choose funds with low fees instead, which do tend to provide better returns on average.

TI  - SHOPLIFTERS OF THE WORLD UNITE! LAW AND CULTURE IN FINANCIALIZED TIMES
T2  - CULTURAL STUDIES
AB  - The last two decades have seen significant growth and change in the character of the interactions between working-class households and financial markets. Individuals and households are bearing more and more of the risks that were once managed by governments and employers, and financial markets have developed a vast range of products to facilitate that risk transfer. This has put households at the centre of financial innovation, requiring the extension of regulation and consumer protection into a whole new suite of financial products and a project of financial literacy and advice. Along with this financial development and its associated regulatory demands has come a new cultural project of capital seeking to normalize the expanded integration of individuals and households into capital's frontiers of accumulation. The project invites and invokes new forms of subjectivity ( and subjugation) on the part of households. The developmental project required of state regulatory regimes is increasingly articulating not just a discourse of financial literacy but subordination to the individualism and discipline implicit in financial calculation. Contrary to its conception as spontaneous and individualist, this is an intentional and universalizing project of producing and managing labour's financial risks. In the collective self-management of these risks, the household is now not just a site of risk absorption; it is a major source of investment products ( and, therefore, at the frontier of accumulation). Increasingly also, in the name of financial stability, households - not just those reliant on state support - are becoming subjects of surveillance and administration in their internal financial functioning. It is these dual aspects of households as both consumers and producers of financial claims that give materiality to conceptual and historical claims about the financialization of everyday life.

TI  - Psychological determinants of retirement financial planning behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Various studies raise concerns over the pervasive poverty among women after retirement. Although much research is available on retirement planning, the advent of behavioral finance and the integration of psychological concepts with financial planning and saving behavior have made the phenomenon more critical. This study focuses on how the interaction between financial literacy as a cognitive characteristic and retirement goal clarity, future time perspective, attitude toward retirement, risk tolerance, and social group support as psychological characteristics influence women's retirement planning behavior. We use partial least squares regression through PLS-3 with Multi Group Analysis to test a set of theory-based hypotheses. Our results reveal a positive association of future time perspective, retirement goal clarity, and social group support with retirement planning behavior, which are moderated by financial literacy. Future time perspective and retirement goal clarity also play mediating roles. Our study has implications for financial planning professionals, advisors, and consumers.

TI  - Loan repayment performance of micro and small-scale enterprise: evidence from North Wollo Zone, Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Loan defaulting is a prominent challenge to financial institutions' outreach and sustainability. As it has been increasing and become a critical problem in the study area, this study aimed to analyze the loan repayment performance of Micro and Small-scale Enterprise (MSEs) in North Wollo Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. The study used a multi-stage sampling technique to select 336 sample enterprises (181 non-defaulter and 155 de-faulters). Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from primary and secondary data sources. The descriptive statistics result showed that non-defaulting was higher in trade (29.28%) and manufacturing (21.55%) MSEs, while high defaulting pertains to MSEs engaged in agriculture (24.52%) and construction (21.93%) sectors, respectively. The findings of financial ratios revealed that the average current ratio, debt ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio were 0.65, 0.72 and 7.95, respectively. The logit regression result showed that enterprise manager education level, collateral security, and financial literacy positively and significantly affected loan repayment performance while distance to lending institutions, repayment period, and loan diversion negatively affected it. Therefore, this study recommends that lending institutions and other concerned organizations organize warranties for the loan, align repayment schedules with the production period of enterprises, inclusive monitoring and supervision, and provide financial and basic business training to enterprises.

TI  - Determinants of Investment Behavior in Mutual Funds: Evidence From Pakistan
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This paper aimed to provide empirical evidence on the behavior of the investor toward mutual funds by considering its relationship with risk perception (RP), return perception (Return P), investment criteria (IC), mutual fund awareness (MFA), and financial literacy (FL). Data were collected using a questionnaire from 500 mutual fund investors, from which 460 questionnaires were used for the analysis. In addition, the snowball sampling technique was used to collect data from different cities in Pakistan. The result showed that RP, Return P, and MFA are insignificant and negatively affect the behavior of mutual fund investors. Investment criteria have a negative and significant effect on the behavior of mutual fund investors. Financial literacy has a positive and insignificant effect on the behavior of mutual fund investors. The results provide better information and guidance to investors and policymakers on the factors that affect the behavior of mutual fund investors.

TI  - Research on the Path of Financial Quotient Education in China's Application-oriented Undergraduate Colleges and Universities
T2  - EDUCATIONAL SCIENCES-THEORY & PRACTICE
AB  - Compared with the developed countries such as Britain and America, China's financial and business education started later without enough attention, especially in the economically backward central and western regions. With the further deepening of China's reform and opening-up and economic development, the backward finance and business education and the unbalanced regional development are not in line with China's economic and social development. Therefore, strengthening the financial and business education and further developing the human capital are the urgent tasks of China's education reform and development, and the universal financial education has been raised to the national strategic level. With the application-oriented colleges and universities in the central region as the object of research, this paper uses the method of questionnaire to explore ways to improve the financial literacy of college students.

TI  - Role of financial and digital literacy in determining digital transaction behaviour: evidence from student level survey in West Bengal (India)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Enormous development in information and communication technology (ICT) has brought about paradigm shift in human lives, society and economy as a whole. ICT can truly be considered as a general-purpose technology because of its presence in almost every domain of human lives and for enabling the digital economy (DE) to foster. However, participation in this DE is often dependent upon the financial literacy (FL) and digital literacy (DL) levels of the individuals. In this context, the present study seeks to evaluate the role of both FL and DL in determining participation in DE vis-a-vis digital transaction behaviour (DTB) amongst the post graduate students of the University of Burdwan. Analysis of the primary data with appropriate statistical methods suggested low to medium level of DL and FL amongst the respondents. The findings of the study unequivocally signalled that both FL and DL were instrumental in stimulating DTB of the respondents.

TI  - Keeping it in the family: financial constraints and the succession intention of micro and small enterprises in China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - Despite the significance of business succession in the family firm literature, few studies have paid attention to the role of financial constraints, a common feature of micro and small firms, in entrepreneurs' succession intention. Using a nationally representative survey of micro and small firms in China, we find that a higher degree of financial constraints significantly strengthens the entrepreneur's intention of passing the firm on to the next generation. Moreover, the effect of financial constraints works particularly for firms whose entrepreneurs possess lower levels of financial literacy and for firms in regions with less-developed financial markets. Our results still hold after addressing potential endogeneity problems and conducting a wide array of robustness checks.

TI  - Cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in online shopping
T2  - DIGITAL POLICY REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE
AB  - PurposeCryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly attractive as alternatives to traditional currencies. Although many retailers accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in online shopping, consumers' cryptocurrency adoption intention in online shopping (CCAI) is still low. This study aims to investigate the influence of attitudes, subjective norms, consumer trust, financial literacy and fear of missing out (FOMO) on CCAI.Design/methodology/approachA quantitative research approach was followed using a consumer survey. Hypothesized relationships were tested through regression and mediation analyses.FindingsThe results revealed that consumers could accept cryptocurrencies as a means of payment in online shopping. Attitudes, subjective norms, consumer trust and financial literacy directly and positively influence CCAI, while they indirectly affect CCAI through the mediating impact of FOMO.Practical implicationsMarketing managers should improve consumers' knowledge about cryptocurrencies and trust in online shopping to increase CCAI. Social media marketing can be appropriate, while the advertising content can address keeping up with others and staying connected.Originality/valueThis study addresses a critical gap in the literature by empirically examining the antecedents of CCAI within an original conceptual model based on the theoretical framework provided by the theory of planned behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, trust and financial literacy influence CCAI, where FOMO plays a significant role as a mediator.

TI  - Relationship between risk aversion, risky investment intention, investment choices Impact of personality traits and emotion
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to examine the effects of subjective and financial literacy, big five personality traits and emotions (fear, anger, hope and sadness) on risk aversion, risky investment intention and investment choices were investigated. Interactions of these three variables (risk aversion, risky investment intention and investment choices) were also examined.
   Design/methodology/approach
   For this purpose, in January-February 2019, collected data on 446 subjects from Turkey using the internet (341) and face-to-face (105) survey instruments. The authors exploited IBM SPSS Statistics for analysis. ANOVA, t-test and discriminant analysis were performed.
   Findings
   As a result of the analyzes, two personality traits (neuroticism and openness) and two emotions (fear and sadness) were determined as predictors of risk aversion. For risky investment intention, risk aversion, two personality traits (neuroticism and openness) and one of the same and other one different two emotions (fear and anger) were found.
   Originality/value
   Investment choices can be estimated by objective financial literature, risk aversion and risky investment intention. In addition, individuals' risk averse or risk taking characteristics differ according to their level of sadness with agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism personality traits. Similarly, have a risky investment intention or have not risky investment intention also differs according to sadness emotions with conscientiousness and openness. Finally, the choice of stocks or bank deposits varies according to subjective financial literacy and extraversion personality trait.

TI  - Antecedents and Consequences of Using Social Media for Personal Finance
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This study was intended to find out whether social media could be a solution to improve personal financial literacy and ability. The authors examined the antecedents and consequences of using social media for personal finance with survey data from 359 individuals who used social media tools to view, learn, post, or ask for financial information or advice. They found that usefulness and compatibility were two reasons why people use social media for personal finance, while ease of use and concerns/risks were not. The study also revealed that social media use for personal finance were associated with positive financial outcomes and user satisfaction, which in turn prompted users' intentions to continue using social media for personal finance in the future. These findings suggested that social media could be a legitimate and fruitful source for individuals and financial industry to improve personal financial well-being.

TI  - Is technology truly improving the customer experience? Analysing the intention to use open banking in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeOpen banking, with its promise to revolutionise electronic transactions through open application programming interfaces (APIs), aims to bridge the gap between banks and non-banks, enhancing lending, payments, investments and funds distribution. However, does this bold innovation truly resonate with consumers? This study delves into consumer intentions to adopt open banking in Indonesia by leveraging the technology readiness model, scrutinising its antecedents and moderating factors, and identifying the key attributes that users anticipate.Design/methodology/approachThrough quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study answers the following questions: (1) Are financial service users ready to use open banking/open API applications? (2) What are the key attributes that consumer expects of open banking/open API? First, the authors developed a structural model based on the technology readiness model, distributed the questionnaire in eight major cities in Indonesia, analysed it using PLS-SEM and utilised a machine learning approach to unpack the main attributes expected from open banking.FindingsThis study's findings indicate that customers are generally prepared to embrace open banking innovations. Nonetheless, to enhance public acceptance, certain factors should be emphasised, including organisational support, user-friendly technology, a comprehensive range of features, consumer financial literacy and banks' readiness to adopt open banking. In contrast to prior research, this study reveals that loyalty to traditional banking positively moderates the connection between customer value and the intention to utilise open banking. Additionally, the authors did not observe a significant moderating effect of financial literacy on the relationship between perceived customer value and the intention to use open banking.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the few that comprehensively analyses the consumers' readiness for open banking in developing contexts. This study is expected to produce a theoretical contribution as well as effective and optimal policies for the financial services sector.

TI  - Building financial resilience through financial and digital literacy in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - EMERGING MARKETS REVIEW
AB  - Globally, 1.7 billion adults still lack access to formal financial services, with a large percentage living in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Current financial inclusion strategies seek to enhance these vulnerable populations' access to financial services with the aim of building more inclusive and financially resilient societies. With the Fintech movement and over 67% of the world's population having a mobile phone, digital financial literacy is gaining momentum. Nevertheless, negligible research has measured its impacts on financial behavior. This study uses data from the InterMedia Financial Inclusion Insights (FII) surveys for seven South Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries to investigate the relationship between multidimensional measures of financial and digital literacy and resilience-building financial behaviors, including saving, borrowing, and risk management. The findings consistently show that both financial and digital literacy are key factors to building inclusiveness and financial resilience. Heterogeneities are identified across regions, as well as for poor, rural, and female households. A robustness check is also included to address potential endogeneity. The results emphasize the need to redefine traditional financial literacy to include digital literacy, with important implications for countries considering both as a dual approach to improving households' long-run financial resilience.

TI  - The direct and indirect effects of financial socialization and psychological characteristics on young professionals' personal financial management behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposePrior work expresses concern about young people's rising debt and lack of financial preparedness. This study focuses on how financial socialization and psychological characteristics affect the personal financial management behavior (PFMB) of young professionals in India. The authors examine both the direct effect of these factors and the indirect effects through financial literacy and aforementioned psychological characteristics as mediators.Design/methodology/approachThe authors develop a conceptual framework based on the extant literature and empirically test its hypotheses employing partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM).FindingsAttitude towards money, financial self-efficacy, financial risk tolerance, financial socialization through parental direct teaching and peers, and media are all positively associated with young professionals' PFMB, whereas external locus of control and procrastination are negatively associated with their PFMB. Almost all psychological characteristics partially mediate the association between financial socialization and PFMB. Finally, financial literacy plays a partially mediating role in the association between procrastination and PFMB as well as between financial socialization and PFMB.Practical implicationsThis study helps regulators and policymakers understand PFMB among young professionals. Interventions should build on the positive role of financial socialization, cultivating a good attitude towards money and financial self-efficacy, and reducing reliance on an external locus of control and procrastination. This study also helps policymakers and financial educators develop societally beneficial personal finance programs.Originality/valueThis research investigates social, psychological and cognitive characteristics in a comprehensive framework to further the authors' understanding of the topic of PFMB.

TI  - HOW FEMALE DIFFER IN DECISION MAKING FOR PERSONAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - This study investigates Lithuanian females' personal investment peculiarities in line with Australia's case analysis and application as a good practice method. Based on many publicly available research females tend to have less knowledge about finances in general and particularly investment processes; hence, it leads to their lack of interest into investing and the possibility of poor money management. This issue might be solved by investigating why it appears first and adopting the practical example from countries with developed investment market. In the case of comparison of personal investment strategies among Lithuanian and Australian females the two sets of questionnaires have been used to collect the data for further analysis. The main findings revealed by the survey were, that women in Australia had a higher financial literacy level, invested more often, and chose broader variety of investment instruments compared to Lithuanian females. Moreover, the significant discovery of the article disclosed that Lithuanian females chose not to invest due to the lack of additional funds and the shortage of financial knowledge. The main limitation occurred during the research was the lack of the available data on personal investment topic in Lithuania's official statistic sources such as The Lithuanian Department of Statistics. The results of the research contribute towards improving Lithuanian female personal finance and investment areas and could be applied to further studies or used for the education program dedicated to financial literacy among women in Lithuania creation. Furthermore, this article creates an original value to personal finance, investment, and financial literacy areas in Lithuania by introducing an idea to not only conduct more studies in these fields, but also to use comparative analysis and good practice method from the countries that demonstrates high achievements in personal finance and gender equality areas.

TI  - Consumers' knowledge of cashless payments: Development, validation, and usability of a measurement scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - The global digital shift, recently accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, requires that consumers have knowledge allowing them to navigate increasingly cashless markets safely and effectively. To enable valid and reliable measurement of such knowledge, we used data obtained from a random sample of adult Poles to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties and applicability of an original cashless payments knowledge scale (CPK scale). Our analyses based on Item Response Theory show that some evident subdomains exist within the CPK construct. The separate dimensions of the CPK merge into a coherent scale with solid psychometric properties. We find that the CPK score depends on the place of residence, education, and household size, and is positively related to safe cashless behavior. Our findings may have important implications for financial institutions as well as policymakers interested in segmenting consumers in terms of their financial knowledge, potential risks resulting from deficits in this knowledge, and enhancing financial literacy.

TI  - The relationship between migration background and knowledge and understanding of personal finance of young adults in Germany
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION
AB  - Financial knowledge and understanding is needed to function well in society; however, young people with a migration background in Germany have been found to perform worse on tests of financial knowledge than those without. Very little investigation has been made into the relationship between financial knowledge and language ability, and ostensibly no in-depth investigation has been made into the connection between frequency of use of the local language and how it correlates to performance on such tests. In this paper we examine the relationship between migration background and knowledge and understanding of personal finance of young adults in Germany. We administered a validated German version of the Council for Economic Education's Test of Financial Literacy to 1037 individuals between the ages of 17 and 25 and controlled not only for migration background but also for frequency of German language use. In line with results of previous studies, we found participants with a migration background generally had less financial knowledge than those with no migration background. More specifically, migrants who spoke predominantly a language other than German at home demonstrated less financial knowledge than those who spoke German at home with their families. Thus, it is not migration background per se, but rather more obscure variables related to migration background that may influence performance on such tests of financial knowledge.

TI  - Literacy and the quality of index insurance decisions
T2  - GENEVA RISK AND INSURANCE REVIEW
AB  - There is widespread concern in developing countries with the expansion of formal insurance products to help manage significant risks. These concerns arise primarily from a lack of understanding of insurance products, general failures of financial literacy and the need to use relatively exotic products in order to keep costs down for poor households. We investigate the importance of incentivized measures for general understanding, as well as domain-specific knowledge of the decision context on the purchase and the quality of index insurance decisions. We evaluate the quality of financial decisions by comparing the individual expected welfare outcomes of a number of decisions each individual makes to purchase index insurance or not. We find that excess purchase is an important driver of welfare losses, and that our incentivized measure of domain-specific literacy plays a critical role in bringing about better quality index insurance decisions.

TI  - Overconfidence, Financial Advice Seeking and Household Portfolio Under-Diversification
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between overconfidence and losses from under-diversification among Dutch investors. We find that a lack of proper portfolio diversification is positively associated with overconfidence. Part of this relationship is mediated through the lower propensity of overconfident individuals to hire a professional financial adviser. We use data from the 2005 wave of the DNB Dutch Household Survey that provides us with detailed portfolio data of 257 investors. We proxy for overconfidence by exploiting the difference between measured and self-assessed financial literacy, and use this proxy in a regression model (with and without mediation) to explain the difference between the actual households return and the return that could have been obtained by selecting a portfolio on the efficient frontier with equivalent risk. Our results contribute to the current discussion among policy makers on the role of financial advice and self-perceptions in household financial decision-making.

TI  - Comparison of financial education and knowledge in the United States and Germany: Curriculum and assessment
T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB  - Changes in the economy and society lead to a growing necessity of financial education. In this context, we investigate the approaches to financial education in secondary schools in the United States and Germany. We seek to answer the question if and how the implementation of financial education is similar and different between the two countries. We address this question for financial education by comparing the educational conditions, coursework structures, content standards, instructional resources, and assessment within each country. Additionally, we focus on differences in cognitive structure of financial knowledge and understanding among students within each country. For this exploratory analysis, we used data from the Test of Financial Literacy that was administered to students in the United States and Germany (n = 2326). The empirical results reveal differences in knowledge structures in specific content areas among students in the two countries. Possible reasons for such differences and other implications are discussed.

TI  - Trust and retirement preparedness: Evidence from Singapore
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ECONOMICS OF AGEING
AB  - Trust is an essential component of any financial system, and distrust can undermine savings and economic growth. Our study draws on the Singapore Life Panel to assess how trust ties to older respondents' (1) pension plan participation and withdrawals; (2) life, health, and long-term care insurance holdings; and (3) stock market engagement. We show that the widely-used 'trust in people' question is uncorrelated with household behaviours related to retirement preparedness. Instead, trust in private and public financial representatives is positively associated with pension savings, investments, and insurance holdings. Financial literacy also plays an important and consistent role in retirement decision-making.

TI  - Student loan debt: A problem-based learning activity for introductory economics students
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC EDUCATION
AB  - Student loan debt and delinquency is a mounting problem among college graduates. To show students the consequences of debt-financing their education in an economic context, the author describes a collaborative problem-based learning activity designed for small, introductory economics courses. The activity has three parts: an introduction to the current statistics and trends on student loan debt, a postmortem analysis of three fictitious borrowers, and a pre-mortem analysis of the student's education, career plan, and financial goals. The activity applies economic topics including pre- and postmortem analysis, financial literacy, and opportunity cost and tradeoffs. Pre- and post-activity survey results find evidence of students improving their knowledge of their own student loan debt situation, salary outlook, and the repayment plans available to them post-graduation.

TI  - Whose rationality? Muddling through the messy emotional reality of financial decision-making
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - The public's financial security is vital to economic stability, with policy and practice efforts focused on developing financial literacy to reduce financial vulnerability. However, this approach fails to fully consider the emotional factors that influence the financial decision-making process. This study examines how emotions shape these decisions, drawing on the concept of 'muddling through' to understand the complex process to be navigated. Data are drawn from 78 in-depth interviews with consumers who were financially 'struggling and squeezed'. 'Integral' and 'incidental' emotions were influential both in assisting the decision-making process and in introducing biases that could lead to harm. Consumers were able to rationalize their decisions, even though they might not be economically optimal in the longer term. Muddling through theory is extended by explaining the role of emotions within it. New insights into the interaction between emotions that are 'integral' or 'incidental' to decision-making lead to policy and practice recommendations.

TI  - Financial product sensitivity predicts financial health
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION MAKING
AB  - Recent research has aimed to understand how people consider financial decisions because they have important consequences for well-being. Yet existing research has largely failed to examine how attitudes and behaviors vary as a function of the specific financial product (e.g., debt type). We ask to what extent people differentiate between similarly categorized financial products (e.g., debt or investment) as a function of their terms (e.g., interest costs and expected returns) and whether such differentiation predicts financial health. Across four studies, we find not only that there are individual differences in attitudes toward similar financial products (e.g., two distinct loans), but also that the extent to which a consumer is averse to high-cost versus low-cost products predicts financial health. This relationship cannot be fully explained by financial literacy, numeracy, or intertemporal discounting. In addition, nudging people toward differentiating between financial products promotes decisions that are aligned with financial health.

TI  - Understanding financial professionals' perceptions of their clients' financial behaviors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThis article describes financial professionals' perceptions of their clients' financial behaviors and the explanatory factors underlying these behaviors.Design/methodology/approachIn this qualitative research, the authors seek to understand financial professionals' experiences in relation to how their clients manage their own finances. The authorse conduct and analyze 26 semi-structured interviews with financial professionals from several industries within the financial sector in Canada.FindingsThe professionals in this study noted that despite their clients' financial knowledge, several other factors can explain these individuals' financial behaviors. They include psychological factors, (such as financial bias, the need for instant gratification, and the lack of awareness regarding the long-term effects of certain types of financial behaviors), financial habits (such as lifestyle, financial planning and lack of discipline) and the financial system's flexibility with respect to debt financing and repayment. These perceptions are categorized according to whether they are related to debt financing or repayment, savings or investments.Originality/valueBy using a qualitative methodology that relies on the perceptions of financial professionals, this study aims to better understand the financial behaviors of individuals and households, and these behaviors' underlying factors. This study's findings could be useful to various stakeholders interested, in one way or another, in financial literacy, such as organizations aiming to strengthen and promote financial literacy, educators, researchers, regulatory bodies of financial institutions and financial advisers.

TI  - Easy, breezy, risky: Lay investors fail to diversify because correlated assets feel more fluent and less risky
T2  - ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES
AB  - Why do people fail to diversify risk in their investment portfolios? We study how lay investors (people with low financial literacy) invest in financial assets whose past or expected returns are provided. Although investing in assets with negatively correlated returns reduces portfolio risk (i.e., reduces portfolio fluctuations), we find that lay investors instead prefer investing in assets with positively correlated returns, which results in less diversified and riskier investment portfolios than intended. Using a mixed-method approach, we find that lay investors rely on a lay perception of portfolio risk: assets with positively correlated returns feel more fluent (more familiar, simple, and predictable), and thus are erroneously perceived as less risky. We find that lay investors succeed in forming diversified, lower-risk portfolios when they are provided with aggregate portfolio returns, or when-paradoxically-they are encouraged to take more risk.

TI  - Investor characteristics, intention toward socially responsible investment (SRI), and SRI behavior in Chinese stock market: The moderating role of risk propensity
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - In recent years, Socially Responsible Investment (SRI), which integrates financial returns with social impact, has gained prominence. Commonly referred to as ethical or green investing, this study employs the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to analyze factors that influence SRI behaviors. The TPB model suggests that behavior is primarily influenced by attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and intention. The study uniquely adapts the TPB model by incorporating financial literacy as a critical factor, a hypothesis substantiated through primary data from Chinese investors. Furthermore, the research highlights risk propensity as a moderating variable, significantly affecting these dynamics and offering essential insights into SRI practices. By utilizing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in conjunction with TPB, the study investigates the behavioral patterns of investors in Chinese stock market with a specific focus on the impacts of financial literacy, the moderating role of risk propensity, and the mediating effects of investment intentions on SRI behaviors. The findings reveal that PBC plays the most crucial role in shaping investors' intentions and behaviors toward SRI. Additionally, the results recommend that policymakers and SRI providers consider the social influences on investors' decisions and acknowledge the significant impact of investors' perceived control in forming their SRI intentions and actions.

TI  - Talking money at home: the value of family financial socialization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The objective of this study was to empirically examine how family financial socialization affects individuals' financial outcomes, including financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being, based on the family financial socialization theory (FFST). Design/methodology/approach Using a national representative sample of 6,311 US respondents from the 2016 National Financial Well-Being Survey, structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test the hypotheses in this study. Sampling weights were incorporated into the structural model using the maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors and a Satorra-Bentler scaled test statistic (MLM estimation). Findings This study concludes the effectiveness of family financial socialization by showing that parental financial socialization has significant positive impacts on financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being. In addition, parents' education can significantly influence the quality of parental financial socialization. Practical implications The result underscores the importance of financial socialization in the family context and encourages parents to discuss financial matters with their children at home. Detailed implications have been provided to financial educators, practitioners and policymakers to incorporate parental involvement in the design of financial education programs, as well as financial services providers to improve marketing strategies for their banking services. Originality/value This research is amongst the first to empirically explore the relationships among parental financial socialization, financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being based on the FFST. The study also contributes to the literature by confirming the effects of parental socialization received in childhood on adults' later financial outcomes.

TI  - Linkage between financial inclusion and Indonesian welfare: a recent evidence
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper provides the linkage between financial inclusion and welfare in Indonesia. This paper analyzes the level of financial inclusion Indonesian welfare using provincial data during 2015-2018. Index of Financial Inclusion (IFI) is calculated based on the dimensions of accessibility, availability, and usage of financial services. We employ the generalized least square (GLS) method for panel data estimation. Evidence showed that financial inclusion in Indonesia which mostly determined by the dimensions of the use and availability of financial services, while the accessibility dimension was relatively low in Indonesia. Based on the financial inclusion index, 25 provinces were grouped in the low financial inclusion, 8 provinces in the medium category and only DKI Jakarta Province categorized as high financial inclusion. The panel data estimation results show that the financial inclusion index has a positive and significant effect on the welfare of the Indonesian people as proxied by the human development index. The level of financial inclusion remains uneven between province in Indonesia. The lowest level of financial inclusion related to accessibility. The government should provide socialization and education of financial products to the public community, especially formal financial services such as banks. Financial literacy played an important role to improve welfare as a whole.

TI  - ESG in investor profiling: what are we talking about?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeInspired by the groundbreaking novel European regulations on financial investors' profiling (MiFID II regulation and the ESMA 2022 Guidelines), this paper aims to establish which distinctive socio-demographic traits distinguish investors who declare a generalized interest in all three environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) pillars and investors who express interest in just one individual pillar or a combination of two pillars.Design/methodology/approachBased on a unique dataset of 190 real-world retail investors, this paper aims to create a profile of three types of investor: those whose interest lies in just the environmental pillar, those interested in a combination of the environmental and social pillars, and those interested in all three E, S, and G pillars jointly. Moreover, we try to ascertain whether it is possible to observe statistically significant differences between the different types of investors.FindingsThe results obtained indicate that it is possible to profile investors who are environmentally-oriented and investors who are ESG-oriented. Notably, levels of financial literacy do not influence investor ESG attitudes.Practical implicationsThe results obtained may have multifaceted implications for financial advisors, the banking and financial institution industry, and marketing strategists, as well as for further research.Originality/valueThe originality of this paper derives from the responses used in the analysis, which were collected from a sample of real-world retail investors who completed a mandatory MiFID-questionnaire, validated by the Italian Securities and Markets Supervisory Authority. Our paper thus represents a bridge between a theoretical approach and real-world practice.

The empirical tests for the effect of financial education on financial literacy suggest that women who receive early financial education better understand the compounding effect of interest rates on loans, portfolio diversification, and mortgage payments. The impact of early financial education on financial behavior is also evident in women's increased participation in the stock market, insurance activities, and savings habits. The implications can be used to guide policymakers charged with promoting gender equity through early financial education.

TI  - Entrepreneurial Self-efficacy and Financial and Calculation Skills Can Shape Different Profiles of Venture Intentions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB  - The complexity of finances and access to financial markets is one of the main challenges facing an entrepreneur. However, not many studies examine the effect of financial skills on entrepreneurial intentions. Our research describes venture intentions, considering motivations, contextual factors and personal traits in different clusters, based on the strong sense of entrepreneurial self-efficacy and the levels of financial literacy and numeracy skills. Results demonstrate that financial and numeracy skills and self-efficacy shape different profiles of potential entrepreneurs. The study shows that social motivations exert a favourable impact on entrepreneurial intentions only for those who firmly believe in their abilities or have high financial and numeracy skills. For those without outstanding skills or high self-efficacy, contextual factors play a key role in the decision to launch a new venture.

Having accurate financial information increases ones competency to be financial literate. It is regarded as a common and basic life skill that libraries can develop for their users. Using purposive sampling, this study ponders into the status and challenges of eight public city libraries in the Philippines in terms of providing FL education and how they can potentially share a role in developing the economy of a country. Public libraries' readiness to serve their users can be observed in terms of their collection, web presence, services, and programs. The level of financial knowledge and competencies of city librarians were also assessed. A look into the available professional development programs for public librarians in business and finance librarianship was reviewed.

TI  - Do social networks affect household financial vulnerability? Evidence from China
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Using data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in 2018, we first examine the impact of social networks on household financial vulnerability and find that social networks significantly reduce the probability of household financial vulnerability. In particular, we find that there is a noticeably larger mitigating effect of social networks on household financial vulnerability among households with higher indebtedness. We also find that social networks can reduce household financial vulnerability, regardless of whether households have commercial insurance or not. Further, we investigate how social networks affect household financial vulnerability. Evidence suggests that social networks can mitigate household financial vulnerability by encouraging informal debt from family or friends and improving financial literacy. Our empirical results are still robust when we address the potential endogeneity problem arising from social networks.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - In order to survive in this complex economic business environment with fierce competition among various players of the finance sector, the need is to understand the even more complex financial behaviour of the customers. We apply the support vector machine classifier, a machine learning algorithm to construct a nonlinear model which classifies the customers into good and bad class based on their respective positive and negative saving behaviour. With the help of web-based survey, a sample of urban banking millennial was collected and preprocessed to apply the support vector machine classifier technique. Pattern recognition from data and its prediction for the financial behaviour are based on the machine learning forecasts. Moreover, the comparative analysis of the weightage of the three attributes, namely income level, financial literacy and behavioural characteristic, is carried out and it is analysed for the savings/wealth accumulation of the millennial generation to understand the financial distress among the said generation in context.

TI  - Developing financial competence about mortgage loans by informal learning using banks' online calculators
T2  - EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AB  - Background and aim: Financial literacy (or financial competence) has become an internationally relevant and highly regarded topic. Since people often lack sufficient financial competence, in many countries efforts have been made to foster formal financial education. Less attention, however, has been paid to whether informal learning using information available on the Internet can also support the development of financial competence. However, this seems to be an important question because the Internet has expanded the opportunities for informal learning. In addition, people need to acquire financial competence on their own because not every financial topic relevant in one's lifetime is covered in formal education syllabi. Against this background, in this study we tested whether people are able to develop financial competence by learning informally using information available on the Internet. We focused on mortgage loans, as they are comparatively complex financial products. Mortgage loans have the potential to significantly influence an individual's financial situation. In addition, society might carry the burdens of risky and uninformed decisions about mortgage loans-as the financial and real estate crisis has shown.
   Method: 45 students of economics and business studies in their final undergraduate year participated. They were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental group explored information about mortgage loans using the loan calculator of a German bank. The control group did not explore webpages. Before the intervention, students from both groups completed knowledge tests and self-assessed their financial knowledge and behaviour. After the intervention, students had to work on a case and to decide whether a small family should take out a mortgage loan for financing a house. The decision had to be justified. In addition, students were administered an immediate and delayed knowledge test.
   Results and conclusions: Students of both groups did not differ in knowledge acquisition, decision making about taking a mortgage loan and argumentation quality. However, prior knowledge can be referred to in order to explain the results. Therefore, informal learning using the Internet did not seem to be effective if people did not have sufficient prior knowledge. This result underlines, on the one hand, the necessity of financial education-be it prior to informal learning or in the course of informal learning. On the other hand, the results can be interpreted as a hint to consider how to improve informal learning activities, e.g. by supporting self-regulation or by improving information material.

TI  - An Investigation on Early Voluntary Withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts: An Empirical Study on an Emerging Market
T2  - GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE
AB  - Early withdrawals from individual retirement accounts are one of the main problems of pension companies in both developed and emerging countries. The aim of this study is to identify the potential reasons behind decisions to withdraw early from the individual retirement system in Turkey. Using Cox proportional hazards model, we find that there is a significant negative relationship between financial literacy and withdrawal probability. Our results reveal that men and younger individuals are more likely to make an early withdrawal. We also find that individuals who experience liquidity constraints and income shocks tend to withdraw their contracts earlier. Further analysis suggests that the effect of variables remarkably changes among different subgroups. We believe that our findings will assist both pension managers and policymakers to design better retirement plans and to take steps to prevent voluntary withdrawals in the long term.

TI  - The financial ambidexterity of the immigrant entrepreneurs: a conceptualization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR & RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose Access to financing has long been identified as a stumbling block for the economic endeavors of immigrant entrepreneurs (IEs) in host countries. Yet, little is known about the internal enablers for the IEs success to overcome their financing barriers in host countries. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to introduce the theoretical concept of the financial ambidexterity of IEs as a potential behavioral ability some IEs develop over time to access financing in both host and coethnic contexts. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses sociopsychological lenses to introduce and discuss the term "financial ambidexterity of IEs" by synthesizing empirical evidence drawn from the different literature on immigrant entrepreneurship, biculturalism, financial literacy and cultural intelligence. This discussion is carefully embedded within the framework of the immigrant entrepreneurship literature. Findings The study proposes and discusses the role of bicultural identity integration, cultural intelligence and financial literacy in enabling the "financial ambidexterity of IEs." It further defines the "financial ambidexterity of IEs" as their ability to explore and exploit financing opportunities, either simultaneously across the contexts within which they are embedded, e.g. coethnic and mainstream, or alternately in one context when barriers occur in the other. Originality/value The paper mainly contributes to the literature on immigrant entrepreneurship by suggesting an explanation for how IEs overcome financing barriers in their host countries, and why some IEs are more successful in that than other peers. Moreover, the paper attempts to advance the understanding of immigrants' entrepreneurial endeavors using a sociopsychological lens that considers cultural, cognitive and knowledge-related factors.

TI  - Stock return ignorance
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Optimal stock investment decisions rely on assessments of the distribution of expected returns. Using a representative sample, we find over half the US population cannot answer simple questions on expected stock returns. Respondents who are unable to make any return prediction, who cannot answer questions on the distribution of expected returns, or who reveal unlikely distributional beliefs participate less in the stock market and have smaller stock investments. However, overoptimistic investors are more likely to participate in the stock market and have larger stock investments. These results persist after controlling for financial literacy, intelligence, education, and demographics. People who are ignorant about stock return distribution are more likely to invest in equities if they have higher levels of trust. Therefore, trust can substitute for cognition as a factor positively associated with individuals' propensity to invest. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Consumer financial education and risky financial asset holding in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Risky financial asset holding is arguably a desirable financial behaviour that contributes to consumer financial well-being. However, studies about associations between consumer financial education and risky financial asset holding in China remain limited. To fill this gap, using data from the 2015 China Household Finance Survey, this study examined the association between financial education and risky financial asset holdings and explored its mediators. Results from Probit regressions showed that financial education was positively associated with the household risky financial asset holding. Further analyses based on the mediating model found that financial literacy, economic and financial information search and risk tolerance were mediating factors in the association between financial education and risky financial asset holding. The results have policy implications for improving consumer financial education and financial market participation.

TI  - Financial Planning for Retirement: The Mediating Role of Culture
T2  - RISKS
AB  - The life expectancy rate of individuals worldwide has risen, and Saudi Arabia is not excluded. Rising long-life expectancy may jeopardize employees' pensions and reduce the chances of adequate earnings and a decent life after retirement. Moreover, the number of employees, who have paid into pension funds and are now retired, has increased, indicating that pension funds are expected to decrease. Apart from the above, the level of financial literacy in Saudi Arabia was substandard. Therefore, the ultimate objective of this research is to examine the measurable factors that could impact employees in their financial planning for retirement (FPR). These factors comprise the employee's financial literacy (FL), financial risk tolerance (FRT), and cultural factors based on the CWO model. Moreover, this study aims to investigate the mediating roles of culture in their relationship with financial planning for retirement. Primary data was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic from mid-July 2020 until the end of January 2021 using a non-probability convenience sampling approach involving 525 participants. The Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique was used to analyze the data. To determine the type of study variables, either a formative or reflective model of Confirmatory Tetrad Analysis (CTA-PLS) was used. The results show the significant influence of basic FL, FRT, and culture on FPR. Moreover, it shows the critical role of culture among those with advanced FL and FRT. Previous studies have examined FL and FRT in FPR without considering the effect of culture as a mediator.

TI  - M-Wallet Adoption in Emerging Markets: A Combination of Technological, Behavioral and Financial Aspects in a Rational Choice Model
T2  - PERSPECTIVES ON GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The adoption of mobile wallets can help to advance financial inclusion and human development in emerging countries. Current literature on mobile wallet (m-wallet) adoption focuses on technological and behavioral aspects, but neglects the financial aspect, which highly influences the decision-making of low-income people. This study identified the impacts of all three aspects on m-wallet adoption behavior by including behavioral technology acceptance factors and financial-related factors into a research framework derived from rational choice theory. Drawing data from 214 respondents across four emerging countries, the findings reveal the positive effects of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and network externalities on m-wallet adopting intention. Regarding financial factors, while perceived risk negatively affects adopt-ing intention, the effect of price value on adopting intention is not confirmed. Finally, financial literacy is found to have both positively direct and moderating effects on the relationship of perceived risk and users' adopting intention.

TI  - Mindsponge-Based Reasoning of Households' Financial Resilience during the COVID-19 Crisis
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The COVID-19 crisis was remarkable because no global recession model could predict or provide early notice of when the coronavirus pandemic would happen and damage the global economy. Resilience to financial shocks is crucial for households as future crises like COVID-19 are inevitable. Therefore, the current study aims to examine the effects of financial literacy and accessibility to financial information on the financial resilience of Vietnamese households through the lens of an information-processing perspective. The Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics was employed on a dataset of 839 samples for the investigation. We found that households of respondents with better financial knowledge and investment skills are less likely to be financially affected during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, but the effect of investment skills is weakly reliable. Accessibility to financial information through informal sources (having a household member working in the financial sector) and formal sources (participating in a financial course) is positively associated with the respondents' financial knowledge and investment skills. This finding suggests that the spillover effect of financial knowledge and skills among residents exists, leading to better resilience toward financial shocks. However, if the financial information is inaccurate, it might lead to misinformation, false beliefs, and poor economic decisions on a large scale.

TI  - Mitigating Financial Investment Polarization: The Role of Digital Payments in Enhancing Household Participation
T2  - EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
AB  - This study examines the impact of digital payments on household financial asset investment, using the China Household Finance Survey (2013-2019). Our findings indicate that digital payments positively affect financial market participation and investment size, reshaping asset allocation structures. While households using digital payments show increased participation and investment amounts across various financial assets, a reduction in the weight of deposits is evident. The study highlights two key channels through which digital payments influence financial behavior: enhancing subjective financial literacy and increasing households' attention to financial information. The research emphasizes the role of digital payments in mitigating polarization effects in household financial asset allocation.

TI  - SWITCHING TO CASHLESS? EXPLORING COSTS OF SWITCHING INTENTION IN MOBILE PAYMENT SERVICES
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPUTING AND ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
AB  - The concept of a cashless society has received increasing attention due to the prevalence of cashless transactions and the circulation of digital currency. The benefit of a cashless society is that mobile payment allows efficient, convenient, transparent, and traceable transactions. This study examined the influence of switching costs on customer satisfaction, stickiness, and intention to switch to mobile payment services. We also studied the effect of financial literacy on mobile payment services. Self-efficacy is irrelevant for experienced mobile payment users in terms of customer satisfaction and stickiness. Financial switching costs and self-efficacy (procedural switching costs) have no influence on user satisfaction and stickiness toward mobile payment services, whereas risk tolerance (procedural switching costs) and social influence (relational switching costs) positively influence these two factors. User stickiness partially mediates the relationship between user satisfaction and users' switching intention toward mobile payment services. Our findings can help mobile payment enterprises focus on operational strategies and enhance the reputation of social networks to increase user satisfaction.

TI  - Navigating knowledge and ignorance in the boardroom: A study of audit committee members' oversight styles
T2  - CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTING RESEARCH
AB  - Using data collected from 21 interviews with audit committee members (ACMs) of Canadian reporting issuers, this study examines the ways in which ACMs understand and enact the additional responsibilities placed on them by regulators in the post-Sarbanes-Oxley Act era. Adopting a social constructivist approach to knowledge and expertise, the study shows that despite the financial literacy requirements for ACMs, financial expertise is far from being uniformly understood by ACMs. Indeed, ACMs perceive expertise in many different ways, which leads them to engage in a wide variety of practices to fulfill their responsibilities on audit committees (ACs). The analysis of the data makes it possible to identify three oversight styles-observing, inspecting, and storytelling-that illustrate the differences in how ACMs understand their role, prepare for AC meetings, invest time in this preparation, and develop lines of questioning. These findings provide empirical insights into both the substantive and symbolic roles of ACs and illustrate the role of knowledge and ignorance in shaping ACMs' understanding of their oversight role. This study also raises questions about the soundness of having ACs oversee multiple different processes. By highlighting that ACMs do not comprehend and enact their role uniformly, this study reveals the important nuances in ACMs' oversight approaches.

TI  - Trust in Financial Markets: the Role of the Human Element
T2  - RBGN-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GESTAO DE NEGOCIOS
AB  - Purpose - This paper suggests that the human element is key when it comes to investors' trust in financial markets. Ignoring it may jeopardise the effectiveness of the recent regulatory growth. The study takes a demand-based perspective, assuming the relationship between financial advisors and investors is based upon trust, and it analyses the conditions that may lead to the existence (or not) of trust.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) of data collected from 366 questionnaires, we are able to test, in a qualitative non-parametric way, the conditional arguments that may lead investors to trust (or not) their financial advisor.
   Findings - The results show that trust conditions differ, depending on the degree of investors' participation in financial markets. The way investors with a basic relationship with financial markets perceive the behaviour of their financial advisors is key in establishing (or not) their trust. For investors with a more advanced relationship with the market, trust (or its absence) also depends on investors' characteristics. In particular, their financial literacy plays a more-than-negligible role. The joint analysis of the conditions leading to trust and its absence highlights the robustness of our findings.
   Originality/value - By understanding the conditions that establish trust, financial institutions can design strategies to strengthen the level of investors' confidence in their services, improving the relationship between market players, and increasing business. From the supervisory authorities' point of view, the approval of a code of conduct for financial advisors, taking into account our results, can help improve the overall trust in financial markets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to apply Butler's (1991) psychometric scale and the fsQCA methodology to study investors' trust in financial advisors.

TI  - Five steps to planning success: experimental evidence from US households
T2  - OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
AB  - While financial knowledge has been linked to improved financial behaviour, there is little consensus on the value of financial education, in part because rigorous evaluation of various programmes has yielded mixed results. However, given the heterogeneity of financial education programmes in the literature, focusing on 'generic' financial education can be inappropriate and even misleading. Lusardi (2009) and others argue that pedagogy and delivery matter significantly. In this paper, we design and field a low-cost, easily-replicable financial education programme called 'Five Steps', covering five basic financial planning concepts that relate to retirement. We conduct a field experiment to evaluate the overall impact of Five Steps on a probability sample of the American population. In different treatment arms, we quantify the relative impact of delivering the programme through video and narrative formats. Our results show that short videos and narratives (each takes about 3 minutes) have sizeable short-run effects on objective measures of respondent knowledge. Moreover, keeping informational content relatively constant, format has significant effects on other psychological levers of behavioural change: effects on self-efficacy are significantly higher when videos are used, which ultimately influences knowledge acquisition. Follow-up tests of respondents' knowledge approximately 8 months after the interventions suggest that between one-quarter and one-third of the knowledge gain and about one-fifth of the self-efficacy gain persist. Thus, this simple programme has effects both in the short run and medium run.

TI  - Predicting Stock Market Investment Intention and Behavior among Malaysian Working Adults Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of risk tolerance, financial well-being, financial literacy, overconfidence bias, herding behavior, and social interaction on stock market investment intention and stock market participation among working adults in Malaysia. Adopting the cross-sectional design, this study collected quantitative data from a total of 349 respondents in an online survey via Google form link across various social media platforms. This study used the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach to test the hypotheses. This study revealed the significant positive effects of risk tolerance, herding behavior, and social interaction on stock market investment intention. Stock market investment intention also had a significant effect on stock market participation. Stock market investment intention was also found to successfully mediate the relationships of risk tolerance and overconfidence bias with stock market participation. When it comes to stock market investment, the government and related authorities should focus on developing programs and policies that provide a financial safety net for investors and promote investment-related social platforms. This study linked risk tolerance, financial well-being, financial literacy, overconfidence bias, herding behavior, social interaction, stock market investment intention, and stock market participation. This is one of the few early attempts to address issues in light of the stock market investment participation among the working adults in a developing country.

TI  - Financial knowledge of university students in Korea and Germany
T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB  - This study compares the financial knowledge of Korean (N = 1006) and German (N = 1346) university students. The country-specific adaptations of the US-American Test of Financial Literacy was used to assess financial knowledge. Financial knowledge can be divided into three areas (everyday money management; banking; insurance). German students show a slightly higher knowledge of everyday money management and insurance. Korean students tend to be stronger in the area banking. The paper examines the impact of gender on financial knowledge and the role of financial information gathering. A gender difference is determined in Germany, but not in Korea. Male students in Germany score higher than female students. An analysis of variance shows that Korean as well as German students who inform themselves more frequently about financial topics achieve a higher financial knowledge score. The article shows that it is possible to validly measure financial knowledge in Germany and Korea, which have different economic systems.

TI  - Development of a Battery for the Measurement of Financial Capabilities in Young People
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - Measuring financial capabilities among young people poses a challenge for scholars. In this study, we developed a set of ten scales to assess various behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the construct. We designed a pool of items and invited 746 participants, aged 16 to 29, who were divided into two groups for studying the psychometric properties of the tests. The first group underwent an Exploratory Factor Analysis, while the second group underwent a Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Through these analyses, we identified five dimensions of financial behaviors, four dimensions of financial attitudes, and one dimension of knowledge or financial literacy. The scales were combined to measure two financial capabilities: Financial Saving Capability and Responsible Debt Management Capability. Furthermore, we identified distinct profiles of young people associated with each proposed financial capability. Finally, we offer a conceptual discussion of the financial capabilities construct, present scales with reliable and valid measurements, and propose avenues for future research.

TI  - Locus of control and investment in risky assets
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Internal locus of control is an important personality trait strongly related to many economic outcomes. We show that the probability to own equity and the share of equity in household portfolios increase with people's internal locus of control. We explore, and find no evidence for, the hypothesis that this relation is driven by a link between internal economic locus of control and subjective expectations about the return and risk of investment in equity. The relation between locus of control and investment in equity also remains after controlling for risk and time preferences, financial literacy, overconfidence, optimism, trust, and other personality traits. We also show that locus of control has a stronger relation with investment in equity for financially illiterate investors. Our results document a strong and robust relation between locus of control and investment behaviour that cannot be explained by leading behavioural investment theories. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - This research uses data from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study to investigate the attributes of households that engage in higher levels of family financial planning. Greater levels of financial planning are evidenced when households report more positive responses in planning for retirement, saving for emergencies, and establishing a will. Based on an ordinal logistic regression, various demographic attributes, objective and subjective financial knowledge scores, frequency of participation in financial education, and the frequent use of financial websites or apps to help with financial tasks are positively related to higher levels of family financial planning. The results have implications for financial literacy education and the development and marketing of websites and apps for personal finance.

TI  - Dimensions of financial inclusion in India: a qualitative analysis of bankers perspective
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - PurposeThis qualitative study aims to examine bankers' perspectives regarding financial inclusion, the challenges it faces and the scope for improvement. This research proposes a financial inclusion model, considering the inputs received by bankers. Financial exclusion of different sections is an issue common to emerging countries.Design/methodology/approachData for qualitative research were collected through interviews with bank officials. The information was gathered from 32 bankers from India's several zones (North, South, West and East). The data were collected from bankers from different public and private sector banks. Thematic analysis was performed up to the point of saturation to study the response received from bankers.FindingsBank-related issues such as frequent computer problems, network connectivity problems, costs, a shortage of bank branches, fewer transactions through automated teller machines and a shortage of banking staff affect customers' confidence in formal banking. Banking services are disrupted by a lack of trust in banking correspondents (BCs), as they are not regular employees of banks. Limits on daily transactions discourage high-value customers from using BCs and kiosks. The time spent on administrative formalities impacts customers. Financial inclusion is affected by availability, accessibility, usage and affordability. Digital financial literacy is essential for ease of transaction, but awareness about financial products helps protect customers from cyber scams. The findings of this research would benefit financial institutions globally in developing their businesses and helping to achieve financial inclusion and the United Nation's sustainable development goals (SDGs).Originality/valueThis research paper undertakes a qualitative analysis of the views collected from bankers. Bankers are crucial stakeholders in the successful implementation of the National Financial Inclusion Policy of the Government of India. Bankers' perspectives will be important not only for India and its researchers but also in the global context, as the UN's SDGs focus on leaving no one behind.

TI  - Can gamification improve financial behavior? The moderating role of app expertise
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore potential benefits of gamification (application of game-playing elements) for financial well-being and motivation to save.
   Design/methodology/approach - A preliminary survey of college students explored how gamification principles incorporated into money-savings/personal finance smartphone apps could improve financial well-being. The main study utilized Mechanical Turk participants, exposing them to financial game app descriptions that emphasized social features (e.g. leaderboards and ability to share achievements) or economic features (e.g. ability to earn real money or a higher interest rate). Objective and subjective financial measures including expertise with financial apps, perceived benefits of financial apps and behavioral intentions were examined.
   Findings - Financial worry, financial literacy, subjective knowledge and expertise with money-savings/financial applications predicted financial well-being. Additionally, consumers varied in their preferences for certain financial game app features based on past financial app experience. Those who already used a financial app tend to exhibit higher subjective (though not objective) knowledge, and want both "social" and "economic" features of financial applications, whereas those with no experience are more motivated by economic features.
   Practical implications - These results could be used to guide game designers regarding which features may be more attractive to consumers depending on their prior expertise with financial smartphone applications. Financial services marketing would benefit from further research into whether smartphone financial applications that emphasize social features have benefits for consumers' motivation and financial well-being.
   Originality/value - Examining college students about to enter the real world and the general population, this project contributes to research to improve understanding of financial well-being by examining how already having a financial gamification application impacts perceptions of knowledge and expertise, as well as intentions to save given a more socially focused vs economically focused savings app. Additional research needs to further explore gamification as an experimental intervention to ultimately improve both subjective financial well-being and objective financial behaviors, especially for consumers with lower expertise and high risk of financial vulnerability.

TI  - Worker saving attitude towards retirement planning: A study on Indian textile industry
T2  - INDUSTRIA TEXTILA
AB  - The uneven and polarised nature of development has propagated disparities in access to services. Uncertainties in the textile sector have not only affected the economy but have impacted the livelihood of workers dependent on this sector. Systematic retirement planning could have eased the anxiety and inconvenience to a larger extent but was non-existent to a larger extent. This has further become a critical problem as life expectancy has grown, as have health-care expenditures. The purpose of this research is to look at the link between saving attitudes about "personal financial planning and retirement planning behaviour "of workers from textile factories within the industrial area of Solapur and Pune, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. A total of 200 workers were polled, and the chi-square test with regression analysis tested the data. The study found a strong association between the idea of financial awareness and superannuation planning within textile workers leading to improved savings attitude. Workshops, seminars, and other mediums of communication were revealed as means for improved retirement savings. A sound financial attitude may not be limited to the stages of retirement financial behaviour; a potential issue for future research would be to use the created financial literacy scale to explore its association with a broader spectrum of financial behaviour.

TI  - The ABCs of Financial Education: Experimental Evidence on Attitudes, Behavior, and Cognitive Biases
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - This paper uses a large-scale field experiment in India to study attitudinal, behavioral, and cognitive constraints that can stymie the link between financial education and financial outcomes. The study complements financial education with (i) financial incentives on a financial literacy test to affect participant motivation, (ii) financial goal setting to provide a psychological nudge, and (iii) personalized financial counseling to enhance the intensity of treatment. The analysis finds no impact of financial incentives on learning but significant effects of both goal setting and counseling on real financial outcomes. These results identify important complements to financial education that can bridge the gap between financial knowledge and behavior change.

TI  - Exploring undergraduates' money-management life: insight from an emerging economy
T2  - YOUNG CONSUMERS
AB  - Purpose Undergraduates are expected to be future leaders responsible for business and nations. Given that sound financial decision-making is critical to their success in their careers and lives, it is important to understand the money-management behaviour of undergraduates. In the context of developing countries, the body of knowledge on money-management behaviour is dominated by functional financial literature and there is little research on factors beyond this. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring economic, social and psychological factors that influence money-management behaviour of undergraduates in a developing nation (Sri Lanka) and how undergraduates respond to these influences. Design/methodology/approach The study used a qualitative exploratory approach. Data collection was carried out using focus group discussions and individual interviews amongst undergraduates in a leading Sri Lankan state university. Findings The results indicate that undergraduates adopted both careful and risky money-management approaches. The subthemes, specifically identified under economic, social and psychological factors, revealed how undergraduates responded to each of these factors and the influence of contextual and cultural differences in their money-management behaviour. Research limitations/implications - Findings of the study revealed the importance of promoting innovative educational strategies to change the dependability mindset of undergraduates and to promote stress-management strategies that will assist them to enhance their personalities and creativity in making financial decisions. Theoretical and practical implications and future research directions are provided. Originality/value The literature scores in developing context are limited to exploring the existing pattern and the levels of the functional financial literacy. This study has deepened the authors' understanding of how the developing context affects undergraduates' response to the factors relating to their money-management behaviour. The findings from this study will be useful to government, financial institutions, educational institutions, parents and those who have a keen interest in encouraging healthy money-management behaviour in undergraduates.

TI  - Financial Fraud Among Older Americans: Evidence and Implications
T2  - JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - Objectives: The consequences of poor financial capability at older ages are serious and include making mistakes with credit, spending retirement assets too quickly, and being defrauded by financial predators. Because older persons are at or past the peak of their wealth accumulation, they are often the targets of fraud.
   Methods: Our project analyzes a module we developed and fielded on people aged 50 an older years in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Using this data set, we evaluated the incidence and prospective risk factors (measured in 2010) for investment fraud and prize/lottery fraud using logistic regression (N = 1,220).
   Results: Relatively few HRS respondents mentioned any single form of fraud over the prior 5 years, but 5.0% reported at least one form of investment fraud and 4.4% recounted prize/lottery fraud. Greater wealth (nonhousing) was associated with investment fraud, whereas lower housing wealth and symptoms of depression were associated with prize/lottery fraud. Hispanics were significantly less likely to report either type of fraud. Other suspected risk factors-low social integration and financial literacy-were not significant.
   Discussion: Fraud is a complex phenomenon and no single factor uniquely predicts victimization across different types, even within the category of investment fraud. Prevention programs should educate consumers about various types of fraud and increase awareness among financial services professionals.

TI  - Can Access to Financial Markets Be an Important Option for Rural Families to Break the Return to Poverty Due to Illness in China?
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Background: In China's post-epidemic era, the income of rural households has decreased, and the function of property preservation and appreciation is expected to weaken, which gives the financial market an increasingly prominent role in blocking the barrier of poverty caused by disease. Method: Based on CHARLS data, this paper empirically explores the relationship between financial assets and health expenditure and catastrophic health expenditure (representing the incidence of return to poverty due to illness) to provide evidence for the development of financial markets to help stop the return to poverty due to illness and consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation. Results: The results show that the influence of financial assets on the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures is significant and has a threshold effect. At the same time, financial assets have a greater impact than housing on preventing the return to poverty due to illness. Therefore, moving to the financial market can be a viable option for rural households to stop the return to poverty due to illness in the future. Policy suggestion: The government should standardize the development of the financial market and scientifically allocate financial resources to ensure the stable preservation and appreciation of household financial investment. Rural family members should actively improve personal financial literacy and reasonable planning of family assets to achieve stable preservation and appreciation of family financial investment.

TI  - GameStop or Game Just Started? Leveling the Playing Field for Social Media Meme Investors to Rebuild the Public's Trust
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Against the GameStop frenzy in 2021, this article defines meme investors as a new group of investors in financial markets while demonstrating meme investors' regulatory and social implications. By comparing meme investors with traditional investors under the MiFID II regime, this article finds that meme investors are significantly less wealthy than traditional investors, trade via digital trading platforms, and rely on social media information for investment decision making. This article argues that the emergence of meme investors is an expression of the public's desire for financial inclusion and their frustration with traditional financial institutions. Therefore, properly engaging with meme investors is crucial for rebuilding the public's trust towards regulators. After illustrating meme investors' exposure to default risks, legal uncertainty, and online misinformation, this article calls for regulators to engage with social media meme investors and improve financial literacy among the public.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF VALUE-BASED PRINCIPLES ON ISLAMIC BANKING PRACTICES IN MALAYSIA: AN EXPLORATIVE STUDY USING BANK'S DISCLOSURE
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUSANTARA STUDIES-JONUS
AB  - Background and Purpose: This study aimed to understand banking practices to legitimise their role in society and meet stakeholder needs in terms of their products and services. This study narrowed its scope to use the underpinning thrust of value-based intermediation (VBI) as it is a primary pillar of the VBI framework. Towards these same ends, the study also sought to gauge how banks integrated their products and services with the framework.
   Methodology: This study employed the triangulation approach, which comprised of a content analysis of annual reports of the bank and trend analysis of court cases. This study used Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (BIMB) as an explorative study.
   Findings: The findings indicated a decrease of total occurrences over the years on litigation cases involving BIMB, related to know-your-customers compliance. Meanwhile, the analysis of annual reports of the bank indicated that shariah non-compliance incidents are due to operational failures and lack of shariah knowledge among the staff. This study highlighted the need for the banks to strengthen the know-your-customer compliance, besides enhancing and promoting Islamic financial literacy and ethics to their stakeholders.
   Contributions: This study contributes a novelty in this area of study by using data triangulation on court cases and annual reports to provide a more comprehensive perspective on the issue. This study also added to the current literature on VBI, especially within Malaysian context.

TI  - Determinants of individuals' objective and subjective financial fragility during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE
AB  - We examine determinants of the objective and subjective financial fragility of 2100 individuals across Australia, France, Germany, and South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective financial fragility reflects individuals' (in)ability to deal with unexpected expenses, while subjective financial fragility reflects their emotional response to financial demands. Controlling for an extensive set of socio-demographics, we find that negative personal experiences during the pandemic (i.e., reduced or lost employment; COVID-19 infection) are associated with higher objective and subjective financial fragility. However, individuals' cognitive (i.e., financial literacy) as well as non-cognitive abilities (i.e., internal locus of control; psychological resilience) help to counteract this higher financial fragility. Finally, we examine the role of government financial support (i.e., income support; debt relief) and find that it is negatively related to financial fragility only for the economically weakest households. Our results have implica-tions for public policymakers, providing levers for reducing individuals' objective and subjective financial fragility.& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - EFFECT OF EDUCATION ON EASE OF DOING BUSINESS IN CONDITIONS OF INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT: FACTOR ANALYSIS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION
T2  - MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS
AB  - Education accelerates changes and transformations in social life, as well as one of the main factors of progress and development in general and business. The article substantiates and formalises the relationships between indicators of the level of education (taking into account its innovative development) and the ease of doing business based on evidence from 28 world countries and the data from the World Bank, the United Nations, Tufts University and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. The article aims to find indicators of innovative education that most significantly contribute to the ease of doing business. For this, cognitive analysis of statistical data is carried out, and with the help of descriptive analysis tools, a statistically significant characteristic space of indicators is formed. Checking the density and direction of the relationship is carried out by calculating the values of the Pearson correlation coefficients. The multidimensionality of input feature space is reduced to the four most significant indicators from nine investigated ones (digital development indicator; human development index; digital trust, financial literacy index) using the procedure of principal component analysis and orthogonal transformation using the Varimax method in the Statgraphics Centurion 19 software. The quality of the factorisation is confirmed by Kaiser-Meier-Olkin testing and Bartlett's sphericity testing. As a result of the developed multiple econometric models, which describe the dependence of ease of doing business and the above indicators, and the Backward Stepwise Selection hard screening procedure in Statgraphics 19, a statistically significant model of the effect of digital development on ease of doing business is built. It shows that with the value increase of digital development by 1%, ease of doing business will also increase by 0.79%. The obtained results can be useful to scientists for further research, as well as to change-makers in education and business and all stakeholders in the direction of & DLANGBRAC;business-education & drangbrac; competition.

TI  - Validating Financial Knowledge Scale Using Item Response Theory
T2  - VISION-THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
AB  - It is important to have knowledge about financial products and services to make rational financial decisions. Financial knowledge is a wider term and hence difficult to measure. The previous studies have used various methods and instruments to measure it. But there is a need of comprehensive and validated instrument to measure the financial knowledge. In this study, an attempt has been made to measure financial knowledge using a scale consisting of multiple-choice questions on basic and specific financial knowledge related with banking products and services. Each correct answer has been scored '1' and each wrong answer has been scored '0'. This dichotomous scale has been validated using Item Response Theory. The theory focuses on the appropriateness of the questions (items) included in the scale with respect to difficulty and discriminability. The results reveal that the overall instrument fulfils both the criteria. The test consisting of twenty-two items is reliable as well as valid with the discrimination index having all positive values ranging from 0.23 to 1.96 and the difficulty index ranging from -5.66 to 0.90. The purpose of this article is to encourage the usage of validated scales for the measurement of financial knowledge and discourage the perplexity in the field of financial knowledge and financial literacy.

TI  - Unpacking the importance of intangible skills in new product development and sustainable business performance; strategies for marketing managers
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Firms need sufficient resources (tangible and intangible) and capabilities to build unique products due to customers' demands and choices, market competition and globalization. Despite sufficient resources, many firms cannot build new products according to the customers' preferences and market trends due to lack of marketing capabilities, lack of skilled marketing staff and lack of experienced managers. However, studies have not yet examined what types of intangible skills of marketing managers are prominent for building new products. This study examines the importance of the intangible skills; intellectual captial, financial literacy and business experience in new product development that results in sustainable competitive performance. We used a mixed-method approach; questionnaire (283) and interviews (16) for data collection and then applied structural equation modelling for testing the hypotheses. The results revealed that all the three intangible skills; intellectual captial, financial literacy and business experience significant influence new product development and sustainable competitive performance. However, considering the relative importance, financial literacy and intellectual capital are the most significant predictors of sustainable competitive performance and new product development respectively. Moreover, new product development fully mediates the path between intellectual capital and sustainable competitive performance while it partially mediates the link between financial literacy, business experience and sustainable competitive performance. Considering the importance of tangible resources, our study scrutinized that financial resources have a significant influence on new product development and sustainable competitive performance while technological resources do not play a significant role. This research recommends firms to emphasize on the improvement of intangible skills of the managers in order to build new products that result in sustainable competitive position. This study also recommends marketing managers to improve their financial skills and experience by participating in various seminars and workshops that can spur their new idea generation and new product development capabilities.

TI  - Antecedents of economic empowerment: an empirical study of working women in Delhi-NCR
T2  - GENDER IN MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - Women's economic empowerment (WEE) has emerged as a key component at national and international policy-making agendas. The purpose of this paper is to examine and validate the antecedents of WEE for urban working women.Design/methodology/approach - This study used a descriptive and exploratory research design. A total of 286 responses from women working in the formal sector of Delhi-NCR were collected through self-administered questionnaires on a five-point Likert scale using non-probability quota sampling technique. The sample was controlled for the employment sector, that is, healthcare, education and information technology. Exploratory factor analysis has been performed in the first step to test the data's dimensionality with the goal of producing a set of items that reflect the meaning of the relative construct. Thereafter, confirmatory factor analysis has been used for data analysis.Findings - Digital banking usage (DBU) has been identified as the most significant contributor to WEE.Practical implications - Besides digital banking, government support has also emerged as a key indicator of WEE, necessitating a government policy review to improve WEE. Research findings indicate that, if WEE initiatives are to reach their full potential, they must individually address the extracted factors. This study offers a new framework for understanding and enhancing WEE for urban working women in India.Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to use factor analysis to explore the multi-dimensionality of WEE using the novel dimensions of DBU, women's agency and government support, in addition to the established variables of financial literacy, social norms and workplace human resource policies.

TI  - DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS AND THE CHALLENGE OF FINANCIAL ILLITERACY
T2  - CORNELL LAW REVIEW
AB  - Retirement investing in the United States has changed dramatically. The classic defined benefit (DB) plan has largely been replaced by the defined contribution (DC) plan. With the latter, individual employees' decisions about how much to save for retirement and how to invest those savings determine the benefits available upon retirement.
   We analyze data from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study to show that people whose only exposure to investment decisions is by virtue of their participation in an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan are poorly equipped to make sound investment decisions. Specifically, they suffer from higher levels of financial illiteracy than other investors. This lack of financial literacy is critical because of both the financial consequences of poor financial decisions and a legal structure that relies on participant choice to limit the fiduciary obligations of the employer with respect to the structure and options provided by the retirement plan.
   In response to this concern, we propose mandated employer-provided financial education to address limited employee financial literacy. We identify and discuss three requirements that a financial education program should incorporate-a self-assessment, minimum substantive components, and timing. Formalizing the employer role in evaluating and increasing financial literacy among plan participants is a key step in providing retirement plan participants with the resources necessary to manage important decisions regarding retirement planning and, ultimately, for enhancing the financial security of American workers.

TI  - Determinants of halal food purchase decisions for Go Food and Shopee Food users
T2  - INNOVATIVE MARKETING
AB  - Indonesia is one of the world's biggest halal food product and service consumers. The halal industry will continue to expand as the Muslim community's needs grow. Therefore, application development for online halal food providers through the Go Food and Shopee Food platforms is in high demand. This paper aims to analyze the determinants of Go Food and Shopee Food users' halal food purchase decisions. The theory of planned behavior (TPB), the theory of consumer behavior, and the unified theory of acceptance and utilization of technology (UTAUT2) were used. The research sample consists of Go Food and Shopee Food users chosen randomly from a pool of 104 respondents. The data were collected using a questionnaire developed from previous studies and the theories applied (TPB and UTAUT2). Respondents received questionnaires online via Google Forms. Path analysis was used in this study. The findings show that TPB constructs can adequately explain halal food purchase behavior. The attitude toward the purchase of ha-lal food and subjective norms affect the user's intentions to purchase halal food. The coef-ficients are 0.291 and 0.379, with a p-value < 0.001. The user's intention determines the positive decision to purchase halal food with a coefficient of 0.843 and a p-value < 0.001. Halal awareness is a powerful predictor with a coefficient of 0.206 and a p-value of 0.014. However, perceived behavioral control, halal literacy, religious commitment, financial literacy, and UTAUT2 constructs (price value, hedonic motivation, and habit) were not found to determine the intention to purchase halal food.

TI  - Investigating the relationship between government support and SMEs' sustainability through financial and green lenses
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & INDUSTRIAL MARKETING
AB  - PurposeTo be successful on a global scale, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) need government support (GS) for innovation, sustainability and creativity. GS has always been a constructive influence on enterprises. This paper aims to examine the role of GS in assessing financial literacy (FL), access to finance (AF) and green value co-creation (GVC) for the sustainability of SMEs. Design/methodology/approachThis study's sample comprises SMEs in Lahore, Pakistan. Data collection started in December 2021 and ended in February 2022. Using convenient sampling, 320 responses were collected from SMEs and included in data analysis. Hypotheses were tested, and model fit was checked through the software AMOS 22. FindingsIt has been examined that GS plays a pivotal role in acquiring FL, AF and GVC for the sustainability of SMEs. Research limitations/implicationsIncreasing the sample size will give a more demonstrative picture as the population size is quite large. Future researchers should design causal relationships, linking these variables through longitudinal research. Originality/valueNo study has been conducted on SMEs of developing economies using these variables. This study contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive model and identifying GSs importance in achieving SMEs' sustainability through financial and green lenses. This research significantly impacts government policymakers and SMEs by giving them insight into the importance of green practices, financial capabilities and SMEs' sustainability.

TI  - The causal mechanism of financial education: Evidence from mediation analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - This paper uses a field experiment in India and mediation analysis to investigate the causal mechanisms between financial education and financial behavior. Focusing on the mediating role of financial literacy, we propose a broader definition of financial knowledge that includes three dimensions: numeracy skills, financial awareness, and attitudes towards personal finance. We then employ causal mediation analysis to investigate the proportion of the treatment effect that can be attributed to these three channels. Strikingly, we find that numeracy does not mediate any effects of financial education on financial outcomes. For simple financial actions such as budgeting, both awareness and attitudes serve as pathways, while for more complex financial activities such as opening a savings account, attitudes play a more prominent role-though these patterns appear to be sensitive to confounding. We also compare our mediation analysis results to other empirical techniques that have been typically used to study mechanisms, and we discuss how mediation analysis differs from these approaches.

TI  - MODERN STATE AND POST-WAR PROSPECTS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN UKRAINE CONSIDERING THE EU EXPERIENCE
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - The purpose of the article is theoretical and methodological substantiation of the state and post-war prospects of financial inclusion in Ukraine, taking into account the experience of EU countries. The objectives of the study are as follows: to theoretically substantiate the content and features of financial inclusion, taking into account the experience of EU countries; to assess the current state of financial inclusion; and to outline post-war prospects for the development of financial inclusion in Ukraine. It is argued that the key parameters of financial inclusion are financial well-being, financial behaviour, financial knowledge, and the utilization of financial products, as well as physical access to financial services. Drawing on the experience of EU countries, it is substantiated that creating conditions for free access to financial services for all categories of the population and businesses, as well as their digitalization, contribute to the growth of citizens' income, the simplification of investment mechanisms, and thus the economic development of the country. An assessment of the state of financial inclusion in Ukraine is conducted through online surveys of various categories of citizens. It is determined that Ukrainians feel a strong need for additional sources of income, and the financial situation of the majority of them is extremely unstable. Based on the results of correlation-regression analysis, the priorities of financial inclusion are identified as the level of financial literacy and competency among the population. This will enable them to budget their income and expenses, promote the transformation of savings into investments, and have a positive impact on the post-war recovery of the country's economy.

TI  - SaveWise: The impact of a real-life financial education program for ninth grade students in the Netherlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - This experimental study with a pre-post and follow-up design evaluates the financial education program "SaveWise"for ninth grade students in the Netherlands (n = 713). SaveWise adopts a holistic approach, emphasizing action rather than mere cognition. Benefitting from explicit instruction embedded in real-life contexts, students in the program set a personal savings goal and are coached on how to achieve it. The short-term treatment results indicated that SaveWise expanded the students' level of financial knowledge; encouraged their intentions to save more, spend less and earn an income; and broadly improved their financial and savings behavior. The program demonstrated that it could serve as an effective and low-cost method to enhance the financial literacy of prevocational students, a financially vulnerable group. Although long-term effects were expressed only through financial socialization, this study offers evidence linking curricula to increased knowledge and improved behavior for a specific sample of students.

TI  - Are small finance banks acting as catalysts for financial inclusion in India? A phenomenological study
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to investigate whether small finance banks (SFBs) in India are working towards financial inclusion through qualitative studies. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses a phenomenological approach in which semi-structured interviews were conducted with the employees of two SFBs in Mumbai with different specializations. Employee experience was captured to grasp, interpret and code data for the creation of different themes. Findings This research shows that the current literature on financial inclusion is inadequate to explain the behavior of the needy in India. Study found multiple themes of financial inclusion, namely, financial literacy, self-esteem, use of technology, prompt repayment, credit identity, cross-referencing and financial stability. Although overall results are positive, to generalize the results, SFBs need to spend some more time in business. The findings of this study can be of global benefit to micro-finance organizations of a similar scale to achieve financial inclusion and business improvement. Research limitations/implications This qualitative study was performed at a single location and with a limited sample size, which underlines the need for repeated exercises at multiple locations with a larger sample size to establish a broader logical generality. It also points out the need for a study of employee themes to enhance the business processes of SFBs. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this qualitative study is first attempt to figure out the extent of work done by SFBs in India in promoting financial inclusion. Themes related to financial inclusion can provide further thought process for policymakers for financial inclusion and business improvement. Findings refer not only to Indian organizations but also to small banks around the world to recognize the underpinnings of financial inclusion and what small banks and micro-finance institutions can do to make it meaningful.

TI  - The welfare impact of financial inclusion: a research agenda
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING LITERATURE
AB  - Purpose - This paper provides a systematic review of literature pertaining to the welfare impact of financial inclusion. We identify the 50 most influential publications in the field that have evolved into three distinct categories, each of which we critically review to identify the main contributions of this research area. Design/methodology/approach - By conducting a state-of-the-art literature review, this paper identifies the most influential papers in the research fields on the welfare impact of financial inclusion. One caveat is that as newer publications generally have fewer citations, reviewing prior work can result in a misleading account of emerging trends and research directions. Manual assessment of publications after 2018 facilitates a discussion of important emerging research trends and their directions. Findings - The three key research streams are identified as financial services and financial accessibility, financial capability, and financial literacy and household welfare. By assessing publications from 2018 to 2023, we also document four key emerging research trends: Fintech and digital financial inclusion, sustainability and climate change, growth, poverty, income inequality, financial stability, and Entrepreneurship. Drawing on these emerging trends, we highlight the opportunities for future research. Research limitations/implications - Keyword searches have limitations as some papers might be overlooked if they do not match the specific search criteria, despite their relation and significance to the overall topic of the welfare impact of financial inclusion. To address this issue, we have expanded this review by incorporating more literature from other databases, such as the Scopus database which may alleviate this issue. Practical implications - The three key research streams contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the welfare impact of financial inclusion. The emerging trends integrate existing knowledge and leave the chance for innovative research to expand the research frontier. Originality/value - This paper fulfils the systematic literature review streams in the welfare impact of financial inclusion and provides fruitful opportunities for future research.

TI  - Towards Sustainable Retirement Planning of Wageworkers in Thailand: A Qualitative Approach in Behavioral Segmentation and Financial Pain Point Identification
T2  - RISKS
AB  - Thailand recently reached "aged" society status, signifying that over twenty percent of the population is over sixty. Considering that Thailand has a low literacy rate, a fractured pension system, and no regulations that could provide sufficient income to cover basic needs after retirement, there will be economic repercussions if the situation is not handled soon. The government and financial institutions have been encouraging Thai citizens to prepare retirement plans but lack understanding of the root causes of being unprepared for retirement. The objectives of this qualitative research were to explore the behavior, knowledge, and preparedness towards retirement in governmental and private wageworkers. Moreover, the study aims to identify the pain points of being unprepared for retirement and deliver the optimal solutions and sustainable retirement plans suitable for each segment. This article employed a sample of 46 wageworkers in Khon Kaen, Thailand with ages ranging from 20 to 59 years old. Qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews and qualitative content analysis were conducted with the respondents asking about their income, expenses, pains, and problems towards saving for retirement, their desired outcome after they retire, and how they would achieve it. The framework used for the in-depth qualitative interview was by utilizing the customer, problem, and solution zoom tool. The research contributions were to facilitate Thai citizens being ready for retirement stages and overcome post-retirement risks sustainably. The results revealed that the sample could be divided into four segments by their characteristics. Two low-income segments share the same traits and behaviors that can prove that financial literacy plays an essential role in retirement readiness. Lower-income wage workers do not have their money put in place to prepare for retirement. Additionally, this article discussed the study's implications for wageworkers, employers, and the Thai government. This article recommended that Thai citizens should accumulate wealth in various ways, including investment in financial assets and earning additional income from a second job. Employers should provide suitable retirement contribution schemes. The government should launch a policy enabling above-60-year-old seniors to continue working.

TI  - Tax morale: Framing and fairness
T2  - ECONOMIC SYSTEMS
AB  - Tax morale has been a focus of academics and policy makers for some time. The measurement of individuals' tax morale is subjective, and various proxies have been employed in qualitative and quantitative research. The framing of these measures has been considered in some research with respect to equivalency or goal framing, but the underlying implication of emphasis framing in commonly used proxies has yet to be considered. Further, although fairness and financial literacy have been considered determinants of tax morale, no one has yet considered whether financial and tax literacy (FTL) has a moderating effect on fairness and tax morale. This research addresses these gaps in the literature. The findings suggest that questions and scenarios posed by academics and policy makers should consider positive, negative, and emphasis framing, as well as the moderating effect of the respondents' FTL to measure individuals' tax morale effectively. The findings also suggest that raising levels of FTL could have a double dividend: not only will improved FTL have a positive impact on tax morale, but it might be magnified through the impact of fairness. These findings hold only when morale is determined by negatively framed scenarios. In particular, the perceived fairness of the tax system enhances tax morale when FTL is high, whereas the perception of fairness has no effect on tax morale for respondents with lower levels of FTL.

TI  - Sustainable Debt Behaviour and Well-Being of Young Adults: The Role of Parental Financial Socialisation Process
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Literature shows that parental financial socialisation plays an important role in attaining financial literacy as well as in shaping sustainable financial behaviours and that both translate into increased well-being indicators and financial security on micro- and macroeconomic levels. However, debt literacy and debt behaviour seem to be unique. Very little is known about the childhood financial socialisation process through which adults' sustainable debt behaviour is shaped and how debt behaviour may affect well-being. This study tests a hierarchical model of childhood financial socialisation consisting of five levels: the anticipatory parental socialisation, and later life financial learning outcomes (particularly, debt literacy levels), financial attitudes, debt behaviour, and well-being. Using data collected from a purposive sample of young adult Poles (N = 600) during the period from 10 to 13 November 2018 and employing structural equation modelling, we have found evidence confirming the hierarchical relationship of literacy-attitude-behaviour. Our data do not support, however, either the hypothesised positive relationship between parental socialisation and objectively measured debt literacy or the assumed relationships between debt behaviour and well-being indicators. We posit that country-specific factors related to generational differences entailed by system-wide transition and the specificity of debt behaviour, respectively, are key for explaining these empirical deviations from the assumed conceptual framework. Finally, we found no significant differences between the models estimated separately for maternally conditioned and paternally conditioned respondents.

TI  - Financial Awareness among Women in Delhi NCR: A Comparative Study
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Gender Equality in recognized as one of the economic objective of all the nations around the world. In spite of various measures taken to ensure financial inclusion globally, it has been found that women are still unable to access the formal financial system (World Bank, 2015). Financial inclusion aims at making easy access of financial services to all sections of the society including the underprivileged. For financial inclusion to take place the pre requirement is that people should have basic understanding of the financial concepts like budgeting, interest rates, time value of money, inflation, debit-credit, money management, investment, banking products, risk-return, etc. Low levels of basic financial understanding leads to ineffectiveness and inefficiencies in making economic decision. Demographic factor, socio-economic factors, education level, workplace activity, etc. are related to individual's level of financial awareness. Understanding the intensity of the impact of such factors on their basic financial understanding level among different categories of people is essential for effective policy making that aims at achieving financial well-being of all people including the underprivileged. Hence the current study aims at exploring basic financial literacy level among females in Delhi NCR. The online survey was carried out with questionnaire as the research instrument on a sample of people from Delhi NCR region using convenience sampling technique. The collected data was analyzed using Non-Parametric test of independent samples Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test. The study identified that there is a significant difference in the basic financial awareness among different age groups and employment status among the women in Delhi NCR. But the difference in the basic financial awareness among different education level among the women was insignificant in Delhi NCR.

TI  - Empirical nexus between financial and psychological entrepreneur characteristics and its analogy to entrepreneurship financial performance
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose
   This study aims to examine the key entrepreneurial roles (financial literacy, risk tolerance and competency) in the financial performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Pakistan and the mediating effects of locus of control and spiritual and emotional quotients.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study data was collected from 541 SMEs in Pakistan (the target population) through a survey and analysed with partial least squares structural equation modelling.
   Findings
   The findings revealed that the key entrepreneurial characteristics were positively related to locus of control and spiritual quotient and elevated the financial performance in entrepreneurship. It was also reported that locus of control and spiritual quotient mediated between key entrepreneurial characteristics and financial performance. In this regard, emotional quotient strengthened the existing relationships between key characteristics, locus of control and spiritual quotient.
   Practical implications
   This study highlighted sustainable implications for SMEs to develop an effective mechanism and improve financial performance through guidelines that emphasized entrepreneurial characteristics and behaviours towards positive entrepreneurial ventures. This study also enabled policymakers to design policies that catalysed SME performance in Pakistan.
   Originality/value
   This study contributed a novel concept of key entrepreneurial characteristics by introducing a characteristics tool kit. Consequently, information on a unique framework (by integrating entrepreneurial characteristics and financial performance) and literature on spiritual quotient and locus of control in entrepreneurship were enriched. Contributions to the regulatory focus theory and four-phase Rubicon model in the study context were also made.

TI  - Has Greater Stock Market Participation Increased Wealth Inequality in the Us?
T2  - REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH
AB  - Is wider access to stockholding opportunities related to reduced wealth inequality, given that it creates challenges for small and less sophisticated investors? Counterfactual analysis is used to study the influence of changes in the U.S. stockholder pool and economic environment, on the distribution of stock and net household wealth during a period of dramatic increase in stock market participation. We uncover substantial shifts in stockholder pool composition, favoring smaller holdings during the 1990s upswing but larger holdings around the burst of the Internet bubble. We find no evidence that widening access to stocks was associated with reduced net wealth inequality.

TI  - Cultivating Self-Control in FinTech: Evidence from a Field Experiment on Online Consumer Borrowing
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
AB  - We report the results of a longitudinal intervention with students across 5 universities in China designed to reduce online consumer debt. We allocate participants to either a financial literacy treatment group, a self-control treatment group, or a zero-touch control group. Our self-control training intervention features detailed tracking of spending and borrowing, budgeting, and introspection about consumption choices. This intervention reduces online borrowing and delinquency charges, mainly driven by a reduction in entertainment-related spending and borrowing. In contrast, financial literacy interventions improve test scores but only marginally affect borrowing. Our results suggest that cultivating self-regulation and budgeting skills can improve borrowing behavior on e-commerce platforms.

T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Using a large, non-student sample, we assess and differentiate between borrowers' Risk Aversion and Ambiguity Aversion levels and their willingness to pay to resolve a mortgage default settlement negotiation. Ambiguity Aversion is found to be negatively associated with willingness to pay for borrowers with high financial literacy in both the gain and loss domains, whereas personality traits matter more for borrowers with low financial literacy. This finding is important to policymakers in that they should adopt differential resolution strategies for defaulting borrowers based on these intervening variables.

TI  - Divergence between economic growth and stock market performance in India: implications for investor education and financial well-being
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Amidst declining trends of Indian macroeconomic indicators during COVID-19 period, certain indicators, which can be takes as proxies of investors' behaviour, sentiments and biases, were discerned in Indian securities markets. The study provides significant insight into sentiments and biases of a particular segment of retail investors trading in uncertain times of COVID-19, whose investment behaviour may have serious impact on their financial well-being in the long-term. This exploratory-descriptive study uses data collected by various regulators and government sources in India and abroad to evaluate the behaviour of investors in the backdrop of macroeconomic trends during COVID-19. After analysing the trends of investor participation, trading behaviour and general sentiment in the Indian capital markets and evaluating the implications of these investor-related behaviours on the financial well-being of individual investors, a comprehensive and segmented approach of financial literacy has been recommended to safeguard financial well-being of investors.

TI  - Accounting and finance literacy and entrepreneurship: An exploratory study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate whether the level of financial literacy differs signif-icantly among entrepreneurs in three European countries: Italy, Spain, and the UK. Moreover, I analyze whether financial literacy fosters or hinders entrepreneurial resilience and success. I find that the level of basic financial literacy is significantly lower among entrepreneurs in the UK. I provide an explanation based on job opportunities arguing that basic financial literacy increases the chances of survival of a business, whereas advanced financial literacy decreases it. I propose a taxonomy linking levels of financial literacy with different approaches to financial management. I conclude that a "conservative" approach to financial management (cash based, debt-averse and diversified) is more likely to guar-antee survival even if it is not necessarily the best way to maximize firm value.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Financial capability and financial wellbeing of women in community-based organizations: mediating role of decision-making ability
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose Financial capability is considered to be an important concept that has drawn the attention of many world nations. While the literature suggests various studies on financial capability and financial wellbeing, focus on their combined significance has been limited. The purpose of this paper is to examine how financial capability affects the financial wellbeing of women in community-based organizations and how decision-making ability mediated this relationship. Design/methodology/approach In total, 1,000 women who are associated with the community-based organization - Kudumbashree in the state of Kerala, India participated in the survey-based study. Findings The structural equation modelling results show that there exists a significant relationship between financial capability and the financial wellbeing of women in CBOs. Further, decision-making ability was identified as a significant mediator in this relationship thus establishing a partial mediation effect. Practical implications The financial social workers can focus their activities on promoting financial capability and decision making aspects of women from middle/low income families to facilitate their financial wellbeing. The scope for financial socialisation and proper orientation is more for the women associated with the community based organisations. This opportunity can be made use by the government authorities and other practitioners to change their financial outlook and contribute towards the empowerment of these women from the grass root level. Originality/value The studies related to financial literacy and financial inclusion are available in the Indian context, but the conceptualization of financial capability is still an under-researched area in India. Hence, this study is an attempt to explain the capability-wellbeing relationship from a financial point of view in the Indian context, and further establishes its connection with the individual's decision-making ability. To strengthen the research base, the study was conducted among the women in the community-based organization who belong to middle and low-income families.

TI  - Who starts a self-managed superannuation fund and why?
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - Self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) - small retirement savings funds with four or fewer members - now manage almost one-third of retirement savings in Australia, and serve over 1 million members. The number of SMSFs has increased to more than half a million in two decades, yet little is known about the reasons people start the funds and how they operate. We use a survey of more than 500 SMSF members and 500 large superannuation fund members to analyse why SMSF members commence and manage their own fund, compared to similar people who stay with a large fund. We find that control over investments and tax minimisation are the most common reasons for starting a SMSF, while satisfaction with large funds and unwillingness to take on the administrative burden of self-management are the most common reasons for not doing so. SMSF members do not show any greater financial skills than non-members, but they do display overconfidence, a higher risk tolerance and a more trusting attitude to financial professionals. Model results show that the majority of SMSF members start their funds at the suggestion of financial professionals. We also show that those who say they are thinking about starting a SMSF are different in significant ways from the eventual SMSF members, further evidence of the influence of the advice industry.

TI  - Does Regulation Influence Microfinance Institutions to Be More Client-Responsive?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - The regulation of microfinance services is likely to have a wide-ranging influence on the microfinance sector, particularly on institutions and their clients. This paper reveals the impact of a specific regulatory regime, the "Microcredit Regulatory Authority Act, 2006", enacted by the Bangladesh government to monitor and supervise nonprofit nongovernment organizations (NGOs). We analyzed survey and interview data provided by clients of both nonprofit microfinance institutions (MFIs) registered under the Act and nonprofit institutions that are unregistered, all lending only to women. Client-level analysis using fixed effects for specific MFI membership is applied, focusing on the role of regulation by comparing protections as consumers of financial intermediations in terms of financial literacy, awareness, and status of clients of registered and unregistered MFIs. We found compelling evidence of a positive association between the financial status, financial literacy, and financial awareness of clients of registered MFIs, but not unregistered MFIs. These findings support the need for MFIs to implement consumer protection measures and inform their consumers about key issues to achieve improved client outcomes.

TI  - Relations between young adults' knowledge and understanding, experiences, and information behavior in personal finance matters
T2  - EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AB  - Background: In Germany, general secondary education offers few opportunities for young adults to acquire knowledge and understanding of personal finance. Hence, apart from parents' influence as role models, important influences on young adults' financial knowledge and understanding likely include their personal experience with financial products and their behavior of informally seeking information about specific financial products.
   Methods: In this paper, we investigate the relationships between these latter variables based on a sample of 1108 young adults from Germany, aged 17-25, beginning their studies in higher education. Knowledge and understanding of personal finance was assessed using the German adaptation of the US Test of Financial Literacy. In this paper, we focus on the dimension 'Banking' (covering financial investing, saving, using credit). In addition, we surveyed young adults'experience in basic personal finance matters (e.g., having a bank account, using a credit card, paying for rent) and their information behavior towards specific financial products (e.g., stocks, investment, retirement plans, and insurance).
   Results: The data set was prepared through multiple imputation and analyzed using regression models. The results show clear correlations between knowledge and understanding in the dimension 'Banking'and both experience and information behavior in personal finance matters.
   Conclusions: Our findings illustrate how important it is that young adults obtain experience with and actively inform themselves about financial products, particularly in countries such as Germany where personal finance is not taught extensively and systematically in school.

T2  - NURSING ECONOMICS
AB  - Financial literacy, or the knowledge and skills contributing to informed and effective decisions of managing personal money, should be viewed as a subset of health literacy. To initiate nurses on the path from novice to expert, mastery of the health savings account is explored. Educating patients about financial literacy may benefit from nurses' approach to educate patients about medication literacy. Nurses should be empowered to employ financial literacy supporting self-care, share financial literacy with patients, and act as ambassadors of financial literacy to the public.

TI  - Assessment of users' adoption behaviour for stock market investment through online applications
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Investing in stocks has become increasingly accessible, with beginners able to start an account via a brokerage's website or mobile app with very little money. Online trading through applications allows you to trade independently without a broker's interference. This not only lowers the overall cost of trading but also makes it hassle-free, increasing the value of the business significantly. Using an online trading account gives an investor more control. This paper examined the user's perspective on stock market investment through online applications. The impact of users' awareness, benefits & choice of investment, reliability, safety, risk-related factors, financial literacy, technical aspect, and dependency was analyzed on users' adoption behaviour. An empirical survey with a valid sample of 424 respondents from India was collected from the respondent and analyzed using descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, reliability analysis, analysis of variance, and regression analysis. Results indicated that users' awareness, benefits & choice of investment, reliability, safety, risk-related factors, financial literacy, technical aspect, and dependency significantly influence the users' adoption behaviour in using stock trading applications. The findings will assist potential investors in comprehending the factors influencing the adoption of such apps and aiding the organizations engaged in operating or creating such applications in understanding user behaviour, which will significantly add value to the society at large.

TI  - Choosing the highest annuity payout: the role of intermediation and firm reputation
T2  - GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE
AB  - In this paper, we analyse retirees' decision-making from the different bids made available by life insurance companies in the Chilean annuity market. We find that choosing the highest annuity payout was positively (negatively) correlated with the advice given by independent brokers (sales agents and average years of education in the municipality) for a January 2008-May 2018 sample. We also found that retirees were willing to pay for firm reputation. In addition, people who are more likely to take a pension payout without consulting intermediaries are older, married, have a higher pension balance and purchase an immediate annuity. These findings are of interest to those seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the annuity system.

T2  - EKONOMSKA MISAO I PRAKSA-ECONOMIC THOUGHT AND PRACTICE
AB  - Pension literacy represents a set of knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and skills related to pensions and the pension system that are required for an optimal decision about one's retirement. The aim of this paper is to study the pension literacy of students at the University of Zagreb and, by analyzing students' behavior, knowledge, and attitudes about pensions and the pension system, to identify the biggest weaknesses of students in this area and scope for further education. This study encompasses a survey conducted on a sample of 2,100 students and an interview of two focus groups consisting of economists and non -economists. The results of the focus group interviews indicate a significant divergence in attitudes and knowledge between students of the Faculty of Economics and Business and other students, with non-economists showing little interest in this topic. The findings of the survey research confirm the conclusion about the low levels and about

TI  - The Relationship Between Debt Literacy and Peer-To-Peer Lending: A Case Study in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This paper discusses the relationship between debt literacy, peer-to-peer lending, and over-indebtedness in Indonesia. It is essential because the number of loans on this platform continues to increase, both legal and illegal. Data was collected online in collaboration with commercial market research firms, JajakPendapat.net. Debt literacy and over-indebtedness were measured by self-assessment with questions from Lusardi and Tufano (2009a). Questions for debt literacy are about interest compounding, debt interest, and the application of time value of money in payment options. The question for over-indebtedness is about the amount of debt and the conditions resulting from that debt. By using descriptive methods, it is clear that the majority of respondents, both borrowers and non-peer-to-peer lending borrowers are debt illiterate, and those who have poor debt literacy have huge debt. Overall, only 1.85% of the respondents were debt literate. Those who live on the island of Java have better literacy because they are the center of economic growth in Indonesia. Debt from peer-to-peer (P2P) lending also has the potential to create problems, namely over-indebtedness. P2P lending borrowers also have very poor debt literacy. However, there is no difference in debt literacy between P2P lending borrowers and non-P2P lending borrowers.

TI  - RETRACTED: The Nexus between sustainability of business model innovation, financial knowledge, and environment: A developing economy perspective (Retracted article. See vol. 11, 2023)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - This study intends to investigate how aspects such as financial knowledge and the rate of technological advancement influence the lifetime of enterprises in developing nations like Pakistan. For this purpose, a survey study was designed to obtain data from 325 business owners in different parts of the country. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was utilized to analyze this dataset. According to the analysis outcomes, not only do practices connected to financial literacy and innovation play a crucial role in a firm's long-term viability, but they also have a substantial beneficial impact on the company's viability. The research concluded that an increase in financial knowledge, expertise, and experience in corporate operations helps the continued viability of firms. Knowledge of financial concerns also predicted the company's ability to innovate and adapt. In addition to the environmental sustainability of the business. As a result, it was concluded that it plays the role of a mediator in the link between innovation and the ongoing existence of businesses. Because of this, financial literacy is now acknowledged as a vital knowledge resource for determining one's financial course of action, which was not the case previously. According to the study's conclusions, for businesses to continue to be sustainable, authorities need to enhance their financial literacy level and adopt sustainability models into their day-to-day operations.

TI  - Determinants of Private Long-Term Care Insurance Purchase in Response to the Partnership Program
T2  - HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - ObjectiveTo assess three possible determinants of individuals' response in their private insurance purchases to the availability of the Partnership for Long-Term Care (PLTC) insurance program: bequest motives, financial literacy, and program awareness.
   Data SourcesThe health and retirement study (HRS) merged with data on states' implementation of the PLTC program.
   Study DesignIndividual-level decision on private long-term care insurance is regressed on whether the PLTC program is being implemented for a given state-year, asset dummies, policy determinant variable, two-way and three-way interactions of these variables, and other controls, using fixed effects panel regression.
   Data Extraction MethodsAnalysis used a sample between 50 and 69years of age from 2002 to 2010, resulting in 12,695 unique individuals with a total of 39,151 observations.
   Principal FindingsWe find mild evidence that intent to bequest influences individual purchase of insurance. We also find that program awareness is necessary for response, while financial literacy notably increases responsiveness.
   ConclusionsIncreasing response to the PLTC program among the middle class (the stated target group) requires increased efforts to create awareness of the program's existence and increased education about the program's benefits, and more generally, about long-term care risks and needs.

TI  - Buy Now, Pay Later Loans, Social Norms, and Consumer Indebtedness
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - The terms associated with new financial products, such as buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans, are often cloudy. Policymakers are concerned because these products are marketed to na & iuml;ve consumers who may be in financial peril. While financial illiteracy has received attention, it is also important to recognize that consumers are impacted by perceptions of the choices of those in their social network. We elicit empirical and normative expectations in an incentivized experiment to measure what young people think others will do and their beliefs of the beliefs of others. Our experimental participants are more likely to purchase an item with a BNPL loan, as compared to a credit card loan, and the majority believes others see this as a good choice. We conclude that consumers are likely to increase indebtedness when offered a payment scheme that is supported by a social norm.

TI  - Women empowerment, attitude toward risk-taking and entrepreneurial intention in the hospitality industry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CULTURE TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose First, this study aims to investigate the factors affecting entrepreneurial intentions. Second, it is to identify the influential factors with the highest influence on entrepreneurial intention. Design/methodology/approach The sample of the current study was female employees in various hospitality firms, including restaurants, hotels and wellness services. The questionnaire was developed based on past research studies and was tested for reliability prior to the full set of data collection. To represent the early to mid-level career women in hospitality, female employees with at least one-year experience from hospitality businesses, such as restaurants and hotels, participated in the study and total usable samples were 416. Findings The findings demonstrated that attitude toward risk-taking, self-efficacy, subjective norm and empowerment is significantly influential to the entrepreneurial intention of the women in the hospitality industry. Based on the data analysis, attitude toward risk-taking has the highest influence on entrepreneurial intention. In other words, with a positive attitude toward risk-taking, female employees showed the greatest tendency to start their own business. Research limitations/implications The current study extended the theory of planned behavior in that it can be used to explain the women's entrepreneurial intention with subjective norms, attitudes and self-efficacy. The study also highlighted the flexibility of the theory in allowing the researchers to add external variables to help further investigate the relationships among all the factors in the models. Practical implications To highlight the opportunity to promote more equality and diversity in the business management environments, the results from the study promoted the roles of women entrepreneurs to support hospitality business development. One of the most influential factors is the attitude toward risk-taking. This suggested that with the positive attitude toward risk, the respondents have higher entrepreneurial intentions. Promoting and sharing the success stories of female entrepreneurs can affect the attitude of female employees and raise their interests toward becoming entrepreneurs. Originality/value The current study provided a unique investigation on the early to mid-level career hospitality female employees to explore their intention to be entrepreneurs. This research offered the extension of the theory of planned behavior in the context of entrepreneurship.

TI  - Digital financial services usage and subjective financial well-being: evidence from low-income households in Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThe first objective of this study is to analyze whether financial behavior (FB), financial stress (FS), financial literacy (FINLIT) and the locus of control (LOC) influence subjective financial well-being (SFWB) among low-income households in Malaysia. The second objective is to investigate whether the use of digital financial services (DFS) moderates the influence of FB and FS, on SFWB.Design/methodology/approachMotivated by the literature on transformative service research (TRS), this study examines how the use of DFS impact SFWB among low-income households in Malaysia. Low-income households are chosen as they are more likely to be financially excluded and lack financial knowledge and skills. Using an interviewer-administered survey, trained enumerators collected data from 1,948 low-income households in Malaysia, selected using a two-stage sampling based on the National Household Sampling Frame obtained from the Department of Statistics Malaysia.FindingsResults reveal that SFWB is positively influenced by FB and the LOC, and is negatively impacted by FS and FINLIT. The evidence shows that the use of DFS counterintuitively weakened the strength of the relationship between FB and SFWB, but effectively reduced the adverse effect of FS on SFWB.Practical implicationsTo reverse the signs of relationship, financial services marketers need to identify the specific types of DFS that low-income households use in order to provide targeted marketing efforts and financial education to promote the use of DFS on a more holistic basis to increase financial well-being.Originality/valueThe findings of this study add to the body of knowledge deliberating on the opposing effects of technology on consumers' welfare and well-being. This study focuses on the lower-income stratum of Malaysian households as this group of the population is more likely to be financially excluded and have deficiencies in financial knowledge and skills. Findings of this study show that DFS use can actually diminish the positive impact of FB on SFWB while reducing the adverse effect of FS on SFWB.

TI  - The performance generating limitations of the relationship-banking model in the digital era - effects of customers' trust, satisfaction, and loyalty on client-level performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - This paper investigates the viability of the relationship-oriented business model. Specifically, it examines the effects of bank customers' satisfaction, loyalty, and trust in bank advisors on two client-level performance measures; client-level non-interest revenue, and client-level revenue on net interest spread. It further investigates how effects are moderated by differences in clients' risk tolerance and financial literacy.
   Design/methodology/approach - The findings are based on analyses of a data set that combines survey data (collected from 13,525 bank clients in 2013) with bank record data from each respondent. The cross sectional data is analyzed using OLS-regression and structural equation modeling.
   Findings - Overall, the findings are that the relationship banking model generates non-interest revenue, but not revenue on net interest spread. In more detail, findings show that trust has a positive direct effect on client-level non-interest revenue. Furthermore, trust mediates the entire effect of satisfaction and loyalty on client-level non-interest revenue. Customer satisfaction and loyalty do not lead to enhanced client-level non-interest revenue if there is little trust in bank advisors. Findings further show that the relevance of trust for non-interest revenue is higher for clients with high risk tolerance and high financial literacy. Satisfaction, loyalty, and trust have no effect, however, on client-level revenue on net interest spread.
   Originality/value - While previous literature mainly has used subjective intentions (e.g., repurchase behavior) as operationalization of performance, this paper combines subjective survey data and objective performance data, allowing the investigation of how the customer relationship model affects actual performance. Furthermore, the paper investigates the relational banking model's effect on non-interest and net interest spread revenue, and we show that the relational banking model generates only non-interest revenue, and not net interest spread revenue. The fine-grained client-level data also allows the investigation on how the effect of trust on client-level performance differs among client groups with different cognitive characteristics (i.e., risk tolerance and financial literacy).

TI  - Adoption intention of mobile QR code payment system among marginalized street vendors: an empirical investigation from an emerging economy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeRecently, the Government of India has emphasized digital financial inclusion for promoting cashless transactions with a vision to transform India from a traditional cash-based economy into a cashless economy. Technology-driven payment apps are facilitated greater access to cashless financial services and improve the speed, efficiency, accuracy and effectiveness of financial transactions. This study aims to explore the determinants of quick response (QR) code mobile payment (m-payment) adoption intention among marginalized street vendors in India. Design/methodology/approachThe proposed research model was tested using 320 responses from QR code m-payment users. An interview schedule was performed using the structured questionnaire from marginalized street vendors by adopting a purposive sampling technique. The proposed research framework of this study developed on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). In addition to the existing variables proposed in the UTAUT model, three more variables have been added, namely, digital financial literacy (DFL), personal innovativeness (PI) and perceived trust (PT). Besides, the study used confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling techniques to analyze the data. FindingsThis study confirms that factors such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, PT and customers' DFL are significant determinants of street vendors' intention to use QR code m-payment services. However, social influence and PI have shown an insignificant relationship with adopting a QR code m-payment system. Research limitations/implicationsThe results provide insights for policymakers and service providers. Specifically, government and bankers design promotional campaigns emphasizing the ease of use, perceived benefits, security and faster business transactions to accept and use the QR code m-payment system to encourage prospective users to achieve a cashless economy. Originality/valueMany prior studies have widely concentrated on m-payment adoption intention in India. However, only a few studies have attempted to examine the factors influencing the adoption of QR code m-payment services among merchants from emerging economies. There is a dearth of studies on QR code adoption from an unorganized sector perspective, specifically marginalized street vendors. Therefore, this study explicitly examines the extent to which the determinants of adoption intention toward QR code-based m-payment services among marginalized street vendors within the framework of the extended UTAUT model by incorporating DFL, PI and PT. The findings of this study contribute, theoretically and practically, to the existing literature.

TI  - Basic debt literacy and debt behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - Using unique survey data from 1001 individuals representative of the French population, we document that less than half of the sample (47%) can provide correct answers to two basic questions addressing the functioning of debt interests. This proportion is higher among credit users, but the improvement emerges mainly from mortgagors (55%) and much less from consumer credit users (51%). Furthermore, among consumer credit users, the portion of respondents giving at least one erroneous answer (i.e. neither correct nor "don't know") is above one third and significantly higher than in the rest of the population (35% vs. 30%). Next, with regressions, controlling for a wide array of socio-demographic variables and potential confounding factors like present-biased preferences or saving-oriented literacy, we show that incorrect answers to debt literacy questions predict a greater propensity to use consumer debt and to use it in a more expensive way (i.e. choosing lower settlements). Lastly, we find that respondents who answer debt literacy questions incorrectly are not more likely to report intention to take financial education training or to seek financial advice from a bank advisor, even when such respondents also present a high propensity to use debt or to use it in an expensive way.

AB  - Purpose Financial education has become an essential component of the economic balance for families, and much is being discussed about the methods, which raise the levels of financial education of the population. Thus, the overall objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of formal and business education on the level of financial education. Design/methodology/approach This research is characterized as a quasi-experimental study, with undergraduate students. As a data collection technique, a structured questionnaire was used. Findings The results confirm the importance of formal and business education, as well as gender, for the financial education of individuals. More specifically, being male and having contact with a greater number of financial disciplines increase the level of financial education of the individual. Originality/value This article demonstrated that the trajectory of the knowledge traversed by individuals within the same level of schooling is of paramount importance. The results show that formal and business education can improve the levels of financial education and reinforce the relevance of strategic actions in this area.

TI  - Testing the role of skepticism in Islamic banks: evidence from Indonesia
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Although there have been several studies on customer intention, no research has specifically examined how skepticism toward Shariah claims affects customer intention in Islamic banking. This study tests the factors influencing customer intentions based on the theory of planned behavior in the context of Islamic banking. Compliance, religiosity, and Islamic Financial Literacy (IFL) variables were used as antecedents of skepticism. This study employed a quantitative research approach utilizing online questionnaires for data collection. Data were collected through an online survey using convenience sampling (a nonprobability sampling technique). The respondents were Muslims in Indonesia who did not have funding or financing accounts in Islamic banks. The sample comprised 210 valid responses. Data analysis was conducted using partial least-squares structural equation modeling. The findings indicate that consumer skepticism toward Shariah claims in Islamic banks is influenced by compliance, religiosity, and IFL and that skepticism affects customers' intention to use Islamic banks. This study is the first to examine consumer skepticism and its impact on user intentions in the context of Islamic banking. Therefore, this study provides insights into how consumer skepticism toward Shariah claims in Islamic banks is formed, which can serve as input for Islamic banking practitioners to implement appropriate marketing strategies.

AB  - Cryptocurrency could redefine the interplay of Internet-connected world markets by eliminating constraints set by traditional local currencies and exchange rates. It has the potential to revolutionise digital markets through the use of duty-free trading. This study investigates the factors which influence the behavioural intention to use cryptocurrency based on the Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM 3) during the COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) pandemic. Data were collected through a cross-sectional questionnaire from 357 Pakistani business-educated adults, including investors who had a rudimentary understanding of the technology and financial instruments. Partial least square (PLS)-based structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the developed theoretical framework based on the Technology acceptance model 3. The PLS model has explained 72.1% of what constitutes the behavioural intention to use cryptocurrency. Surprisingly, risk was not a major consideration. This might be due to the fact that the majority of respondents thought working with cryptocurrency was hazardous. Willingness to handle cryptocurrency risk, on the other hand, might be a stumbling block to acceptance. The most essential aspect of a cryptocurrency's success was the perceived usefulness. Moreover, the moderating role of experience was not substantiated in this study. However, perceived usefulness was identified as a partial mediator of subjective norm and the perceived ease to use. This study contributed to the literature through the application of TAM 3 (an extension of the technology acceptance models) to investigate the fundamental qualities a cryptocurrency should have in order to influence investor's behavioural intention to use it. These findings provide revolutionary insights for the present and future market players for investment planning and for improved cryptocurrencies development.

TI  - Participation in risky asset markets and propensity for financial planning: a missing link?
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - This study examines whether the association between financial literacy and participation in risky asset markets is robust to variation on a more innate level: the propensity for financial planning. I find that individuals' propensity for financial planning is strongly positively related to stock market participation as well as membership in a voluntary workplace retirement savings scheme. This result holds when controlling for financial literacy and a range of demographic and control variables in a multivariate regression setting. Importantly, the positive association between financial literacy and risky asset market participation also persists, suggesting that these two variables operate through separate channels.

TI  - When saving is gambling
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Prize-linked savings (PLS) accounts, which allocate interest using lottery payments rather than fixed interest, encourage savings by appealing to households' gambling preferences. I introduce new data on casino cash withdrawals to measure gambling, and examine how individual gambling expenditures respond to the introduction of PLS in Nebraska using a difference-in-differences design. After PLS is introduced, individuals who live in counties that offer PLS reduce gambling by at least 3% more than unaffected individuals. The substitution effect is stronger in low-frills gambling environments, which most resemble PLS, indicating that these accounts fulfill the desire to gamble. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Drivers of depositor discipline in credit unions
T2  - ANNALS OF PUBLIC AND COOPERATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - In this paper, we analyze whether credit unions are subject to market discipline by their (member) depositors and examine the drivers of such discipline. We first provide descriptive evidence of depositor discipline in credit unions: shares and deposits as well as savings interest rates react to variables that reflect the financial health of the credit union and its asset risk. We show that this discipline is long-lasting and that it is mediated by the existence of a deposit guarantee scheme and by the strength of the relationship of members with the credit union. We then use proxies of the capability of members to process financial information to show that discipline is heavily influenced by member financial sophistication. Our results suggest that a type of market-based discipline acts as a complement for regulation in controlling credit union risk taking, thus contributing to overall financial stability.

TI  - Unlocking sustainable project management: The role of project managers' competencies in resource bricolage from a stakeholder engagement perspective
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Sustainable project management practices have garnered increasing attention in recent years. Consequently, in the age of digitalization and globalization, numerous studies extensively explore the relationship between digitalization and sustainable practice. While optimism abounds, there is insufficient research into how and what types of project managers effectively manage resources to enhance the sustainability of projects when stakeholders are engaged. Therefore, we aim to address this gap by analyzing a sample of 211 Chinese project managers involved in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Our findings indicate that project managers with digital literacy and experience are effective at managing existing resources to promote sustainable project management practices, while project managers with financial literacy do not directly exhibit sustainable practices. Furthermore, digitally literate managers are more likely to engage in bricolage (effective resource management), whereas experienced project managers are less likely to do so in the presence of stakeholder engagement. Moreover, stakeholder engagement does not appear to moderate the relationship between project manager financial literacy and bricolage. Based on these findings, our research recommends that organizations focus on employing digitally literate and experienced project managers to effectively manage their limited resources for sustainable project management. Further practical implications are discussed.

TI  - Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis of Factors Influencing the Use of Cryptocurrencies in Spanish Households
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - This paper assesses the variables influencing the expansion of cryptocurrency (crypto for short) use in households. To carry on the study we apply a consumer-behavior focus and so-called fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). In a previous research, that was grounded on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Partial Least Squares (PLS), we found that main factors to explain the intention to use of cryptos by individuals were performance expectancy (in fact, it was the main factor), effort expectancy and facilitating conditions. We did not found evidences about the relevance of social influence, perceived risk and financial literacy. This study revisits these results by applying fsQCA instead PLS. Empirical research on factors influencing cryto use is relatively scarce due to the novelty of blockchain techs, so the present paper expands the literature on this topic by using an original analytical tool in this context. The main contribution of this paper consists in showing empirically that fsQCA provides a complementary and enriching perspective to interpret data about the use of cryptos. We obtain again that the most relevant factor to explain the intention of using cryptocurrencies is perceived expectancy and that also effort expectancy and facilitation conditions are relevant. But also fsQCA has allowed us discovering that despite social influence, perceived risk and financial literacy were not significant in the PLS model, they impact on the intention to use cryptocurrencies when are combined with other factors. Social influence acts as an "enable factor" for the rest of explanatory variables and it is linked positively with intention to use cryptos. Also financial literacy is relevant because its lack is a sufficient condition for the non-acceptance of that blockchain tech. Likewise we have checked that perceived risk influences the intention of using cryptos. However, this influence may be positive or negative depending of the circumstances.

TI  - A Comprehensive Approach to Measuring Financial Vulnerability and Literacy: Unveiling Connections
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - In the aftermath of the 2007-08 financial crisis, the worsening financial conditions of households increased concerns about their financial vulnerability (FV). In this context, policymakers embraced the notion of financial knowledge to foster sound financial behaviors among individuals and households, aiming to mitigate the detrimental effects of FV on households' financial wellbeing and the overall economy. However, the relationship between FV and financial literacy remains inconclusive. This lack of definitive findings may stem from limitations in measuring FV and narrow focus on specific dimensions of financial literacy. This paper analyzes the relationship between financial literacy and FV by creating a comprehensive measure of (the level of) FV and considering different dimensions of financial literacy. Using a sample of 8,554 individuals in Spain obtained from the 2016-17 Survey of Financial Competences, we construct a continuous measure of FV by using Nonlinear Principal Components Analysis (NLPCA). Then, we employ OLS and ordered probit regressions to examine the potential association between different dimensions of financial literacy and FV. The findings indicate that the level of FV is negatively related to self-perceived financial knowledge, while no statistically significant relationship is found regarding objective financial knowledge. Evidence also reveals that "highly financially included" individuals are more likely to exhibit financial resilience. These findings highlight the need for the development of financial education initiatives that are action-oriented.

TI  - An asymmetrical approach to understanding consumer characteristics in banking trust during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - This study aims to examine how perceived banking management, the perception of the context in which the banking system operates, and other consumer characteristics have interacted to create different recipes of banking trust during the second wave which began in October 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. To scrutinize this configurational reasoning, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was implemented. Using a sample of 1319 Italian respondents, this study suggests that high financial literacy combined with an optimistic attitude during the pandemic are key factors for achieving high banking trust. Furthermore, the results suggest that high perceived conspiracy is linked to low banking trust. These findings can help managers design differentiated strategies to attract depositors and invite the Italian government to double its efforts in restoring the people's optimism.

The respondents were 538 Muslim families in East Java, Indonesia. Structural equation modelling was used for the analysis.FindingsThis study tested 13 hypotheses, of which 10 were accepted. The accepted hypotheses refer to the effects of financial literacy on productivity, financial inclusion on productivity, financial planning on productivity, financial planning on Islamic welfare, education on Islamic welfare, productivity on Islamic welfare, financial literacy and productivity on Islamic welfare, financial inclusion and productivity on Islamic welfare and financial planning and productivity on Islamic welfare, as well as the effects of financial inclusion on Islamic welfare. Meanwhile, three hypotheses were not accepted; they refer to the effects of financial literacy on Islamic welfare, the effect of education on productivity, as well as the impact of education and productivity on Islamic welfare.Research limitations/implicationsThe study was conducted only with respondents living in East Java, so the results depict the condition of Muslim families' welfare in East Java.Originality/valueResearch into the antecedents of Islamic welfare has received little academic attention, so this study explores how education, financial inclusion, financial literacy, financial planning and productivity could affect Islamic welfare among Muslim families.

AB  - We test the effectiveness of an online interactive pension dashboard in improving pension funds participants' ability to make adequate pension decisions in terms of pension preparation, knowledge, self-efficacy, expectations, and intention-to-act. In a randomized survey experiment, treated participants of two pension funds receive an encouragement to visit an online pension dashboard. Treated individuals have more pension knowledge and an increased self-efficacy in the pension domain, especially so for females. The dashboard does not have a significant impact on the pension preparation or the errors in forecasts of pension income nor does it impact the willingness to act if there is a need to do so.

TI  - Global service-learning and business education: the case of Azerbaijan
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB  - This study investigates the development of service-learning models for business school students in Azerbaijan. Drawing on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this study identifies field projects and financial literacy immersions that benefit society while also promoting partnerships between Azerbaijan's business schools, Central Bank, and international non-profit organizations. Based on the conceptual framework of Brower (Academy of Management Learning & Education 10:58-76, 2011) and theoretical underpinnings of Kolb (2015), this article develops two service-learning models for business schools in Azerbaijan and presents new corollaries between issues of sustainable community development, service-learning, and experiential learning theory. In one service-learning model, business school students complete a service-oriented consulting project based on real-world assignments from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In a separate service-learning model, business school students partner with the Central Bank of Azerbaijan and Junior Achievement in exerting servant leadership by serving as mentors for Azerbaijan's schoolchildren in the area of financial literacy. The service-learning models in this study are distinctive and innovative in the context of Azerbaijan, both in terms of management education development and the potential to infuse and teach the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals into the business curricula.

TI  - Parents Influence Responsible Credit Use in Young Adults: Empirical Evidence from the United States, France, and Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - From the start of adulthood, consumers are frequently faced with complex financial decisions, and the consequences of these decisions may be reflected throughout the rest of their lives. As access to credit has expanded among college students around the world, it is critical that we understand both universal and culture-specific processes. Although some work has examined credit card use in two cultures simultaneously, there is, to our knowledge, no research examining such use in three cultures on three continents and across both genders. This study analyzes credit card use behavior among 1458 young adults living either in Brazil, the United States, or France. A structural equations model is used to incorporate relationships between the latent variables. The model, which was validated by the study, examines how financial well-being is affected by the way in which the individual uses credit cards, which in its turn is affected by social comparison and by financial self-confidence, the latter being also impacted by the financial education received from the parents. In the comparison between groups we found evidence that men are more dependent on parental education than women.

TI  - Individual Capability and Effort in Retirement Benefit Choice
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND INSURANCE
AB  - We investigate the role of individual capability and effort in the management of retirement ruin. In an experimental setting, we analyze how 854 defined contribution (DC) plan members reallocated wealth between a lifetime annuity and a phased withdrawal account when we increased the risk of exhausting the phased withdrawal account before the end of life. We find that more numerate individuals who put effort into understanding product features chose more longevity insurance at higher ruin risks. Financially literate members were more likely to show understanding of the product features, but general financial literacy did not directly improve ruin risk management. Initiatives aiming to help DC members understand income stream products at the time of the decision are warranted.

TI  - Sowing seeds: The impact of financial socialization on the financial understanding of young children and preschoolers
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - This paper is concerned with the relationship between financial socialization and financial understanding among young children. Measures of financial understanding, appropriate for 4-6 year olds, are developed. Regression analysis is used to relate these measures statistically to a set of financial socialization variables and control variables related to the child, their parents, and their household. Data collected in the nationally representative child and parent 2016 UK Children and Young People's Financial Capability Survey are used. A key empirical finding is that financial understanding is about 10% higher for children whose parents regularly discuss with their children how they spend their money. The analysis suggests that around 20% of parents do not discuss financial matters with their children. It is likely that variation in early-life financial socialization is important in explaining variation in later-life financial understanding. Further research is needed to establish if this relationship is causal.

TI  - Stimulating new business creation through system dynamics education
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose The international community recognizes the role of entrepreneurship education in fostering economic growth and sustainable development. However, preparing the next generation of entrepreneurs is not an easy task, since today's complexity requires the creation of skills and capabilities for which the traditional programs reveal their inadequacy. Some scholars remark how entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intention are not necessarily related and, in line with policy makers' concerns, call for educational programs more routed in financial skills' enhancement. The purpose of this paper is to explore the potential of system dynamics (SD) for entrepreneurial education, investigating the relationships between financial and entrepreneurial skills' formation and business development. Design/methodology/approach The paper introduces the main elements of SD, describes literature streams of SD applications fitting the entrepreneurial education spheres and proposes an SD' insight model based on selected literature and declined in terms of stock-and-flow and causal loop structures. Findings The study provides a causal model capturing the links between the processes of entrepreneurial skill formation and firms' start-ups and closures. Such model introduces a double effect of financial literacy on entrepreneurial orientation and locates the contribution of simulated entrepreneurial decisions in formal and informal educational contexts. Originality/value The paper displays how SD can contribute to entrepreneurship and presents an original causal model highlighting the accumulation of financial and non-financial skills through education and experience, their impact on business development and the usefulness of SD methodology for skill achievement.

AB  - During the global pandemic, the frequency of digital financial services has increased, one of the reasons for which may be the fear of infection, which is not necessarily based on prudent orientation. Nowadays, to navigate in the increasingly digital financial market, it is essential to have the right tools and competencies that help in the use of services. During the population survey conducted in the summer of 2019 - before the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic -, I examined the level of digital competencies in managing finances and its correlations with the level of financial knowledge and the use of electronic financial services. I researched possible gender differences regarding digital competencies, and whether the use of digital tools is dependent of demographic characteristics. I found out that the competencies of women and men led to similar results. However, the development level of one's place of residence is related to the frequency of use of electronic devices.

TI  - Pursuing Long-Term Business Performance: Investigating the Effects of Financial and Technological Factors on Digital Adoption to Leverage SME Performance and Business Sustainability-Evidence from Indonesian SMEs in the Traditional Market
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The traditional market holds a pivotal role in Indonesia's economy because it is the main contributor to national retail grocery transactions. Nevertheless, competition with modern markets and retailers makes their competitiveness lessened. From the financial side, traditional market SMEs are vulnerable to financial risks and still face obstacles in accessing financial resources due to a lack of financial literacy. In addition, the level of digitalization of traditional market SMEs technology is also still low, so digital adoption is still a challenge that must be faced. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the influence of financial and technological factors on the level of adoption of SME technology in traditional markets and its impact on the performance and sustainability of the SME business. This research will be conducted in a quantitative cross-sectional study of 225 SMEs in the traditional market. The sampling technique that will be used is judgmental sampling. This study's research data will be analyzed using SEM-PLS. The study result shows that financial literacy positively affects SME financial accessibility and financial risk. The study also confirms that financial accessibility, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence are variables that significantly affect SMEs digital adoption, while the effect of financial risk on digital adoption is found to be insignificant. The study result also shows that SMEs digital adoption is positively affecting their performance, which eventually affects their business sustainability.

TI  - Protecting investors from themselves: Evidence from a regulatory intervention
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - Retail investors tend to make poor investment decisions and consequently under perform. A plausible approach to improving this situation is to restrict the least knowledgeable or experienced investors, a concept implemented for Singapore investors via a Customer Knowledge Assessment (CKA). I study the empirical relationship between retail investors' investment portfolio outcomes, and their CKA results. Although those satisfying the assessment criteria made fewer mistakes, as benchmarked by a selection of normative models, the CKA only weakly identifies less skilled investors. The high misclassification rate, under an analysis favorable to the scheme, highlights the challenges of investor screening. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improving financial wellbeing in Indonesia: the role of social media as a mediating factor in financial behavior
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - This research examines the impact of an external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, an internal locus of control, and social media on financial well-being, focusing on the mediating role of financial behavior. Financial wellbeing can be improved by reducing the external locus of control, increasing individual financial self-efficacy and financial literacy, and using social media appropriately. Furthermore, the importance of financial behavior is emphasized by the indirect effects of external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, and social media on financial wellbeing. The study features an online survey questionnaire with 438 respondents. The relationships were investigated using PLS-SEM. According to the study's findings, financial influencers are social media data variables that significantly affect financial behavior. These findings can assist policymakers, and business leaders in understanding the most influential factors affecting Indonesia's financial wellbeing. Furthermore, the Indonesian government encourages the younger generation to improve its literacy index through public financial education. Research into financial wellbeing is critical because it aligns with the government's goal of improving the stability and health of the population's finances. Individuals can maintain financial control, allowing them to meet financial goals, manage unexpected expenses during emergencies, deal with financial problems, and enjoy life.

TI  - Investigating the factors of SMEs' business resilience in the post-pandemic crisis of COVID-19 with technology adoption as a quasi-moderator: a multigroup analysis of Indonesian and Malaysian SMEs
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - In spite of the devastating effects of COVID-19 on businesses, many SMEs have demonstrated resilience and continued on with their operations. This study investigates the determinants of SMEs' business resilience in Malaysia and Indonesia, with a focus on the moderating factor of technology adoption. The Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, the Dynamic Capability View Theory (DCV), and the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework were combined to analyze a set of business resilience-impacting factors in each country. Online surveys with respondents were used to gather data. Partial least squares-based structural equation modeling was used to examine a total of 539 respondents, of whom 335 were from Indonesia and 204 were from Malaysia. The results showed that government support, technological use, and compliance costs have a significant direct impact on the business resilience of SMEs in both countries. Notably, it was discovered that there were insignificant effects from financial resources and financial literacy. The association between financial resources and business resilience in Indonesia and the relationship between government support and business resilience in Malaysia are both negatively moderated by technology adoption. The findings of this study contributed to a multigroup analysis between neighboring countries, offering valuable insights on the factors influencing SMEs' business resilience to withstand the COVID-19 crisis and their subsequent recovery. It helps explain how SMEs cope with the epidemic, use government support, and use technology to adapt to the changing business climate. These findings enabled SMEs and governments to use preparation and resilience methods to anticipate future difficulties.

TI  - The College Wealth Divide: Education and Inequality in America, 1956-2016
T2  - FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW
AB  - Using new long-run microdata, this article studies wealth and income trends of households with a college degree (college households) and without a college degree (noncollege households) in the United States since 1956. We document the emergence of a substantial college wealth premium since the 1980s, which is considerably larger than the college income premium. Over the past four decades, the wealth of college households has tripled. By contrast, the wealth of noncollege households has barely grown in real terms over the same period. Part of the rising wealth gap can be traced back to systematic portfolio differences between college and noncollege households that give rise to different exposures to asset price changes. Noncollege households have lower exposure to the equity market and have profited much less from the recent surge in the stock market. We also discuss the importance of financial literacy and business ownership for the increase in wealth inequality between college and noncollege households.

TI  - What Drives Mobile Payment FinTech Adoption in India?
T2  - GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - This study aimed to determine the drivers of mobile payment FinTech adoption. The study was conducted with 306 generation Y (Gen Y) and generation Z (Gen Z) FinTech users, and data were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM) through partial least squares and analysis of variance (ANOVA). The present study investigates some interesting and novel associations among variables that contribute to the literature, such as the mediating effect of effort expectancy, facilitating condition, performance expectancy and social influence between the association of financial literacy and behavioural intention, and investigates the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) constructs (effort expectancy, facilitating condition, performance expectancy and social influence), technology acceptance model 3 (TAM 3) constructs (perceived enjoyment and self-efficacy), financial literacy and demographic features as drivers of FinTech adoption. The results indicate that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, financial literacy and self-efficacy are strong drivers of FinTech adoption. Perceived enjoyment and social influence do not influence users' behavioural intention to adopt mobile payment services.JEL Codes: G41, O30, O31, 033

TI  - Use of business analysis in beef businesses to direct management practice change for climate adaptation outcomes
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
AB  - Beef businesses in northern Australia are facing increased pressure to be productive and profitable with challenges such as climate variability and poor financial performance over the past decade. Declining terms of trade, limited recent gains in on-farm productivity, low profit margins under current management systems and current climatic conditions will leave little capacity for businesses to absorb climate change-induced losses. In order to generate a whole-of-business focus towards management change, the Climate Clever Beef project in the Maranoa-Balonne region of Queensland trialled the use of business analysis with beef producers to improve financial literacy, provide a greater understanding of current business performance and initiate changes to current management practices. Demonstration properties were engaged and a systematic approach was used to assess current business performance, evaluate impacts of management changes on the business and to trial practices and promote successful outcomes to the wider industry. Focus was concentrated on improving financial literacy skills, understanding the business' key performance indicators and modifying practices to improve both business productivity and profitability. To best achieve the desired outcomes, several extension models were employed: the group facilitation/empowerment model', the individual consultant/mentor model' and the technology development model'. Providing producers with a whole-of-business approach and using business analysis in conjunction with on-farm trials and various extension methods proved to be a successful way to encourage producers in the region to adopt new practices into their business, in the areas of greatest impact. The areas targeted for development within businesses generally led to improvements in animal performance and grazing land management further improving the prospects for climate resilience.

TI  - Measuring Bitcoin Literacy in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The purpose of this research is to discuss the concept of measuring cryptocurrency literacy, especially Bitcoin. This research uses a qualitative approach. The data source comes from a literature review on cryptocurrency and opinions from Bitcoin academics, traders, and investors. Data collection was conducted through desk evaluations and interviews to determine what attributes should be considered for assessing Bitcoin literacy. The results of a literature review reinforced by discussion show that eight attributes can be used to assess basic level Bitcoin literacy, namely Bitcoin supply, regulatory guarantees, transaction recording, the role of third parties, treatment of transfer transactions, initial coin offerings, the smallest Bitcoin unit, and conversion with another currency. These eight attributes can be used to measure Bitcoin literacy through various questions with the choice of true, false, and do not know answers. This research is essential because there is no method to measure Bitcoin literacy. This research can be a measuring tool that becomes a reference or standard in assessing or measuring Bitcoin literacy. This study's results provide benefits to the development of science in the form of a tool that can be used to assess Bitcoin literacy and become a standard in assessing a person's level of understanding of Bitcoin.

TI  - Perspectives on evaluation in financial education: Landscape, issues, and studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC EDUCATION
AB  - This review discusses the heterogeneity in the effectiveness of financial education programs that occurs because of the unique conditions for programs and methods to evaluate them. The authors define six groups served by financial education: children, youth, college students and young adults, working adults, military personnel, and low-incomeconsumers. They then discuss research and evaluation literature for each group with a critical eye on program purpose, content, and evaluation. They also present findings affecting multiple groups on four issues: student loans, homeownership, retirement planning, and financial advising. The accumulated evidence on the effectiveness of financial education is positive, although the results are nuanced and sometimes limited. The authors argue that understanding this broad landscape in studying financial education is critical for future research and evaluation.

TI  - Risk Perception-Perceived Investor Performance Nexus: Evaluating the Mediating Effects of Heuristics and Prospects With Gender as a Moderator
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - As the financial condition of most individuals has taken the toll during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aims to analyze varied risk perceptions owing to dynamic behavioral aspects ingrained in individuals. The study primarily incorporates the impact of COVID-19 induced risk perceptions on psychological bias and its aftermath on perceived investment performance, with gender differences being moderators in the aforesaid relationship. A mix of probability and non-probability sampling has been used to collect data from 1,133 respondents through a structured questionnaire. The partial least square structured equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has been employed as an estimation technique. The findings highlight that risk perception has been significant in affecting the heuristics and prospects. However, it is insignificant in directly impacting the perceived investment performance. However, psychological biases, proxied by heuristics and prospects, were found to mediate the relationship between risk perception and perceived investment performance. Practical implications suggest a judicious combination of risk, return, and behavioral portfolio to stimulate, and upscale investments thereby enhancing the investment momentum to reach pre-covid levels. At the same time, the relevance for society lies in the fact that they need to re-consider their investment portfolio to adjust for uncertainties like COVID-19. Future studies can embark on cross country research to investigate varied risk perception-investment performance relationships prevalent in respective economic settings. Also, studies can explore the variation in findings with respect to different classes of investors that is, experiences, first timers, institutional, influencers and others.
   The purpose of the study is to assess the influence of individuals risk perceptions due to psychological bias on their investment performance. The structured questionnaire was shared with prospective respondents and total of 1,133 responses were received. SEM was used to assess the influence of psychological bias on the relationship of risk perception and investment performance of an individual. The findings highlight that with clear understanding of risk perception, people tend to use few mental shortcuts and focus more on rational decision making and better investment performance. Practitioners/portfolio managers/financial planners can design combinations of risk, return and behavioral portfolio to bring investors back in the market in post covid19 investment scenarios. The researchers can build on the findings of the present study by assessing the longitudinal effect of the heuristics and prospects that influence the investment decision of household investors. In terms of assessment of risk, the studies can be conducted by incorporating various personality traits, cultural influences, family influence, exposure to better investment advice and others such additional variables for having a deeper understanding of differences in the risk perceived by different people.

TI  - Linkages of Financial Efficacy, Demographics, Risks Preference and Consumption Behavior in Malaysia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - Financial literacy is one of the sustainable development goals of huge concern of governments. Governments explore solutions addressing policies to improve financial literacy. Nevertheless, financial management has such a broad scope and is not just limited to knowledge. As human nature, individuals are born with different confidence levels that include various financial abilities. This study aims to investigate the household-financial efficacy through the application of psychometric instruments, risk preference, and demographic characteristics toward consumption decision behavior. The research is based on a survey 479 households in the peninsular Malaysia, and utilizes the structural equation model, cluster proportional and systematic random sampling, and two measurements - composite reliability and average variance extracted. Results show that households' financial efficacy is one of the critical factors that explain the households' consumption decision behavior. Also, risk preference, gender and area location (rural or urban) of the household determined the consumption decision behavior of the household. The effectiveness of consumption decision is not only determined by financial literacy, but also financial efficacy. The implications of this paper may help to design policies in narrowing the broad gap between the rural and urban level of financial efficacy. The government needs to take appropriate actions to fix it.

TI  - Personalized Information as a Tool to Improve Pension Savings: Results from a Randomized Control Trial in Chile
T2  - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE
AB  - Forecasting of the outcome of saving for retirement is challenging, particularly for individuals who have limited financial literacy. We explore how reducing that barrier by offering personalized information affects long-term savings. To this end, we randomly offered personalized information or general information within the context of individual retirement accounts in Chile. Personalized information increased voluntary pension savings. Heterogeneity analysis suggests that the updating of priors by information recipients played an important role. However, despite the significant short-term response to the intervention, its temporary nature and limited magnitude are not enough to meaningfully alter the annuity payment that would be obtained from the savings stock.

T2  - RISKS
AB  - The main aim of this study is to explore the conceptual framework of corporate financial culture and its practical relevance in an emerging Central European market economy, at the level of the Hungarian SME, with a special emphasis on the Hungarian SME sector. In our study, we highlight each dimension of corporate financial culture, focusing on the established corporate financial culture index, and within it, we examine the significance of the financial management elements sub-index and the risk and insurance sub-index separately. In addition, we look for logical, causal, and statistically verifiable relationships between corporate financial literacy and the outcome of corporate financial decisions and corporate risk taking. The relationships were broken down over two years in the analysis. Approximately 2167 responses were included in the 2019 sample and 3281 in the 2021 sample. These representative samples were taken from the Hungarian SME sector and multiple linear regression models were built to find a significant moderation effect of financial literacy between perceived risks and the insurance activity of companies. We conducted our research in two different periods, the unique feature of which is that we conducted a survey before and during the coronavirus crisis, so we could make a comparative analysis. The method used in this research study is a literature review analysis of reference manuscripts, discussing topics related to financial literacy, corporate risk management, and corporate financial management, published in the last 10 years. Our results show that there are positive and significant relationships between company management, corporate risk management, and corporate financial literacy. The results of our study draw the attention of company leaders to the practical significance of financial culture-efficiency, profitability, and stability.

TI  - Vulnerability and fraud: evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - This study examines consumer fraud at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and provides novel evidence for the opportunity model of predatory victimization. Scammers have taken advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic shock to exploit victims who are already vulnerable and suffering. The number of fraud cases has greatly increased as COVID-19 spread across the U.S., consistent with the vulnerable-to-become-victimization hypothesis based on the opportunity model of predatory victimization. A Google Trends analysis shows that the increase in fraud and scams is attributable to victims' increased vulnerability rather than to their awareness of fraud and increased motivation to report scams. An improvement in financial literacy is associated with the reduction of finance-related fraud and scams. Finally, we provide important policy implications to protect people from fraud victimization.

T2  - EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Empirical studies of ambiguity aversion mostly use artificial events such as Ellsberg urns to control for unknown probability beliefs. The present study measures ambiguity attitudes using real-world events in a large sample of investors. We elicit ambiguity aversion and perceived ambiguity for a familiar company stock, a local stock index, a foreign stock index, and Bitcoin. Measurement reliability is higher than for artificial sources in previous studies. Ambiguity aversion is highly correlated for different assets, while perceived ambiguity varies more between assets. Further, we show that ambiguity attitudes are related to actual investment choices.

TI  - Building Financial and Health Literacy at Older Ages: The Role of Online Information
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Improving financial and health literacy is an important step in reducing economic vulnerability in older age, yet the means by which individuals accumulate these types of human capital remains an open question. This article evaluates the impact of online search activities on the levels of financial and health literacy. We find that using the internet for such information increases literacy significantly: doing so frequently (versus not at all) increases financial literacy by 16%, and health literacy by 12%. Our results are robust to alternative measures of financial literacy. They are also robust to an instrumental variable approach using other web skills such as email use to proxy for how individuals use the internet.

TI  - Financial capability of people with low income: Results from the Canadian financial diaries
T2  - POVERTY & PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - Household income, assets, and socioeconomic context influence people's financial behavior and their financial literacy. This study uses a mixed methods financial diaries to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the finances of 28 Canadians with low income. Contrary to results from national surveys on financial literacy, we found that these low- and modest- to middle-income participants were careful with their finances by doing things such as paying of one's credit card immediately, deliberately focusing on needs, and tracking one's finances. There were cases of decisions that seemed to harm the participants longer-term financial wellbeing but, in many cases, barriers in banking, the labor market, and government support programs prevented a better choice.

TI  - The Disparate Effect of Nudges on Minority Groups
T2  - REVIEW OF CORPORATE FINANCE STUDIES
AB  - We compare the effect of a text message sent to mobile phones on the actions of minority groups versus the general population in Israel. Using proprietary data from a dedicated survey, we show that the text message had an overall positive effect, but a significantly smaller effect on minority groups. We provide insights into potential channels (low digital literacy, low financial literacy, and low trust) that contribute to the differential effect. This evidence suggests that policy interventions relying on voluntary take-up by participants may be disproportionately taken up by nonmarginalized groups, an unintended effect that can exacerbate rather than mitigate disparities.

TI  - Model intention to success amongst Muslim SME businesses: an exploratory study and future research
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING
AB  - Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia have a significant impact on the economy, contributing 38.3% of GDP in 2022, and so serve as the backbone of the nation. Entrepreneurs' intention to success and their demographic attributes play a crucial role in SMEs' future growth (Delmar and Wiklund, 2008). This paper utilises the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to analyse and propose numerous determinants of attitude (ATT), subjective norms (SN), and perceived behavioural control (PBC) toward success intention among Muslim SMEs. Further, age, education, and gender to model Muslim SMEs' intention to succeed are also analysed. This study contributes to the understanding of entrepreneurs' intention to success and their demographic attributes that may lead to successful SMEs, in particular among Muslim SMEs in Malaysia.

TI  - A New Money Attitudes Questionnaire
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
AB  - This study reports on the development and validation of a new questionnaire to measure money attitudes and beliefs. In all, 268 participants from diverse backgrounds, who were recruited online, completed a 30-item questionnaire. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses verified a five-factor model. The factors were labeled: Achievement and Success, Power and Status, Mindful and Responsible, Saving Concerns, and Financial Literacy Worries. Results showed that demography (sex, age, and education), ideology (politics and religious practices), and self-rated happiness, success, and adjustment were related to alt five factors, particularly the first two. Worries about Financial Literacy is an important and neglected factor in money attitudes research, which has implications for consumer well-being and protection. Limitations and implications are noted.

TI  - Remittances and the financial capabilities of migrant households in the Philippines
T2  - ASIAN AND PACIFIC MIGRATION JOURNAL
AB  - This exploratory mixed methods study sought to determine the financial capabilities of remittance-receiving households from two rural municipalities in the Philippines: San Nicolas in Ilocos Norte province and Moncada in Tarlac province. The broader concept of financial capabilities not only looks at people's financial literacy but also their financial inclusion (access to financial products) and financial functionings (actions on finance). Quantitative household surveys and qualitative data gathering methods that fall under a rapid qualitative inquiry (RQI) design were employed. Results and findings show that more remittance households from San Nicolas saved, invested, and did business in their hometown compared to counterpart migrant household respondents from Moncada. Differences in migrant households' levels of financial literacy, as well as the geographic make-up and economic activities of the two municipalities, may help explain why one municipality had more migrant investors, savers, and entrepreneurs over the other.

TI  - Determinants of indebtedness among young adults: Impacts of lender guidelines, explicit information and financial (over)confidence
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - For most people, borrowing money is a necessary aspect of life in the 21st century. Wisely handled, loans give consumers access to consumption too expensive for most individuals to purchase with cash, such as homes and cars. However, history shows that taking on too much debt can be detrimental for the individual consumer as well as society as a whole. In this paper, we investigate determinants of over-indebtedness among young adults. We perform three studies in a setting focused on buying and borrowing money for a home. We show that, compared with an overall mortgage amount, explicit information about monthly payments reduces the tendency to take on too much debt (Study 1), that the amount borrowed depends on standards regarding the loan amount communicated through guidelines from the lender (Study 2), and that borrowers who are overconfident about their financial abilities tend to borrow more than less confident individuals (Study 3). These determinants and their policy implications are discussed.

TI  - What I Know, What I Think I Know, and Whom I Know
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Drawing on social cognitive theory and social network literature, this study examines how objective financial knowledge (OFK) and financial knowledge network intensity (FKNI) influence retirement investment decisions through the mediation of subjective financial knowledge (SFK). Using survey data, we find that OFK and FKNI enhance 401(k) account holders' risk-taking and investment quality. We also find a unique role of SFK in retirement investment decisions: SFK mediates the effect of OFK on risk-taking, not on investment decision quality. While the interaction between OFK and FKNI does not influence investment decision quality through SFK, it does positively influence risk-taking through the mediation of SFK, which implies that OFK and FKNI serve as complements to each other in risk-taking through the mediation of SFK. We suggest that individuals may reap benefits from financial literacy and financial network-building programs for improving retirement investment decision-making.

TI  - Individual investors' intention towards SRI in India: an implementation of the theory of reasoned action
T2  - SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore and comprehend the reasons behind individual investors' intention towards socially responsible investment (SRI) in the Indian stock market along with examining the validity of the theory of reasoned action (TRA) model to predict such phenomenon in the Indian context. Design/methodology/approach The TRA has been used as an underlying framework and has been extended by adding four variables, namely, moral norms, environmental concern, financial literacy and financial performance. The study used a self-administered questionnaire and adopted a convenience sampling method for a survey to collect the data from the individual investors from the capital cities of three states of India. Further, the collected data have been analysed using two-step structural equation modelling. Findings Results of this study indicate a significant impact of attitude, subjective norms, moral norms, financial literacy and financial performance on investors' intention towards SRI; however, no significant relation was found between environmental concern and investors' SRI intention. The multiple squared correlation (R-2) shows that the final model could explain 71% of the variance in investors' intention towards SRI, which signifies a successful implementation of TRA model along with new additions to predict investors' decision-making behaviour for SRI. Moreover, investors are found to be highly concerned primarily about their financial goals and then for their personal obligation towards society as far as SRI is concerned. Practical implications This study reports significant and prominent importance of subjective norms in SRI which could be a strategic theme for the government and the policymakers to influence investors through their opinion leaders to promote SRI. The government should also increase its efforts to facilitate financial literacy among citizens. Originality/value Using the TRA model and four variables, namely, moral norms, environmental concern, financial literacy and financial performance addition to its original variables, this study extends the understandings of SRI which is perhaps the novelty of this paper because such examination of SRI has not been conducted, especially in the case of developing countries such as India.

TI  - Superannuation retirement balances: A surprising outcome
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL ON AGEING
AB  - AimAlthough the guaranteed superannuation system is believed by many to provide a safe and adequate source of funds in retirement, some will be unpleasantly surprised. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the significant effect of the economic cycle on the final accumulated balance in superannuation retirement accounts.
   MethodA Monte Carlo simulation is used to illustrate the variance in outcomes that can be expected for a hypothetical individual.
   ResultsThe expected accumulated superannuation balances for two hypothetical individuals are estimated. The spread of outcomes is used to illustrate the problem of using only the mean of the distribution as a predictor of wealth in the retirement years.
   ConclusionsMany retirees rely on superannuation to fund their retirement. However regular contributions to superannuation does not ensure a predictable outcome, and active management of contributions is required if retirement goals are to be met.

AB  - We track low-income respondents in the longitudinal Health and Retirement Study for 23 years, to observe how their financial situations unfolded as they aged. We document that (a) real incomes remained relatively stable as individuals entered retirement and progressed through their later years; and (b) labor force participation declined and thus earnings became less important with age, while Social Security and retirement savings rose as a proportion of annual income. Low-income people near retirement also tended to fare poorly during retirement.

TI  - Research Advances on Financial Inclusion: A Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - With intensifying competition in the financial system, new strategic applications are constantly being devised in the search for greater efficiency. In consequence, decisions are commonly based on locating and retaining market segments with high added value, and those which fail to supply the profitability required by the market are "excluded". The aim of this study is to analyse the research advances made in the field of financial inclusion and the main lines of investigation currently being addressed by means of a bibliometric analysis. Among the scientific community, there is growing interest in this study area. The most assiduous in this respect are SA Asongu (the most productive author), Enterprise Development and Microfinance (the journal that has published the most articles in this field), Makerere University, Uganda (the most productive institution) and India (the country where most recent studies have taken place). Foreseeably inspiring future research, there is currently great interest in developing a more accessible financial system, especially through the use of digital money (Fintech) as an instrument to promote financial inclusion. For all this, a line of research is proposed that also includes the proposals from the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - We use data from a Dutch data set, the DNB Household Survey, annually covering the period 1996-2015, to study the relationship between informal parental saving education received when people were children or adolescents and two variables aimed to capture adult individuals' concerns for their future: planning horizon and future orientation. Our results indicate that the general future orientation positively correlates with informal saving education, and in particular having received financial teachings. Our findings also suggest that the future orientation index is rather stable over time (which is not trivial, especially because our dataset covers two full business cycles) and declines with age following the life-cycle.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MULTINATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Predicting worker's effort is important in many different areas, but is often difficult. Using a laboratory experiment, we test the hypothesis that confidence, i.e. person-specific beliefs about her abilities, can be used as a generic proxy to predict effort provision. We measure confidence in the domain of financial knowledge in three different ways (self-assessed knowledge, probability-based confidence, and incentive-compatible confidence) and find a positive relation with the actual provision of effort in an unrelated domain. Additional analysis shows that the findings are independent of personal traits such as gender, age, and nationality. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Digital customization of consumer investments in multiple funds: virtual integration improves risk-return decisions
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE
AB  - Digital technology in financial services is helping consumers gain wider access to investment funds, acquire these funds at lower costs, and customize their own investments. However, direct digital access also creates new challenges because consumers may make suboptimal investment decisions. We address the challenge that consumers often face complex investment decisions involving multiple funds. Normative optimal asset allocation theory prescribes that investors should simultaneously optimize risk-returns over their entire portfolio. We propose two behavioral effects (mental separation and correlation neglect) that prevent consumers from doing so and a new choice architecture of virtually integrating investment funds that can help overcome these effects. Results from three experiments, using general population samples, provide support for the predicted behavioral effects and the beneficial impact of virtual integration. We find that consumers' behavioral biases are not overcome by financial literacy, which further underlines the marketing relevance of this research.

TI  - How Confident Are Personal Finance Teachers? A Survey of High School Instructors in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - Nonprofit organizations and regional universities have increasingly offered professional development opportunities for potential personal finance teachers as states and school districts have increasingly required high school students to take personal finance courses. Yet, current measures on teacher confidence and dispositions shadow these updates. This article employs unique data on high school teachers to estimate their confidence levels, professional development take-up, and attitudes about teaching personal finance courses in schools. The results show that 95% of teachers are confident in teaching personal finance. Teachers with licensure outside of business or economics were more likely to take up professional development in personal finance instruction. Meanwhile, 86% of teachers support a graduation requirement for personal finance instruction in high school. These findings suggest that high schools have the capacity to teach personal finance but also underscore the need for low-cost, easily accessible professional development opportunities.

TI  - Measuring public-involving economic crime: A case study in Beijing, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW CRIME AND JUSTICE
AB  - Public-involving economic crime refers to economic crimes that use false propaganda to obtain money or other valuable items from multiple, unspecific victims in the Chinese context. Based on the Beijing public-involving economic crime cases from 2012 to 2018, this study analyses the operation features and effects of public-involving economic crimes. We find that the intersection in criminal and civil procedures, inefficient property preservation, repeat prosecution, and inappropriate information disclosure remain the major judicial dilemmas of public-involving economic crimes. We examine the causes of public-involving economic crimes from the opportunity perspective. Lack of effective regulation and inadequate financial literacy among investors creates opportunities that offenders can easily exploit. This study suggests that practical administrative efforts such as continuous supervision of market entities? economic activities and financial literacy education can block crime opportunities and prevent public-involving economic crimes.

TI  - What Factors Influence Customer Attitudes and Mindsets towards the Use of Services and Products of Islamic Banks in Bangladesh?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This empirical paper aims at measuring customer attitudes concerning Islamic banking services and how they influence their behavioural intentions to utilise them. Islamic banking has been a fast-growing sector, offering products and services according to Sharia law. Despite being the preferred choice of banking, there is a high percentage of Muslim customers who have shifted from conventional to Islamic banking. Hence, this study aims to examine factors that influence them towards the use of Islamic banking. This is cross-sectional research, where data were collected using questionnaires. A total of 490 questionnaires were received back from adult individuals who were clients of Islamic banks. The data were analyzed using the partial least squares (PLS) method. The findings indicate that ethical organisation, Islamic values, and reputation significantly impact attitudes, whereas financial literacy has no significant impact on them. Attitude is strongly related to the behavioural intention to engage in Islamic banking services. The results also reveal that attitudes mediate the effect of Islamic values, ethical organisation, and reputation on the behavioural intention to engage in Islamic banking services, but Islamic financial literacy is not associated with customers' behavioural mindset to enjoy such services. This study provides an example of initial empirical evidence from a Muslim majority country like Bangladesh on the relationship between Islamic values, ethical organization, Islamic financial literacy, and reputation and attitudes, which in turn lead to customers' behavioural intentions to engage in services and products of Islamic banks.

TI  - Medicaid and Long-Term Care: The Effects of Penalizing Strategic Asset Transfers
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND INSURANCE
AB  - Medicaid provides a critical source of insurance for long-term care, and individuals may strategically offload assets (typically to children) to meet the means-tested eligibility requirement. In this article, we quantify the extent of such behavior using variation in the penalty for improper parent-to-child transfers induced by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. We estimate difference-in-differences models based on the hypothesis that only individuals with high levels of nursing home risk (high risk) will alter transfers because of the Act. We find that over a 2-year horizon, high-risk individuals reduced transfers to children on the extensive margin by 11 percent and that the average total amount of transfers decreased by $4,860. The results hold only for coupled respondents. We also conduct a triple-differences analysis to examine heterogeneity with financial literacy and find that even those with a low level of financial literacy responded to the penalty.

TI  - Modelling the Effects of Financial Services Advertising on Financial Product Purchase: An Empirical Validation
T2  - VISION-THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
AB  - The main aim of the study is to find the effect of the financial advertisement on the respondent's information selection, processing and analysing it while making the financial purchase decisions. The study identified the important factors that affect the investment decision-making process and explored them by using the exploratory factor analysis. The conceptual model has been tested using the AMOS SEM software. The factor analysis identified the four important factors that are affecting the financial decision-making, that is, financial literacy, celebrity endorsement, perceived reality and entertainment. The hypothesis testing reveals that advertisement, perceived reality and entertainment are affecting the information processing and financial decision-making process, whereas financial literacy and celebrity endorsement do not have significant effects on the financial product purchase. The results are useful for the advertisers, policy makers and the financial service providers so as to increase the sale of financial products by focusing on the variables extracted by the research.

TI  - What influences users' continuance intention of internet wealth management services? A perspective from network externalities and herding
T2  - ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB  - In recent years, more and more wealth management platforms have adopted Internet wealth management (IWM) services to attract users. Due to the intensive competition and low switching costs, it is essential for platforms to enhance users' willingness to continue using IWM services. Comprehensively considering the role of network externalities and herding, this study identified the factors affecting users' continuous intention of IWM service. The research model was tested using survey data collected from 637 respondents concerning their perceptions of IWM services. The results indicate that network externalities (network size, perceived complementarity, network strength) have significant impact on herding and perceived value, thus affecting continuance intention. Furthermore, herding and perceived value have a greater impact on continuance intention of users with low financial literacy than that of users with high financial literacy. This study could benefit wealth management platforms and researchers seeking to improve the retention rates of IWM users.

TI  - INVESTMENT LITERACY, RISK TOLERANCE AND MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF WORKING ADULTS IN KUALA LUMPUR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - Financial literacy empowers consumers to make more informed financial decisions, including investing in mutual funds. In this study, the sociodemographic profile of working adults with low investment literacy visa-vis high investment literacy are examined first. Next, the impact of investment literacy and risk tolerance on the likelihood of investing in mutual funds are explored. Among a sample of 260 working adults comprising mainly of Masters of Business Administration (MBA) students from a leading public higher institution in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the study shows that those with Business/Economics education backgrounds have the highest investment literacy and are more likely to invest in mutual funds compared to individuals from the Arts and other miscellaneous backgrounds. Although Muslims are the least literate in investment matters, they are more likely to hold mutual fund investments relative to those who profess Christianity and Hinduism. Individuals with relatively high income and occupational levels have relatively higher investment literacy. Risk tolerance does not influence the likelihood of investing in mutual fund investments. Policymakers should focus on females, those with Arts education background, Muslims, and those from the lower income/employment ranks to increase their investment literacy through financial education workshops. Mutual fund companies may consider embarking an aggressive knowledge sharing videos related to mutual funds via non-mainstream media such as social media to increase the penetration of mutual fund investments, among the untapped markets.

TI  - Women, the Economy and the News: Undeserved and underrepresented?
T2  - JOURNALISM STUDIES
AB  - In 2018, the news industry found itself in the headlines when it revealed the significant difference in levels of pay between the genders, with some pre-eminent financial publications having the widest pay gaps. This provided a timely opportunity to survey 65 economic, financial, and business journalists - both men and women - working for news outlets in the UK, including the BBC and the Financial Times. The survey explored the values and working practices of business, economic and financial journalists in the UK, as well as their opinions about the gender pay gap. Results show that while women, as expected, are paid less than the men and hold fewer positions of seniority, few expressed opinions about the gender pay gap. Engaging a wide audience and a lack of resources in the industry to be able to do so are the most pressing concerns for the journalists surveyed.

TI  - Social capital, financial intelligence, and entrepreneurial financial performance: evidence from the post-pandemic challenges
T2  - VENTURE CAPITAL
AB  - The convergence of social capital and financial intelligence becomes a dynamic catalyst in the realm of post-pandemic challenges, promoting entrepreneurial financial performance to unforeseen levels as businesses use networks, knowledge, and financial expertise to overcome challenges and grasp new opportunities. Hence, the study explores the factors that influence entrepreneurial financial performance of employees in Pakistan's corporate sector. Using two theoretical frameworks, Regulatory Focus Theory and Rubicon Four-Phase Action Model in Entrepreneurship, study identifies essential traits for entrepreneurship and their direct correlation with financial success. The study utilized a survey questionnaire to gather responses from 276 employees of the corporate sector involved in entrepreneurial activities. The findings suggest that financial literacy, financial risk tolerance, entrepreneurial competency, and social capital positively impact an entrepreneur's locus of control and financial intelligence. Financial literacy equips entrepreneurs with necessary skills and knowledge to manage finances effectively, identify potential financial risks, and increase profitability. Financial risk tolerance enables entrepreneurs to understand financial markets better and make sound financial decisions. Entrepreneurial competency leads to sound financial decision-making and control of financial outcomes. Social capital provides valuable resources, information, and support to improve financial decision-making skills.

TI  - Poverty and seeking bank advice: Evidence from a survey experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY
AB  - Access to banking services for the poorest individuals is key to reducing their vulnerability, but are poor people likely to seek help from bank advisors? This study tests the hypothesis that poor peoples' financial concerns affect their willingness to seek professional financial advice from banks. A survey experiment is run by performing "hard priming" (a euro2000 car repair expense) on a treatment group and "soft priming" (a euro200 expense) on a control group. Overall, hard priming triggers higher positive intention to consult a bank advisor. However, poverty sharply and negatively moderates this effect. For respondents below the poverty line, the priming effect is close to significantly negative and becomes such when restricting the sample to individuals who responded before their payday rather than after it. Hard priming also decreases poor people's self-reported trust in banks, and this variable mediates the negative effect on intention to consult a bank advisor. There is no evidence that a lack of financial literacy or actual financial distress influence the priming effects.

TI  - Financial access and economic development: the moderating role of financial consumer protection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the moderating role of financial consumer protection (FCP) in the access-development nexus. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on cross-country data on 102 countries surveyed in the World Bank Global Survey on FCP and Financial Literacy (2013). The White heteroscedasticity adjusted regressions and Two-stage least squares regressions (2SLS) are used for the estimation. Findings Interactions between FCP regulations that foster fair treatment, disclosure, dispute resolution and recourse and financial access have positive net effects on economic development. However, there is no sufficient evidence to suggest that interactions between financial access and enforcement and compliance monitoring regulations have a significant effect on economic development. Originality/value This study extends evidence in the law-finance-growth literature by providing empirical evidence on the effect of legal institution specific to the protection of retail financial consumers on the access-development nexus using a nouvel data set, the World Bank Global survey on FCP and Financial Literacy (2013).

TI  - The Value of Financial Education During Multiple Life Stages
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This study examines the timing of financial education and its impact on short-term and long-term financial behavior. We also explore the power of financial education on financial knowledge and examine the link between financial knowledge and positive financial behavior. Exposure to financial education during multiple life stages leads to a better financial outcome. Financial education taught via multiple channels, including high school, college, the workplace, and at home, is the most optimal in the long run. For those who did not attend college, being exposed to financial education in high school is significantly associated with positive financial behavior. We cite implications for all financial education advocates. Policymakers in the financial capability arena can stay abreast of the channels of financial education that produce the most fruitful economic and societal gains.

TI  - Small-Dollar Credit Lending: The Effect of Financial Burden on Personal Asset Misvaluation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Small-dollar credit lenders offer consumers quick access to cash in the form of products, such as pawn loans. The consumers who tend to use these small-dollar credit products are more likely to face financial burden and potential for default-particularly when loan-to-value ratios are high. However, the cognitive effects of financial burden can impair financial decision making. If financial literacy educators are to empower consumers, more consumer-centric evidence is necessary to determine how small-dollar credit consumers make decisions when purchasing loans. One critical decision consumers make is accepting how lenders value their assets in exchange for credit. Three lab studies assess how consumers facing financial burden value their own assets. We find that, due to cognitive constraints of financial burden, consumers can undervalue functional assets and overvalue symbolic assets. Importantly for financial literacy efforts, however, we show that framing a symbolic asset in terms of other-benefit construal helps attenuate asset overvaluation.

TI  - Curriculum of Higher Education for Fostering Economic Development in Pakistan
T2  - FWU JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - Education is deliberated comprehensively as a gadget for growing financial economy. It also offers suggestions gearing the new generations to contract with the contests of markets in the future. Deprived of a vigorous education curriculum, neither economic nor social development is conceivable in Pakistan. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the role of curriculum of higher education for fostering the economic development and find out relationship between curriculum and economic development. The subjects of this research were university students and sample of 600 university students were selected via stratified and simple random procedure. The collected data was analyzed by using descriptive statistics frequency percentage and correlation on SPSS version 28.0. The results exposed the low indications that the Pakistani curriculum is teaching the techniques of financial learning, financial intelligence to its youth. The results found that participants were incapable to capitalize and grasp businesses in the global market to revel in financial independence. Positive descriptions for educational institutes entails to update their curriculum with acquaint practical courses for youth with boosted job scenarios in the marketplace. A robust positive correlation between financial knowledge and job opportunities as an apprise in the curriculum with modern-day mandatory subjects can resulted to enhance opportunities for graduates in the job market.

TI  - Debtors at Play: Gaming Behavior and Consumer Credit Risk
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - Exploiting a unique high-frequency, individual-level database, we (1) construct individual-level, incentive-compatible proxies of impulsivity based on video gaming behavior and (2) use these proxies to evaluate predictions concerning how impulsivity shapes individuals' responses to a relaxation of credit constraints as captured by receiving a credit card. We discover that precard gaming intensity-as measured by the frequency and amount of game expenditures-is strongly and positively associated with (a) the probability of defaulting on credit card debt in the future, (b) postcard expenditures on luxury and addictive items, (c) surges in consumption spending immediately after receiving the credit card, and (d) rapid debt accumulation after obtaining the card. Differences in financial literacy, income, income variability, education, and demographics do not drive the results. The results are consistent with (1) neurological and psychological studies stressing that excessive gaming is associated with impulse control deficiencies and (2) behavioral theories stressing that impulsivity, i.e., time-inconsistent preferences for immediate gratification and ineffective strategies for avoiding myopic cues and temptations, substantially influence individual expenditure patterns and borrowing decisions when liquidity constraints are relaxed.

TI  - Set it and forget it? Financing retirement in an age of defaults
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Retirement savings abandonment is a rising concern connected to defined contribution systems and default enrollment. We use tax data on Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) to establish that for a recent cohort, 0.4% of retirement-age individuals abandoned an ag-gregate of $66 million, proxied by a failure to claim over ten years after a legal requirement to do so. Analysis of state unclaimed property databases suggests that workplace defined contribution plans are abandoned at a higher rate than IRAs. Finally, regression discontinu-ity estimates show that certain accounts created by default enrollment are at higher risk of abandonment by passive savers.Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Characteristics of the Financially Vulnerable Groups Impacted by COVID-19 and Other Factors
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Businesses have been exposed to various challenges during the global pandemic. Unfortunately, the financially vulnerable groups in society are disproportionately affected by such a difficult time. Therefore, it is important for businesses to recognise this when creating new business models for sustainable corporate management. This paper attempts to (1) identify the factors that affect individual financial vulnerability, (2) develop survey items to assess financial vulnerability and its factors and (3) provide the characteristics of financially vulnerable groups by presenting a complete set of descriptive statistics. The results can help to create more inclusive business models that are better equipped to address the challenges ahead. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted with collaboration with an NGO that provides a financial counselling service in Hong Kong. In total, 338 valid responses were collected and the data were used to characterise financially vulnerable groups in terms of (1) change in financial conditions due to COVID-19; (2) exposure to digitised financial services and related push marketing; (3) financial management ability; (4) changes in four financial behaviours and (5) financial vulnerability as measured according to the debt/service ratio. Results show that the respondents have a median debt/service ratio of 0.513, which represents an unsustainable level of debt. Around 1/4 of surveyed respondents reported that their debt/service ratio was 1 or even higher, indicating obvious difficulties in meeting financial obligations. A total of 36.7% of the respondents reported worsening financial conditions since the outbreak of COVID-19. The results presented provide a solid empirical set of data that will help future research work to examine and/or develop a heuristic financial vulnerability model that incorporates the key factors leading to it. Businesses can refer to them when creating new business models that are sustainable, able to meet corporate social responsibility goals and can achieve several targets/goals of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Heuristics in Mutual Fund Consumers' Willingness-to-Invest: An Experimental Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - This paper improves the understanding of heuristics in the choice of mutual funds. We analyze the effect of price-quality relationship and anchors as heuristics on the evaluation of the willingness-to-invest. We perform two studies with graduate students who possess a medium-high level of financial literacy in Chile. In the first study, we find that willingness-to-invest increases (decreases) when subjects observe (do not observe) in the market a positive relationship between expense ratios (price) and service quality. In the second study, in the presence of an anchor, the reference price obtained by individuals from the market information loses relevance and the anchor effect predominates. Our results confirm that participants, as consumers of financial services, apply heuristics as groundwork for their investment decisions. These heuristics as a decision making process are useful but do not always lead to the choice of the lowest cost alternative with the highest possible service quality.

TI  - Assessing the Quality of Self-Reported Financial Information
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURVEY STATISTICS AND METHODOLOGY
AB  - It is well known that self-reported financial information differs from administrative records. This article advances previous studies by using a unique matched representative sample of individual borrowers from the Chilean Household Finance Survey with administrative banking loan records. Our linked dataset allows us to test whether the differences between the two sources are due to the number of nonreported loans or to differences in the reported loan amounts. We show that discrepancies in debt ownership are larger when respondents have a mortgage and are not the highest income member of the family, when respondents have weak financial literacy and do not have confidence in the study, and when respondents live in complex or multigenerational households. However, borrowers report the maturity of their mortgage and installment loans quite accurately. Concerning loan amounts, differences between the two sources decrease with the financial literacy of the respondent. Finally, a simple form of rounding can go a long way towards explaining differences in the middle part of the debt amount and maturity distributions.

TI  - Closing the Gender Profit Gap?
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - We examine the impact of providing access to mobile savings accounts and im-proving financial management skills on the performance of microenterprises in Mozambique. The effects are highly heterogeneous: Combining both types of support is associated with a large increase in both short-and long-term firm profits and in financial security for female microentrepreneurs. This allowed female-headed microenterprises, particularly those with a higher level of profits at baseline, to close the gender profit gap in performance and skills rela-tive to their male counterparts. The main drivers of improved business performance are improved financial management practices (bookkeeping), an increase in accessible savings, and reduced transfers to friends and relatives. Providing access to mobile money as a tool to save and manage finances also increases long-term profits of female microentrepreneurs, par-ticularly for those with higher profits at baseline. However, neither treatment has any impact on male-led enterprises. Uncovering this heterogeneity in impact across different types of microenterprises can help improve the targeting of these interventions in the future.

TI  - Retail investors and financial advisors: New evidence on trust and advice taking heuristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - This paper investigates factors that influence trust and advice taking among retail investors when consulting with financial advisors and making real-world portfolio decisions. The data reveal that non-expert retail investors trust their advisors a lot. Trust formation appears to be well described by a simple heuristic that relies substantially on the advisor's communication style when deciding how much to trust and delegate investment decisions. Portfolio decisions appear to depend more on investors' perceptions about the investor-advisor relationship than on the risk and return characteristics of investments comprising the portfolio choice set. This evidence supports Pentland's (2008) "honest signals" as a more powerful mechanism underlying investor trust than standard metrics based on past performance. Trust and advice-taking heuristics can be interpreted as well adapted to the environment of the non-profit bank cooperatives in which they are observed, implying that trusting based on simple honest signals, although vulnerable to exploitation, can be interpreted as ecologically rational. Features of the investor's environment typical of non-profit cooperative banks imply that the heuristics investors use can perform rather well without requiring investment experience or financial sophistication, which most investors in our sample are well aware they lack.

TI  - GAMIFICATION AND ITS INFLUENCE ON FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT BEHAVIORS OF YOUNG INVESTORS
T2  - TRANSFORMATIONS IN BUSINESS & ECONOMICS
AB  - Exploring the intersections linking gamification and financial management among young investors in Thailand, the study focused on the attenuating impact of gamification on financial management factors -financial planning activity, financial self-efficacy, financial literacy, financial attitude, and financial culture on financial management behavior of these investors. The specific aim of the study was to examine and understand the impact of gamification on the financial management behaviors and decision-making processes of young investors with an age range from 18-40 years. A quantitative survey research design was applied, utilizing primary data collected from 332 young investors in Thailand, which were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The highlights of the results showed that financial attitude, financial culture, financial planning activity, and financial literacy positively and significantly affect the financial management behavior of young investors in Thailand. Gamification was also found to moderate the effect of all latent factors on financial management behavior significantly. In this regard, gamification should be considered sacrosanct for young investors when making investment decisions because of its aptitude to influence engagement, loyalty, attention span, and financial management behavior, which are all central to building a thriving platform.

TI  - Facilitating Informed Decision-Making in Financial Service Encounters
T2  - BUSINESS & INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB  - While advice-giving encounters form an integral part of banks' services, clients often buy inappropriate products and face financial consequences. Legislators have started to put banks under pressure to ensure that clients are properly educated. However, the literature describes barriers due to which client education is doomed to fail applying current advice-giving practices. Practicable alternatives to the predominant perfect agent style of advice-giving are dismissed, mainly with the argument of client-side cognitive limitations. This paper challenges this assumption by suggesting a decision-making process that seamlessly integrates educational interventions, thus supporting informed client decision-making. In the spirit of design science research, the authors take a fresh look at the problems of client education in cooperation with a large Swiss retail bank to derive generalizable requirements, and design a novel IT-supported advice-giving process. An evaluation demonstrates the design's utility in significantly improving client learning, compared to traditional service encounters. This research extends the current discourse on service encounter design, and seeks to help practitioners to design the financial service encounters of tomorrow.

Many of these experiments are published in top economics and finance journals. The evidence shows that financial education programs have, on average, positive causal treatment effects on financial knowledge and downstream financial behaviors. Treatment effects are economically meaningful in size, similar to those realized by educational interventions in other domains, and robust to accounting for publication bias in the literature. We also discuss the cost-effectiveness of financial education interventions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The level of self-employed individuals' financial knowledge holds implications with respect to financial stability, economic welfare, and growth of young enterprises. This study found that self-employed individuals did not differ significantly from employed workers in terms of their financial knowledge. Self-employed workers were less likely than employed workers to be engaged in financial practices that improved their long-term financial health. However, there was no difference in the level of confidence in future retirement prospects between self-employed individuals and their employed counterparts. With the ongoing erosion of social protection systems, this research provides a basis for addressing the issue of relatively poor retirement planning among self-employed workers.

Also, it identifies whether the model is invariant. The results indicate that public servants have better future expectations, financial planning, and savings behavior than other occupations. The level of financial preparation for retirement is low in all occupations. The construction of public policies that consider both the need to increase levels of planning and inequalities is essential for greater financial well-being in retirement.

TI  - Women and Wealth: Financial Propinquity to Business Success
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - Around the globe, women's income and wealth are increasing as never before. Prevailing economic, demographic, and technological changes are growing women's financial strength and independence. Be it finance, marketing, supply chain or ICT based industry, women have made incredible strides, both at professional and social fronts, particularly in the two decades. Today they are better educated, well placed and have greater accountability in the corporate world and are frontrunners in many professions. Consequently, women, particularly in developing countries like India and China have become economic powerhouses. They not only significantly contribute to GDP but also are becoming a substantial untapped market for the wealth management industry. In this context, this study is an attempt to discuss the much talked about, but less understood, issue of women's wealth management in the Indian context. The study is intended to explore financial planning awareness among working women and their attitude towards wealth management. The findings will help wealth managers and financial planners to develop a deeper understanding of female investors' goals and priorities, investment patterns of the working women and to gain insight into gender specific investment behaviour of Indian investors.

TI  - The nexus between investor sophistication and annuity insurance ownership: evidence from FINRA's National Financial Capability Study
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose Although annuitization provides insurance against longevity risk that can benefit households, researchers have uncovered an annuitization puzzle, which suggests households are reluctant to annuitize their wealth. This study contributes to the discussions on the annuitization puzzle by examining investor sophistication and owning annuities in non-retirement accounts. Design/methodology/approach The study utilizes data from the 2018 U S National Financial Capability Study (NFCS). The empirical analyses are based on logistic regression estimates of annuity ownership on investor sophistication. Interpretations are based on odds ratios. Findings The findings indicate that investor sophistication contributes to the annuity puzzle. Investors with low objective and high subjective investment knowledge (overconfident investors) are more likely to own annuities compared to those with low objective and low subjective investment knowledge. However, investors with high objective and low subjective investment knowledge (under-confident investors) are less likely to choose annuity ownership compared to those with low objective and low subjective investment knowledge. The findings and ensuing discussion highlight the importance of annuitization when planning for retirement, with implications for financial service professionals. Research limitations/implications The measure of investor sophistication does not assess the difficulty level of each financial knowledge question. The questions used to construct the investor sophistication variable are based on general investment knowledge. In addition, the annuity ownership variable used in this study pertains to investments outside retirement accounts. Despite these limitations, the findings highlight the importance of annuitization when planning for retirement. Originality/value Unlike prior studies, the authors consider four mutually exclusive measures of investor sophistication constructed from measures of objective and subjective investment knowledge to understand the effect of investor sophistication on annuity ownership in the United States.

TI  - Don't Let Them Fool You: Adolescents' Present-orientation and Inferior Financial Understanding
T2  - YOUNG
AB  - In the last 20 years, adolescents have gradually become very important clients for the banking industry. The current study investigates, using data collected in a survey, whether adolescents offered two options for investing in a saving certificate choose the financially preferable one and whether this choice is related to their time preference, after controlling for gender and bank account ownership. The participants were 270 adolescents from public high schools in Israel. The findings indicate that approximately 40 per cent made the inferior financial decision. However, those with a bank account were less likely to decide poorly, possibly indicating that having an account reduces financial illiteracy. Moreover, selecting the financially inferior choice correlates with a higher subjective discount rate (higher present-orientation). A gender effect is also found; girls have higher subjective discount rates, and this effect is stronger for girls with a bank account. Policy implications regarding financial education programmes are discussed.

TI  - Financial Knowledge and Private Health Insurance: Does Age Matter?
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - (1) Background: The paper focuses on the relationship between financial knowledge (FK) and holding private health insurance (PHI), and also focuses on the effect of age on the aforementioned relationship. (2) Method: The study was carried out on a sample of 8055 individuals taken from the 2016 Financial Competences Survey (the only one available), prepared by the Bank of Spain. Unlike previous studies that limited themselves to considering numeracy as a proxy for FK, in this study, two levels of FK-basic and advanced-are considered. (3) Results: The results indicate that a higher level of FK, specifically advanced FK, increases the probability of an individual holding PHI. Regarding age, it has been observed that the relationship between FK and PHI is only relevant in middle and older age, but not in younger and adults. Therefore, it is appropriate to differentiate between basic and advanced FK, and we confirm that age exerts a moderating effect on the influence of FK on PHI. (4) Conclusion: We conclude that FK-specifically, advanced FK for middle-aged and older people-is relevant to the likelihood of an individual holding PHI, which can improve health and financial wellbeing.

TI  - Compulsive Buying Behaviour of Credit Card Users and Affecting Factors Such as Financial Knowledge, Prestige and Retention Time: A Cross-sectional Research
T2  - VISION-THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
AB  - A leading concern in client and vender relations is that the rising new situation of influence deploying of the credit card market. This situation is accountable for compulsive buying, which has disapprovingly exaggerated consumers, leading to impossible debt levels. Financial counsellors search for why and how individuals get themselves into financial debt. Compulsive buying behaviour and credit card could have a powerful effect on consumers' financial stability. Further, in place of comprehending credit card usage and compulsive buying, this study correlates them with wealth attitudes such as power-prestige, financial knowledge and retention time. A cross-sectional descriptive research design using convenience sampling and non-probability sampling with quota samples of 313 credit cardholders was surveyed. The outcome showed that those with power-prestige money attitudes are likely to have free usage of credit cards through compulsive spending. Results also showed that those with a higher financial understanding have lower compulsive spending off the credit card.

TI  - Retirement funding adequacy in black South African townships
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - Purpose This study investigates the retirement funding adequacy of black South Africans and how it can be influenced by family structure, health status, financial literacy and the role of the financial planner. Design/methodology/approach A mixed sampling approach was applied to collect data from 441 black South Africans. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was undertaken and Cronbach's alphas were calculated to confirm the validity and reliability of the measuring instrument. Structural equation modeling was the main statistical procedure applied to test the hypothesised relationships in the research. Findings Most of the respondents reside in informal urban areas or townships. The findings show a significant positive relationship between financial literacy and the retirement funding adequacy of black individuals. The study found that individuals who are concerned about the wellness of their family, health and finances are more likely to maintain their standard of living at retirement. However, the role of the financial planner, among black South Africans, does not influence their retirement funding adequacy. Originality/value This study contributes to the limited understanding on the factors that influence the retirement funding adequacy of black South Africans and it provides recommendations on improving retirement funding adequacy.

TI  - Inclusive or Fraudulent: Digital Inclusive Finance and Urban-Rural Income Gap
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the influence of digital inclusive finance on the income levels of farmers and elucidate its operational mechanism. Using statistical data spanning from 2011 to 2020 across 281 prefecture-level cities in mainland China, our findings establish a significant positive correlation between the developmental stage of digital inclusive finance and farmers' income levels. Additionally, digital inclusive finance plays a constructive role in reducing income disparity between urban and rural areas, primarily through advancing agricultural technological innovations. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the beneficial impact of digital inclusive finance is more pronounced in regions with higher human capital and lower levels of digital development. Furthermore, we observe a mutually reinforcing relationship between traditional financial development and digital financial inclusion. While affirming the fostering of inclusive and balanced development to some extent, this paper underscores the imperative of addressing the digital divide. The favorable effects of digital inclusive finance are diminished for individuals with low human capital and limited financial literacy, highlighting the necessity of enhancing financial literacy and education among rural residents as pivotal factors for digital inclusive finance to effectively fulfill its inclusive role.

TI  - The Financial Behavior of Investment Decision Making Between Real and Financial Assets Sectors
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This research was conducted to achieve several objectives and focus research was based on financial behavior theory and prospect theory as grounded theory e.g., investigate the financial decision-making behavior between financial and real assets investment, and confirm the relationship existing between herding behavior and overconfidence factors to the level of loss and regret aversion, and financial literacy into real assets investment decisions. The study used 220 real estate auction respondents as investor samples at the State Assets and Auction Service Office Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Data was collected through the use of a questionnaire consisting of 23 questions to measure the variables. Moreover, the research data passed through several feasibility tests like the inner and outer modeling by Partial Least Square - Structural equation model (PLS-SEM) while the hypotheses formulated were also tested to determine the magnitude of the variable relationship. Through the use of the direct and intervening test, loss and regret aversion variables have a positive and significant effect while financial literacy variables have no significant effect. There is a slight difference in the decision-making process for real assets and financial assets investors. Investment decision making behavior in the financial assets sector requires less complicated decisions compared to the decisions related to real assets investments.

TI  - Financial Literation Analysis, Marketing Strategies, and Institutional Models of Coffee Farming Creation
T2  - QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB  - Coffee is one of Indonesia's leading commodities that has opportunities in the domestic and international markets. Processed coffee drinks are now increasingly favored by people from various circles, so that the growth of national coffee consumption continues to increase. However, the fate of coffee farmers is not directly proportional to the trend of increasing Indonesian people's coffee consumption. The purpose of this study was to analyze financial literacy and coffee marketing strategies as well as the institutional model of coffee farming in Jember Regency, especially cooperative of KSU Ketakasi. The research methodology used is explanatory research. This study was carried out at some stages: field studies/surveys (to uncover and unravel the problems of coffee farming), analysis of marketing strategy, and analysis of business institutional models. The research results showed that; (a) the level of financial literacy in accessing financing sources is still very low; (b) the mudharaba and musyarakah financing scheme is more appropriate for KSU Ketakasi to finance coffee farmers; and (c) KSU Ketakasi has implemented a marketing mix consisting of product, promotion, price, and location. In addition, KSU Ketakasi has established a cooperative to accommodate the harvest of coffee from farmers and sell it to buyers. Although the institutional body is still simple, KSU Ketakasi has been able to contribute to Jember Regency in the form of foreign exchange for the local government.

TI  - Financial Knowledge and Short-Term and Long-Term Financial Behaviors of Millennials in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - This study investigates the role of financial knowledge in various short-term and long-term financial behaviors among Millennials in the United States. Results from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) indicate that Millennials have lower levels of objective financial knowledge and similar levels of perceived financial knowledge as compared to all households. Consistent multivariate results find financial knowledge to be positively associated with performing positive short-term and long-term financial behaviors. Results are found to be robust across different measurements of financial knowledge and behavior, and the issue of the potential for reverse causality is specifically addressed. This study provides a comprehensive financial profile of Millennials with important insight for policymakers as well as financial practitioners.

TI  - Socio-Economic and Demographic Determinants of Financial Inclusion in Underdeveloped Regions: A Case Study in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between financial inclusion and socio-economic and demographic factors. Ownership of bank accounts, availing of credit facility, and use of mobile banking were considered the major indicators of financial inclusion. To achieved this objective, the present study was conducted in the rural regions of three hill districts of Uttarakhand. 780 rural households were selected by using stratified and judgment sampling technique. To measure the association between the variables, binary logistic regression model was employed. The findings of the study revealed that there is a significant association of socio-economic variables with financial inclusion. The overall analysis of the study indicates that the likelihood of having bank account, usage of mobile banking facility, and availing credit facility increases with the increase in the financial literacy of an individual in hill rural regions of the state. Further, the study also indicates the vulnerability of women relative to that of men in both cases of mobile usage and availing credit. The findings of the study suggest to target the economically vulnerable section of population (as identified in case of having low financial inclusion) and enhancing the financial literacy in these regions.

TI  - Do People Understand the Benefit of Diversification?
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - Diversification-investing in imperfectly correlated assets-reduces volatility without sacrificing expected returns. Although the expected return of a diversified portfolio is the weighted average return of its constituent parts, the variance of the portfolio is less than the weighted average variance of its constituent parts. Our results suggest that very few people have correct statistical intuitions about the effects of diversification. The average person in our data sees no benefit of diversification in terms of reducing portfolio volatility. Many people, especially those low in financial literacy, believe diversification actually increases the volatility of a portfolio. These people seem to believe that the unpredictability of individual assets compounds when aggregated together. Additionally, most people believe diversification increases the expected return of a portfolio. Many of these people correctly link diversification with the concept of risk reduction but seem to understand risk reduction to mean greater returns on average. We show that these beliefs can lead people to construct investment portfolios that mismatch investors' risk preferences. Furthermore, these beliefs may help explain why many investors are underdiversified.

TI  - Promoting Islamic financial ecosystem to improve halal industry performance in Indonesia: a demand and supply analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to identify and explore the role of Islamic financing in supporting development of halal industry in Indonesia.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This research is divided into two studies. The first study uses survey-based quantitative method and the second study uses focus group discussion (FGD) method. Using a purposive and proportional sampling technique in the first study, this research collected 1,985 samples of Islamic financial products of business owners (demand-side) from all parts of Indonesia. The data were analyzed using the partial least square structural equation modeling approach. The authors also conducted FGDs, involving 35 participants from government, financial, social and education institutions (supply-side) as well as business owners (demand-side) in three separated times.
   Findings
   In the first study, it can be identified that literacy on Islamic finance, attitude and awareness strongly affect business owners' intention to use Islamic financial products. It is also found that subjective norm significantly influences literacy, attitude and awareness. Interestingly, religiosity does not significantly affect attitude toward Islamic financial products. According to the FGD in the second study, this research generates several factors motivating business owners' preference to choose conventional rather than Islamic financial products, including expensive pricing, less developed technology, bad service quality and the halal status of the products. The reason for insignificant results of religiosity on attitude in the first study is explained in the second study. Most users are utilitarians who mainly perceived the products based on the sought benefits provided by the products.
   Practical implications
   This research offers the government a road map showing the strategy to build Islamic financial ecosystem in Indonesia. The road map integrates supply-side, which includes government, financial industries, social and education institutions and scientific organizations, and demand-side, which includes business owners or entrepreneur associations.
   Originality/value
   This research provides a wide range of samples derived from business owners' respondents of halal industry in all representative islands in Indonesia. Therefore, it gives more holistic and representative findings. In addition, the analysis in this research covers not only the demand-side but also the supply-side perspective. Lastly, this research provides an Islamic financial ecosystem model that integrates all stakeholders to improve halal industry performance as a whole.

TI  - Activating Consumers for Better Service Coproduction Outcomes Through Eustress: The Interplay of Firm-Assigned Workload, Service Literacy, and Organizational Support
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING
AB  - Companies are allocating increasing coproduction workloads to consumers. Ironically, many consumers may be ill-equipped to coproduce, as indicated by widespread low service literacy (e.g., financial literacy, medical literacy). This research examines how consumers, particularly those low in service literacy, respond to varying levels of firm-assigned coproduction workload. Five studies, including a hospital field experiment, reveal three findings. First, service literacy plays a moderating role, such that higher (vs. lower) levels of coproduction workload improve service outcomes (e.g., compliance intentions), particularly for consumers with low service literacy. Second, coproduction eustress is a crucial mediator, such that positive service outcomes result from consumers appraising coproduction tasks as positive and meaningful challenges. In turn, eustress is elicited by consumers' belief that they are collaborating with the provider to achieve a shared goal. Third, offering organizational support to consumers might mitigate the beneficial effects of coproduction eustress because it can trigger reactance. This research can help policy makers and managers in finding new ways to activate consumers, particularly those low in service literacy, as coproducers for better service outcomes.

TI  - Does Financial Behavior Influence Financial Well-being?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - Financial behavior and financial well-being are two closely related aspects of an individual's financial decision making. This study attempts to investigate the extent to which financial behavior influences financial well-being in the Indian scenario. The data is collected using a structured questionnaire from a sample of 150 respondents. The study employs Financial Management Behaviour Scale (FMBS) (Dew & Xiao, 2012) to measure financial behavior. Factor analysis and multiple regression are performed to find the influence of financial behavior on financial well-being. The findings of the study suggest that except for credit commitment all the other behavioral factors like future security, savings and investments, credit indiscipline, and financial consciousness have a significant impact on the financial well-being of an individual in the Indian scenario. The regression coefficients of financial well-being are strongly determined by financial consciousness. The study is a contribution to the existing behavioral studies literature and the model used identifies the factors that influence the financial well-being in the Indian scenario. The study is conducted during the year 2020, so the results could have been influenced by the economic scenario of the period. The results of the study can be used by financial advisors to understand the financial well-being in the Indian scenario.

TI  - When entrepreneurship meets finance and accounting: (non-)financial information exchange between venture capital investors, business angels, incubators, accelerators, and start-ups
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING
AB  - Building on qualitative data from 53 interviews with different types of investors and start-ups, we study the financial and non-financial information that different investor types demand to monitor their portfolio start-ups' performance during different lifecycle stages, as well as how entrepreneurs generate and furnish the required information. We specifically show in detail how investors, like venture capitalists, incubators, or business angels, mitigate agency conflicts through the exchange of specific financial and non-financial information, both formally and informally. By directly comparing both investor and investee cases, we provide insight into the monitoring methods common among different investor types and start-ups. While investors consider accounting to be an important part of the relationship, some entrepreneurs do not or set their priorities differently. Our study illustrates that accounting not only plays a crucial role in the management of established businesses, but is equally important in entrepreneurial investment settings, as is financial literacy.

TI  - Combining teaching methods and developing students' entrepreneurial skills and entrepreneurial intention: The case of students in the Faculty of Economics and Management of Tunis
T2  - INDUSTRY AND HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - This paper analyzes the effects of the combination of two teaching methods on entrepreneurial intention in Tunisia. The developed model suggests that entrepreneurial intention depends on eight cognitive and non-cognitive variables; namely, financial literacy and entrepreneurial knowledge developed through a theoretically-oriented course, and teaching methods, creativity, managing ambiguity, entrepreneurial mindset, entrepreneurial attitude and core self-evaluation developed through a practically-oriented course. The authors use structural equation modeling to test the proposed model, based on a sample of 92 undergraduate management students in the Faculty of Economics and Management of Tunis, Tunisia. The results demonstrate that creativity is a good predictor of students' entrepreneurial intention. Creativity can be developed by entrepreneurial teachers who enhance students' ambiguity management and improve their core self-evaluation. The results also show that financial literacy positively influences entrepreneurial knowledge and managing ambiguity. Entrepreneurial knowledge positively influences entrepreneurial mindset and core self-evaluation. The management students' entrepreneurial mindset positively influences their entrepreneurial attitude, which develops their core self-evaluation. Because the respondents were all studying at the same faculty, the results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to broaden the field of investigation and to include in their studies students from other institutions.

TI  - Bibliometric analysis of global research trends on microfinance institutions and microfinance: Suggesting new research agendas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS
AB  - Poverty alleviation is a global problem. To alleviate poverty, microfinancing is used through microfinance institutions. There are many publications comprising empirical and literature review articles beside others focusing on this issue. Subjectivity bias is one of the issues that is seen in the literature reviews in an area of interest. This study answers the problem based on the bibliometric analysis of microfinance, micro-finance institutions, micro-insurance, micro-savings, and financial inclusion with other synonyms using the Scopus Database. This article focuses on overall historical trends, publication output, prolific authors and journals, google mapping of the world-renowned academic institutions, and highlights the shortcoming of the Scopus database by utilizing software for the first time. We use VOSviewer, for co-authorship analysis and our results underline the leading role of United States contribution to a greater extent, while co-citation analysis shows emerging hotspots such as financial technology including fintech, crowdfunding, and financial literacy. We concluded limited attention from scholars towards natural-resource revenues, financial development using fintech, and crowdfunding regarding poverty alleviation. Furthermore, for the interest of the development researchers and practitioners, we have highlighted the conceptual framework for financial development, natural resource abundance, economic growth nexus through fintech, crowdfunding, financial literacy to curb poverty as new avenues for future research agenda.

TI  - The Impact of Digital Financial Inclusion and Bank Competition on Bank Stability in Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - ECONOMIES
AB  - The last few years have witnessed a rapid development in digital finance that may threaten the manner in which traditional financial services are being used. It opens up new opportunities for low-income groups and small businesses that have limited or no access to formal financial services. Thus, digital financial inclusion plays a vital role in boosting a country's financial inclusion, fulfilling some sustainable development goals and achieving higher economic growth. This study builds on a new measure of digital financial inclusion to examine the impact of digital financial inclusion and bank competition on bank stability in Sub-Saharan Africa for the period 2014 to 2020 using the two-step System Generalised Method of Moments. An index of digital financial inclusion, z-score, Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), and non-performing loans were used as data variables. The study findings reveal that digital financial inclusion has a significant positive relationship with bank stability (z-score) and a negative relationship with non-performing loans. The study also found a significant negative effect of bank competition (HHI) on bank stability in line with the competition-fragility view. Policymakers should ensure digital financial literacy for all since it feeds into bank stability and also reduces bank insolvency. They should also find ways of enhancing bank competition which reduces non-performing loans and bank insolvency. On practical implications, the study calls for strategic measures to preserve bank stability, such as complementing digital financial inclusion with financial literacy and enhancing bank competition.

TI  - A systematic review of investment confidence, risk appetite and dependence status of women
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Numerous studies worldwide have explored the intriguing realm of women investors, scrutinising their investment confidence, risk appetite, and financial dependence. In this compelling exploration, the study embarks on a journey with two distinct objectives. The first was to identify the factors that affect the investment confidence, risk appetite and dependence status of women while making investment decisions in the family. Another objective was to examine whether the changes in demographics like Age, Education, Employment Status, Annual Income, Nature of Workplace, etc., change the investment confidence, risk appetite, and dependence status of women. The article immerses the reader in the rich tapestry of literature, unearthing insights that have shaped the understanding of the unique investment behaviours of women. The research journey includes the collection of responses through a structured questionnaire. The population of this study was women hailing from diverse corners of the Delhi-NCR Region in India, spanning an age range from 18 to 65 years. A Purposive sampling method led to a dataset of 500 participants eager to share their perspectives. ANOVA and Welch tests were used along with the Post hoc analysis using the Tuckey HSD method and Games Howell Method to identify the significant differences in the categories of independent variables. The culmination of this study reveals an exciting revelation: the dynamic interplay of age, education, employment status, annual income, and workplace environment significantly alters the investment confidence, risk appetite, and financial autonomy of women, marking a testament to the fascinating evolution of women in the world of finance.

TI  - The rise of digital finance: Financial inclusion or debt trap?
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - This study focuses on the impact of digital finance on households. While digital finance has brought financial inclusion, it has also increased the risk of households falling into a debt trap. We provide evidence that supports this notion and explain the channel through which digital finance increases the likelihood of financial distress. Our results show that the widespread use of digital finance increases credit market participation. The broadened access to credit markets increases household consumption by changing the marginal propensity to consume. However, the easier access to credit markets also increases the risk of households falling into a debt trap.

TI  - Exploring Determinants of Desirable Financial Behaviors Using Decision Tree Analysis Evidence From Four Waves of National Financial Capability Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - The purpose of this article is to utilize decision tree (DT) analysis to examine the relationship between income level, financial satisfaction, financial confidence, financial knowledge, and several demographics with a goal of better understanding desirable financial behavior. The emphasis of this analysis is focused particularly upon better understanding the role of financial knowledge in desirable behavior outcomes. DT analysis is most useful when an analysis includes numerous variables and solving problems where the cumulative learning process is inherent. Our DT analysis of four FINRA National Financial Capability datasets (2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018) suggest that financial knowledge is a relevant variable only under specific circumstances and for respondents with relatively higher income levels. Key variables in the DT analysis included income level and financial satisfaction.

TI  - Workplace Financial Education and Change in Financial Knowledge: A Quasi-Experimental Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This exploratory study employed quasi-experimental research methods to investigate the relationship between adult participation in a comprehensive workplace financial education program and changes in financial knowledge levels. Results revealed a positive association between participation in the education program and changes in financial knowledge levels, even when controlling for demographic and socioeconomic differences between the participant and non-participant groups. However, results did not support an association between perfect attendance in the program and changes in financial knowledge. Evidence from this study provides meaningful insight into the association between adult financial education and financial knowledge and offers guidance for the future development of effective comprehensive workplace financial education programs.

TI  - Audit committees, corporate governance, and shareholder wealth: Evidence from Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND PUBLIC POLICY
AB  - This paper examines the effect of audit committee appointments on shareholder wealth in Korea after the Asian financial crisis. We find that stock prices generally increase with audit committee appointments. In contrast, chaebol (business group) affiliates and firms switching audit committee membership are associated with significantly lower stock returns, probably due to the management's opportunistic behavior. However, the independence and financial literacy of the audit committee members appear to mitigate the opportunistic behavior. Therefore, our result confirms that the characteristics of the audit committee strengthen or weaken the existing corporate governance. We discuss the implications of our results obtained under Korea's unique corporate governance structure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Top managers' attributes, innovation, and the participation in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: A study of energy sector small and medium-sized enterprises
T2  - MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS
AB  - A large number of researchers are engaged in studying the determinants and consequences of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Although optimism abounds, in particular, few empirical evidence is available for Pakistani businessmen and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) operators on how to benefit from this tremendous opportunity. Our study examined how top managers/owners of Pakistani energy sector SMEs can innovate their businesses to reap the benefits of CPEC. We have examined the influence of demographic factors (age, education, experience, and financial literacy) of top managers/owners on different forms of innovation (product, process, marketing, and organization) and their consequent chances of success through participation in CPEC.

TI  - What Determines Consumer Financial Distress? Place- and Person-Based Factors
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - We use credit report data to study consumer financial distress in America. We report large, persistent disparities in financial distress across regions. To understand these patterns, we conduct a "movers" analysis. For collections and default, there is only weak convergence following a move, suggesting these types of distress are not primarily caused by place-based factors (e.g., local economic conditions and state laws) but instead reflect person-based characteristics (e.g., financial literacy and risk preferences). In contrast, for personal bankruptcy, we find a sizable place-based effect, which is consistent with anecdotal evidence on how local legal factors influence personal bankruptcy.

TI  - Does childhood adversity affect household portfolio decisions? Evidence from the Chinese Great Famine
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - We employ the 1959-1961 Chinese Great Famine as a quasi-natural experiment to examine the relationship between experiencing adversity in childhood and financial decisions in adulthood. Using data from the 2017 China Household Finance Survey and the intensity of excess deaths during the Great Famine, results from our preferred two-part fractional regression model suggest that, for an additional excess death per thousand people during the Famine, cohorts who were in their infancy and early childhood during the Famine are 0.2-0.3 percentage points less likely to hold risky financial assets than other cohorts. We also find that, conditional on the decision to hold risky assets, those who experienced an additional excess death per thousand people during the Famine in their middle to late childhood hold 1.1 percentage points higher share of risky assets in their household financial portfolios than those who did not experience the Famine. We explore several potential mechanisms and find that financial literacy, risk-taking preferences and locus of control are channels through which childhood adversity in the famine years affects household portfolio decisions. Our findings are robust to a series of sensitivity checks.

TI  - WHAT SITUATIONS CAUSE CRUCIAL FINANCIAL DECISIONS WITHIN SOCIAL BUSINESSES?
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - The growing uncertainty in today's business environment has a significant influence on social business's behaviour. Those enterprises could rely on public support in the past, but nowadays, they have to find a way to be more responsible about their social activity and be financially independent on public resources. Based on this theoretical background, the paper's main goal was to find a set of factors that influence crucial financial decisions within a crisis. When social businesses create an optimal financial portfolio to be financially sustainable, primary research was conducted. A sample of 57 social businesses was asked about their financial strategy. The main research goal was to compare a change before and after the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic situation in 2020. This case has shown current financial thinking and preparedness for unusual or crises. A mixed research approach was chosen due to a limited number of respondents. The overall results found that those businesses prefer to use the current strategy (42%) in crisis, and they limit investments to survive in that situation, except marketing investments (16%).
   Implications for Central European audience: At the theoretical level, our study shows social enterprise concepts in the Central European context, which differs somewhat from the already established definition of mainly Anglo-Saxon and American authors. At the same time, it combines knowledge about the use of financial planning in this segment. The study results show that financial planning is essential in these companies because it can achieve social goals. A discussion would be opened on how to raise awareness of the preparation of the strategy. Alternatively, how to strengthen the financial literacy of managers or representatives of these entities.

TI  - How Does Population Aging Impact Household Financial Asset Investment?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The accelerated aging of China's population will inevitably increase the burden of social retirement and significantly impact the development of financial markets, which is not conducive to sustainable social development. A proper allocation of financial assets will enable households to earn more property income and facilitate the appropriate allocation of social capital. The aging of the population is an essential factor affecting the allocation of financial assets to households. This paper examines the impact of an aging population on household financial asset allocation based on data from the 2015, 2017, and 2019 China Household Finance Surveys (CHFS). The study finds that aging significantly negatively affects household risky financial asset participation, depth of participation, and diversity. The findings remain robust after robustness tests using a two-way fixed effects model. In addition, this paper examines the mechanisms of influence from the perspectives of both risk aversion and financial literacy. In terms of mediating variables, aging increases the risk aversion of household heads, and an increase in risk aversion discourages households from investing in risky financial assets. In terms of moderating variables, the dampening effect of aging on investment in risky financial assets diminishes as financial literacy increases. In addition, empirical findings based on heterogeneity find that aging has a stronger negative impact on risky financial asset participation, depth of participation, and diversity in rural areas. Aging has a stronger negative impact on risky financial asset participation for households with children.

TI  - Determinants of Public Investment Decision in Forex Robots Trading: Evidence from Indonesia
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING
AB  - Manuscript type : Research paper Research aims : This study aims to analyse the factors that influence investment decisions on forex trading robot users in Indonesia by using four factors that influence investment decisions: financial literacy, investment knowledge, financial behaviour, and risk tolerance. Design/Methodology/Approach : The method used in this research is quantitative with a survey approach. The data analysis technique used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) through the Partial Least Square (PLS) approach. The data collection technique was carried out by distributing questionnaires with a Google form on the WA Forex robot trading user group. In the end, 200 users filled out the questionnaire. Research findings : This study shows that financial literacy and investment knowledge significantly influence public decisions. Meanwhile, financial behaviour and risk tolerance do not significantly affect people's investment decisions in forex robot trading. This shows that forex trading robot users have good financial literacy and investment knowledge in deciding to invest. However, trading robot users have financial behaviour that tends to be wrong, so they are tempted to profit that is promised by 10-60 percent every month by forex trading robot companies without paying attention to the risk tolerance of the amount of property they invest. As a result, if the return from investment encounters obstacles, forex trading robot users will experience financial difficulties. Theoretical contribution/Originality : This study provides information that can help potential investors be careful and understand the risks when investing using forex trading robots. Research on investment decisions on forex trading robots in Indonesia is the first research that has been conducted due to the proliferation of companies offering forex trading robots that have led to Scams or Ponzi Schemes so that investors are harmed. Practitioner/Policy implication : The government of the Republic of Indonesia is to immediately pass the Law on the Use of Trading Robots in Indonesia so that it becomes the basis for the legality of trading using robots. Meanwhile, for the investment community using trading robots, even though trading robots promise large profits, they have weaknesses that allow the public to experience financial losses. Research limitations/Implications : Future research can consider the UTAUT model in measuring investment decisions in trading robots in Indonesia. Research regarding trading robots needs to be carried out continuously as public literacy material to avoid investment models that end in Ponzi schemes-also using a legal approach to be able to explain the criteria for trading robot providers that are close to or by the legislation in Indonesia which is currently being drafted.

TI  - Pension Freedom Day in the United Kingdom: Early evaluation of consumer response
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Understanding decumulation decisions in retirement is an important component of public policy that influences pension regulations in aging societies. This research examined a recent, substantial change to pension regulation in the United Kingdom: the newly established flexibility to obtain a lump-sum payout from personal or occupational pension savings. Conducting an online survey of individual's eligible to take advantage of the Pension Freedom regulation, we find that almost half of study participants plan to obtain a lump-sum payout, on average 33,741 pound, intending it for an average of three different investments or purchases. The decision to obtain a lump-sum withdrawal was related to better knowledge of the new regulation. It was also more likely among older respondents and those not worried about a decline in standard of living during retirement. Dispositional measures did not affect the lump-sum decision. Close to one-third of study participants still planned to invest retirement savings into an annuity, especially those who retire at a later age, have concerns about care costs and worry about decline in standard of living in retirement. Comments about the changes to pension regulation were slightly more positive than negative. From our analysis of the effect of the Pension Freedom regulation on savings decumulation decisions, we conclude that the new Pension Freedom regulations do meet consumer demands, and demonstrate that pension knowledge and retirement expectations, in particular, influence consumer evaluations. We further conclude that annuity investments continue to play a role for older adults in the United Kingdom, especially for those concerned about meeting financial needs during retirement.

TI  - Systematic mistakes in the mortgage market and lack of financial sophistication
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Institutions often offer a menu of contracts to consumers in an attempt to create a separating equilibrium that reveals borrower types and provides better pricing. We test the effectiveness of a specific set of contracts in the mortgage market: mortgage points. Points allow borrowers to exchange an upfront amount for a decrease in the mortgage rate. We document that, on average, points takers lose about $700. Also, points takers are less financially savvy (less educated, older), and they make mistakes on other dimensions (e.g., inefficiently refinancing their mortgages). Overall, our results show that borrowers overestimate how long they will stay with the mortgage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - We surveyed 854 current and 147 former members of self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) in 2016. The results of our survey document their aspirations, operational practices and experiences. Both current and former members expressed high general interest in superannuation, but 'detractors' of SMSFs outnumbered 'promoters'. SMSF members said they enjoy 'control' of investment, but a majority delegated tasks to financial professionals. Three times as many members rated the performance of their fund as above the SMSF average as below, although most did not measure the performance of their fund adequately. The probability of closing a SMSF is significantly higher if members use net returns, rather than other indicators such as account balance, to judge performance. JEL Classification:H55, H75, J32

T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We study the diversification and welfare effects of a large US robo-advisor on the portfolios of previously self -directed investors and document five facts. First, robo-advice reshapes portfolios by increasing indexing and reducing home bias, number of assets held, and fees. Second, these portfolio changes contribute to higher Sharpe ratios. Third, those who benefit most from robo-advice are investors who did not have high exposure to equities or indexing and had poorer diversification levels. Fourth, robo-advice decreases the time investors dedicate to managing their investments. Fifth, those investors who benefit most are more likely to join the service and not quit it.

TI  - Sustainable Investment Attitudes Based on Sustainable Finance Literacy and Perceived Environmental Impact
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The aim of this study is to examine whether sustainable finance literacy and the perceived environmental impact of sustainable finance instruments exert substantial influence over the sustainable investment attitudes of investors within the developing country setting of Ankara, Turkiye. Following a systematic literature review, an online survey was designed and conducted. Multivariate regression models were used for the analysis. The findings illustrate that individuals with a greater level of sustainable finance literacy and a positive perception of the favorable environmental effects of sustainable finance instruments tend to exhibit a positive investment stance and are more likely to invest in sustainable finance instruments. Among the questions related to sustainable finance literacy, the most significant factor in explaining sustainable investment attitude is the knowledge of how sustainable finance instruments can be utilized for risk diversification. In addition, it is depicted that individuals with higher income levels exhibit a favorable disposition toward sustainable finance instruments. The results of our study imply that, to stimulate sustainable investments in developing countries, regulatory authorities and sustainable fund issuers such as financial corporations can enhance promotional campaigns and workshops aimed at increasing awareness and understanding of sustainable finance literacy, sustainable financial instruments, and their positive impact on the environment.

TI  - Discipline, risk, and the endogeneity between financial decisionmaking and health
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB  - We examine the effect of financial asset allocation and asset liquidity on individuals' health. Earlier literature finds empirical evidence and provides theoretical justification of the impact of health on financial decisions but speculates that reverse causality is unlikely. Through panel data methods and an instrumental variable approach, we refute this claim and establish a causal effect of financial choices on physical and mental health outcomes. Our findings suggest that accounting for endogeneity changes the results from a basic specification. Stock holdings no longer significantly affect health while ownership of time accounts and retirement accounts have a strong positive effect on health outcomes. An exploration of the channels driving these effects provides confidence that the potential stress caused by the risk level of financial assets as categorized by the literature is not the primary driver of health outcomes. However, the findings support the time preference channel, i.e. willingness to forego financial satisfactions today in return for greater financial well-being in the future causes beneficial physical and mental health outcomes. There is also some support for the allostatic load hypothesis as well as a dopamine substitutability hypothesis.

TI  - Financial services in China: Why not choose joint-stock commercial banks?
T2  - MANAGERIAL AND DECISION ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper examines the influence of households' choice of banks on financial service usage in China. Our results show that choosing joint-stock commercial banks could significantly increase household usage of financial services. Moreover, the positive effect of choosing joint-stock commercial banks on household usage of financial services is more pronounced for rural and high-income households. In addition, we find that the financial literacy and risk tolerance of the household head can expand the positive effect of choosing joint-stock commercial banks on household financial service usage.

TI  - Does self-control constitute a driver of millennials' financial behaviors and attitudes?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Millennials are currently facing particular financial challenges that will condition the future financial well-being of the society as a whole, and the decision-making process happening in worse circumstances than those of preceding generations. However, few studies to date have deeply analyzed millennials' financial behaviors, and particularly, how self-control operationalizes their financial choices. Using data from the 2017 Survey of Financial Competences of Spanish individuals, this paper analyzes how self-control influences different financial behaviors and attitudes and whether this effect differs between millennials and older generations. The results indicate that self-control does influence the individuals' financial attitudes regardless of generation, whereas in the case of financial behaviors, only those millennials exhibiting the highest levels of self-control are affected by it when deciding on a saving account or a personal loan. These outcomes have numerous significant implications, in addition to providing recommendations to policy makers aimed at engaging millennials in healthier financial behaviors.

TI  - The influence of retirement goals and risk attitudes on Malaysian women's retirement planning
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - The lack of retirement savings for the future lives of many individuals, and pre-retirees in particular, is an example of one of the most critical problems facing many emerging countries. Unfortunately, a lack of preparedness can have severe effects on Malaysian cultures, especially for women who are nearing retirement. The issues persist and, most likely, are becoming worse despite all the awareness campaigns that have been running for a while. In order to express fresh thoughts and suggest an extra approach or workable solution to supplement past research and conclusions, this study will analyse this dilemma from a women's perspective of retirement planning. This study applies a quantitative approach, where primary data was acquired through online surveys of 443 workers in various locations in Malaysia. Validation of the measurement model in this study uses the structural equation model (SEM), which interprets that if the model fits, the strength of path estimates, validity, and reliability of the construct are estimated. The results of this study show that retirement goals affect an individual's retirement planning, but risk perception does not affect an individual's perspective on planning for a future retirement. This study also emphasises the significance of financial literacy in retirement planning, specifically how it will boost the confidence of these female workers as they approach retirement. These findings also have useful ramifications for financial planners and advisors, enabling them to better comprehend the variables influencing retirement saving behaviour.

TI  - Entrepreneurial Aspirations and Challenges among Business Students: A Qualitative Study
T2  - ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on small businesses, significantly influencing entrepreneurial aspirations and presenting numerous challenges. This calls for additional research into perceptions, intentions, and the challenges faced in this context. This study aims to explore the comprehension of key entrepreneurial concepts among business students in the post-pandemic era. The paper presents an empirical study which employs qualitative in-depth interviews with 34 undergraduate business students from one public university in the Midwest of the United States. The findings reveal a complex view of entrepreneurship that extends beyond traditional business creation, encompassing elements of social innovation and personal fulfillment. Students displayed a generally positive attitude towards entrepreneurship, influenced strongly by their involvement in practical entrepreneurship-related activities and their familial backgrounds. However, they also identified significant barriers, including financial constraints, fear of failure, and a lack of practical experience, which hinder their intentions to pursue entrepreneurial ventures. The study underscores the importance of entrepreneurship education programs incorporating more comprehensive practical experiences, enhancing financial literacy, and providing psychological support to overcome these challenges. These insights contribute to the ongoing discussion on how to effectively support and prepare aspiring entrepreneurs in a changing educational landscape.

TI  - Student loan debt and financial education: a qualitative analysis of resident perceptions and implications for resident well-being
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE
AB  - High educational debt is prevalent among resident physicians and correlates with adverse well-being outcomes, including symptoms of stress and burnout. Residents also report low financial literacy levels, affecting financial well-being. Understanding resident viewpoints toward financial well-being initiatives is crucial to develop targeted resident financial well-being programs. This study aims to examine residents' experiences financing their medical education and how these experiences influence well-being and attitudes toward financial education in residency. We recruited residents from a Southern California health system with residency programs in Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery, and Psychiatry. We contacted residents by email and text message to participate in semi-structured interviews. We conducted interviews from October 2020 to March 2021 and analyzed 59 resident interviews using reflexive thematic analysis. Among residents, 76% (45/59) had >= $200,000 in student loans. Residents perceived mounting medical education debt as unfairly burdensome for trainees engaged in socially beneficial work, leaving residents feeling undervalued - a feeling heightened by the stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic - and hampering well-being. Compartmentalizing debt attenuated financial stressors but often made financial education seem less pressing. A subset of residents described how financial planning restored some agency and enhanced well-being, noting that protected didactic time for financial education was crucial. Resident interviews provide practical guidance regarding designing financial education sessions. Desired education included managing debt, retirement planning, and the business of medicine. How residents framed educational debt and their degree of financial literacy impacted their well-being and sense of agency. Residents proposed that residency programs can aid in stress mitigation by providing residents with skills to help manage debt and plan for retirement. To reduce clinician indebtedness, this approach needs to occur in tandem with systemic changes to financing medical education.

TI  - CASH FLOW TRAINING AND IMPROVED MICROFINANCE OUTCOMES
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Despite its promise as a powerful tool for alleviating poverty, research suggests that microfinance has had only a modest impact on development. Misallocation of funds by clients has been implicated as a major impediment to microfinance success. In this study, clients received training on how to track (but not manage) their cash flows during the first two meetings of the microfinance loan cycle. Examination of weekly cash flow shows that clients immediately invested the majority of their funds into the businesses and carefully managed revenues and expenditures to maintain sufficient food and other household expenditures throughout the loan cycle. It is not possible to know whether this behaviour occurred as a result of monitoring cash flow because clients who do not keep cash flow records do not have a reliable way to report expenditures. However, exit interviews provide evidence that cash flow tracking enhanced financial performance and control. When asked whether tracking cash flows affected their understanding and behaviour, half or more of the subjects responded that tracking their cash flow helped them to understand the importance of investing in the business, identify unnecessary expenditures and/or develop a better understanding of their revenues, expenses and profit. By investing a small amount of time in helping clients track cash flows, lenders can empower clients and potentially improve both the repayment and productive benefits of the loans they make.

TI  - Inclusive Islamic financial planning: a conceptual framework
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework of inclusive Islamic financial planning (IFP) by combining the traditional Islamic institutions of zakat and awqaf with contemporary notions of financial planning, financial inclusion and financial literacy that caters to the short-term and long-term financial goals of the poor.
   Design/methodology/approach - Being a conceptual article, an inclusive IFP framework is described, analyzed and developed by integrating modern notions of financial inclusion, financial planning and financial literacy with the concepts of zakat and awqaf.
   Findings - Using the notion of a hierarchy of needs and a financial planning model, an inclusive IFP framework that can be used by the poor is outlined. The complementary role of the non-poor households who provide funds for zakat and awqaf is also identified.
   Research limitations/implications - The applicability of an inclusive IFP would require Islamic financial instruments and products, institutional development and existence of a social planner who can integrate zakat, awqaf and financial planning to serve the financial needs of the poor.
   Social implications - Application of an inclusive IFP that can mitigate poverty would necessitate integrating financial planning skills and knowledge with traditional institutions of zakat and awqaf to provide holistic financial advice and services to the poor households.
   Originality/value - Discussion of financial planning in financial inclusion literature is scant. The paper explores and offers a novel approach of poverty mitigation by utilizing the full spectrum of IFP that considers the financial needs and allows for the creation of a personalized financial plan for low-income households.

TI  - Investigating the self-employed: the South African perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - PurposeIn a country that is marred by an excessively high unemployment rate, there is a need for policymakers to prioritise entrepreneurship in South Africa. The study aims to explore the determinants of self-employment among the youth in South Africa and in the process answer the following question: Who are the self-employed youths in South Africa? Design/methodology/approachDifferent potential predictors of self-employment empirically used in the literature were used in this study. A probit regression model was used with the binary self-employment variable as the dependent variable and a host of independent variables. A nationally representative survey consisting of youths was used in the analysis. FindingsThe findings show that financial literacy increases the odds of being self-employed. Secondly, the odds of being self-employed increase with age as mature people are expected to have gathered enough networks and wisdom over the years. Thirdly, being male decreases the odds of being self-employed. When it comes to education, the only category that statistically increases the odds of being self-employed compared with no schooling is the tertiary level of education. The other educational levels are all statistically insignificant. From a policy perspective, the government should promote self-employment by investing in financial literacy as well as increasing access to tertiary education among disadvantaged groups. Originality/valueThe study is one of the first, to the best of the authors' knowledge, to examine the characteristics of the self-employed using a nationally representative survey in South Africa.

TI  - Mataram mosques management: intention to place mosque funds in Islamic banks
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to examine idle funds in mosques in Mataram City and analyze the intentions of the mosque chairman to place mosque funds in Sharia banks. Six variables are used to analyze the intention; attitudes, subjective norms, behavioral control, sharia financial literacy, sharia banking knowledge and the responsibility of the management for the trust of the society.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research consists of two studies; descriptive research examining idle funds of mosques and correlational research analyzing the intentions of mosque directors to place mosque funds in Sharia banks. Intentions will be analyzed using the theory of planned behavior approach, developed through the PLS-SEM method, and the data obtained from questionnaires through surveys were processed using the SmartPLS 3 application.
   Findings - This study found that the average surplus between income and expenditure reaches IDR2.7m monthly. Also, 75% of mosques have placed their funds in Islamic banks. This study shows a positive relationship between the level of Islamic financial literacy, knowledge of Islamic banking, responsibility for public trust, attitudes toward Islamic banking, subjective norms and behavioral control in influencing the intentions to place mosque funds in Islamic banks. However, only behavioral control is accepted as it significantly influences intentions. Behavioral control means that to maximize intentions, Islamic banks need to make it easier for mosque administrators to place funds.
   Originality/value - This research signifies a pioneering effort in examining idle funds within mosques, particularly those equipped with comprehensive financial reports within Mataram City. Furthermore, it spearheads an inquiry into the intentions of mosques to channel their funds into Sharia banks, underpinned by rigorous quantitative methodologies.

TI  - Exploring the impact of socio-demographic characteristics on financial inclusion: empirical evidence from Tunisia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose This paper aim to fill the gaps by looking for the determinants and barriers related to financial inclusion. This study assesses the effect of socio-demographic variables on the use of formal financial inclusion services. Design/methodology/approach This article examines the barriers to formal financial inclusion, focusing on saving and credit strands. The authors propose the probit model, allowing distinguishing the outcome variable into three categories: Formal inclusion, informal inclusion and financial exclusion. The authors apply this model to the Findex 2017 survey data. Findings Estimation results propose that the trust to financial institutions, the distance to banks, the lack of documentation and the service costs are the main barriers, but these barriers affect the probability of using formal financial services differently according to the types of financial services (saving or credit). Research limitations/implications To advance the formal financial inclusion in Tunisia, the authors call for continuing promoting financial literacy among adults and the young population, which helps them understand the benefits of using formal financial services. Financial literacy throws in constructing the individual trust toward the financial sector in a country that experienced several decades of political and economic instability. Originality/value Financial inclusion promotes growth through a broadening of the system and technology that can be a major catalyst for greater financial inclusion. It helps in the overall economic development of the underprivileged population and contributes to poverty reduction. It can also enhance the security of payments, and thus lower the incidence of associated crime.

TI  - Very good farmers, not particularly good business-people: A rural financial counsellor perspective on rural business failure
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Capitalising on the food and fibre opportunities of a burgeoning global population requires a high performing and resilient agribusiness sector. Necessarily, this includes a business focus to identify opportunities and implement strategies to ensure the delivery of food and fibre products demanded by the global marketplace while managing impacts of a dynamic operating environment. Current agriculture policy in Australia recognises the varying capacity of rural businesses to thrive in this environment and provides both indirect and direct welfare support. One example is the provision of a publicly funded financial counselling service to rural business in financial stress. This research has used interpretive description to better understand the drivers of the financial hardship experienced by businesses accessing the Rural Financial Counselling Service (RFCS). Guided interviews were conducted with 32 Rural financial Counsellors (RFC) who had at least five years experience in the role. Thematic analysis of the interviews highlighted the social, environmental and financial complexities impacting the successful operations of a rural business. The key finding of this research is that despite the myriad influences impacting businesses in this cohort, business failure reflected a lack of business skills, which could be aggregated under the umbrella terminology of business acumen. These skills are more nuanced than simply poor financial literacy, extending to the manner in which business operators understand the fundamentals of their business environment and are able to intervene to maximise the opportunities and mitigate the threats. Consequently, decision-makers focussed on production preferentially to the business of capitalising on that production. The research identified opportunities for research relating to the challenge of enhancing the business acumen of rural business decision-makers, as well as illuminating the business and social context of gender in rural business sustainability.

TI  - Predicting loss aversion behavior with machine-learning methods
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - This paper proposes to forecast an important cognitive phenomenon called the Loss Aversion Bias via Hybrid Machine Learning Models. One of the unique aspects of this study is using the reaction time (milliseconds), psychological factors (self-confidence scale, Beck's hopelessness scale, loss-aversion), and personality traits (financial literacy scales, socio-demographic features) as features in classification and regression methods. We found that Random Forest was superior to other algorithms, and when the positive spread ratio (between gain and loss) converged to default loss aversion level, decision-makers minimize their decision duration while gambling, we named this phenomenon as "irresistible impulse of gambling".

AB  - This paper investigates how religious beliefs affect urban household stock market participation in China. We use the China Household Finance Survey in 2013 to show that religious beliefs inhibit total stock market participation and its increment. Such a negative effect is significant only for Buddhists and Protestants in China. We provide a new explanation from the perspective of ex-pected utility maximization. Specifically, religious activities crowd out the time spent on improving financial literacy and lower the commercial insurance expenses that reduce risks in an individual's current life. Our results hold after considering the potential endogeneity problem and various robustness tests.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - Many development interventions involve training of beneficiaries, based on the assumption that knowledge and skills will spread 'automatically' among a wider target population. However, diffusion of knowledge or innovations can be slow and incomplete. We use a randomised field experiment in Uganda to assess the impact of providing incentives for knowledge diffusion, and pay trained individuals a fee if they share knowledge obtained during a financial literacy training. Our main results are that incentives increase knowledge sharing, and that it may be cost-effective to provide such incentives. We also document an absence of assortative matching in the social learning process.

T2  - ACTA UNIVERSITATIS SAPIENTIAE-FILM AND MEDIA STUDIES
AB  - The article shows the way must-see film lists hosted by financial publications positivize, after the 2008 crisis, the message of feature and documentary films representing finance. Here positivization refers to the detouring or softening of the critical edge of the message of a film in the interests of the hosting website and the profession of finance in general. Emphasis falls on financial literacy and on a film's artistic prestige and entertainment potential. The author argues that positivization is a semantic strategy indicative of a neoliberal business ontology that informs the interpretation of cultural artifacts. It instrumentalizes signification processes in order to foreground exchange value and present film reception as an investment in human capital.

Extending existing financial literacy definitions, this paper shifts the perspective from measuring financial resilience components to exploring the drivers that could impact that resilience at an individual level. This bridging of the objective and subjective domains contributes to the common good by exploring how citizens deal with daily decision-making in a financialised world.

T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - This paper investigates the effect of economic policy uncertainty on the consumption response to household debt using household-level data from China. Our results suggest that there is a positive relationship between household debt and consumption. However, a higher level of economic policy uncertainty not only weakens this positive relationship but also inhibits the effect of household debt on the consumption structure. In addition, the negative impacts of policy uncertainty are stronger among households that are more liquidity constrained, whose heads have lower cognitive abilities and financial literacy, and that are located in provinces with lower levels of digital financial inclusion.

TI  - Findings from the Polish InsurTech market as a roadmap for regulators
T2  - COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB  - The dynamic development of modern technologies has changed the rules of the game in the financial market, including the insurance sector. While introducing digital business models may bring certain advantages for insurers, there is a widespread expectation of consumers to manage their financial affairs anytime and anywhere. This article sets out by demonstrating recent phenomena on the insurance market arising from its digitalisation, i. e., automation, personalisation, insurance on-demand, machine learning & artificial intelligence, Big Data, concluding distance contracts; along with the threats to consumer safety they pose a cyber risk that may materialise at different stages of the digital insurance selling process. Further, to provide insights into how modern digital insurance markets work, the article presents the results of a study conducted by the authors on a representative sample of 2,136 respondents from Poland. The study allows one to identify certain behaviour patterns of customers in their dealings with providers of insurance products and services as well as their approach to technological innovations introduced by the traders. Crucially, the study shows that insurance consumers have a positive attitude towards the use of modern technologies in insurance, however, their knowledge on this subject is still limited. Specifically, insurance consumers tend to be more afraid of cyber risks than any legal risks resulting from deploying new technologies in the insurance sector. In conclusion, the article maps out key regulatory challenges related to ensuring consumer protection on digital insurance markets.

TI  - Followers of the pied piper of pensioners
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS-REVUE CANADIENNE D ECONOMIQUE
AB  - Using survey and administrative data, we study followers of H & L, a massively popular Chilean pension advisor, establishing that financial literacy is not a panacea for poor retirement decision-making. We detail the dynamics of who followed H & L and why. H & L differentially drew financially sophisticated investors, and exposure to H & L causally increased financial sophistication. Nonetheless, followers earned mean annual returns below all buy-and-hold strategies and were aware of this underperformance. Moreover, performance did not materially affect renewal rates. Most followers renew, citing high returns, loss minimization and trust as reasons for following. We show followers gained information about financial matters that had clear, tangible value, and they acted on this information. We posit that followers attributed this to H & L's skill, thus continuing to follow despite the underperformance.
   Les adeptes du joueur de flute des retraites. A l'aide de donnees d'enquete et de donnees administratives, nous etudions les adeptes de Felices y Forrados (FyF, qui signifie en francais & DLANGBRAC; heureux et plein aux as & drangbrac;), une societe de conseil en retraite chilienne tres populaire, et etablissons que la culture financiere n'est pas une panacee contre les mauvaises decisions en matiere de retraite. Nous decrivons en detail la dynamique des personnes qui ont suivi FyF et les raisons pour lesquelles elles l'ont fait. FyF a attire de facon differentielle des investisseurs financierement sophistiques, et l'exposition a FyF a causalement augmente la sophistication financiere. Neanmoins, les adeptes ont obtenu des rendements annuels moyens inferieurs a toutes les strategies d'achat a long terme et etaient conscients de ce sous-rendement. En outre, le rendement n'a pas eu d'incidence notable sur les taux de renouvellement. La plupart des adeptes ont renouvele leur adhesion en invoquant des rendements eleves, des pertes minimes et la confiance comme raisons. Nous montrons que les adeptes ont obtenu des renseignements sur les questions financieres qui avaient une valeur claire et tangible et qu'ils ont agi en fonction de ces renseignements. Nous supposons que les adeptes ont attribue ce resultat a la competence de FyF, et ont donc continue de suivre ses conseils malgre le sous-rendement.

TI  - Market discipline in the behavioral finance perspective: a case of Sharia mutual funds in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose This study aims to determine antecedents of market discipline. A model was constructed by extending the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to explore the cognitive, psychological and social factors that influence the market discipline in the form of withdrawal behavior. Design/methodology/approach This study applied a quantitative approach by surveying 181 Indonesian retail investors in Sharia mutual funds, which were represented by civil servants. The samples were collected using the purposive sampling technique. This study used the partial least square-structural equation model to analyze the data. Findings The results revealed that the Islamic financial literacy, the attitudes toward withdrawal, the subjective norms and the perceived behavioral control had a positive significant effect on the withdrawal intention, whereas financial risk tolerance had an insignificant impact. Then, all the exogenous variables and intention to withdraw had a significant contribution in explaining market discipline. Contrary to the proposed hypothesis, the attitude toward withdrawal had a negative impact on market discipline. The structural model indicated that the TPB could be extended by adding some exogenous variables (i.e. Islamic financial literacy and financial risk tolerance) in determining the intention to withdraw and withdrawal behavior, which indicated the market discipline in Sharia mutual funds. Research limitations/implications This study was limited to individual investors who work as civil servants. This study did not accommodate different demographic factors such as age and gender, which influence fund withdrawal behavior. Practical implications The government must focus on the inclusion of market discipline in Sharia mutual funds' regulation to encourage the risk management disclosure, specifically that related to Sharia compliance. Originality/value Previous studies applied a traditional finance theory to predict market discipline, but this study contributes to filling the theoretical gap by explaining the market discipline from a behavioral finance perspective that was found in Sharia mutual funds.

TI  - Bank customers complaints, financial knowledge and gender
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING-REVISTA ESPANOLA DE FINANCIACION Y CONTABILIDAD
AB  - This work aims to analyse the relationship between financial knowledge and the propensity of consumers to complain in the event of disagreement with a financial institution. A sample of 8,286 individuals from the Survey of Financial Competencies elaborated by the Bank of Spain is analysed. The results reveal that individuals with greater financial knowledge show a greater propensity to complain, presumably due to their heightened ability to detect possible fraud or abusive practices by financial entities. Gender itself is not relevant in the propensity to complain. However, when the sample is divided by gender, financial knowledge is more relevant for women than men. Additionally, the results reveal that in the female sample, propensity to complain is affected by self-confidence, in contrast to the male sample. The results suggest that the authorities should take practical steps to include financial knowledge in the educational curriculum.

TI  - Epistemic Virtues Versus Ethical Values in the Financial Services Sector
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB  - In his important recent book, Ethics and the Global Financial Crisis: Why Incompetence is Worse than Greed (2015), Boudewijn de Bruin argues that a key element of the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 was a failure of epistemic (i.e. knowledge-based) virtue. To improve matters, then, de Bruin argues we need to focus on the acquisition and exercise of epistemic virtues, rather than to focus on a more ethical culture for banking per se. Whilst this is an interesting suggestion and it is indeed very plausible that an increased focus on proper knowledge-related behaviour will be part of a solution, we are sceptical both about de Bruin's overarching theoretical claims and about his practical suggestions for change. Instead we argue that change in this sector is best promoted by reconceiving of the relationship between financial institutions and the societies they serve, and that this is fundamentally not an epistemic but a moral issue.

T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study explores the impact of digitalization, literation, and innovation on the financial performance of Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) in Bojonegoro, East Java, Indonesia. Using a sample of 35 business owners, the research employs partial least squares structural equations modelling. The findings reveal a positive and significant relationship between innovation and MSMEs' financial performance, emphasizing the crucial role of innovative practices. Additionally, business owners' literacy levels positively influence innovation. Although digitalization shows a positive impact on innovation and financial performance, the lack of statistical significance calls for nuanced exploration. The study contributes to understanding the complex dynamics within MSMEs post-pandemic, emphasizing the importance of literation and innovation. The research offers practical insights for MSME owners on enhancing financial literacy and fostering an innovative culture within their businesses. Policymakers were also encouraged to allocate resources to facilitate financial training for business owners. Urban areas might employ varying pandemic response strategies depending on their economic circumstances, resulting in differences in interaction variables. Future studies should extend these findings to diverse urban settings to broaden our understanding of literation, innovation, and digitalization's impact on MSME performance.

TI  - Impact of Gender, Age, and Education of Peer-to-Peer Lender on Loan Viability Assessment: Evidence from Sharia Firm
T2  - INDONESIAN CAPITAL MARKET REVIEW
AB  - Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending offers investors the discretion to allocate funds based on their risk tolerance. However, funds cannot be withdrawn until loans mature or are repaid by borrowers, rendering it a relatively high-risk investment. Research suggests that women in older age groups tend to exhibit greater risk aversion, though financial literacy may mitigate gender disparities. This study employs logistic regression to analyze the impact of gender, age, and education on P2P loan viability assessment. Our findings indicate that, generally, older lenders are less likely to finance high-risk loans. However, older women with at least a bachelor's degree display behaviors that contradict this theory.

TI  - Do sociodemographic factors have influence on risk tolerance level of stock market investors? An analysis from a developing country perspective
T2  - SOUTH ASIAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS STUDIES
AB  - Purpose The study attempts to assess the relationship between sociodemographic factors and the risk tolerance level of stock market investors reflected by their trading behavior from the perspective of developing market economy. Design/methodology/approach The study collected data from a survey on capital market investors in Bangladesh. Portfolio beta has been used as a dependent variable to measure the risk tolerance level where total 11 sociodemographic factors have been used as independent variables. Findings Among all study variables, three sociodemographic factors are found to be significant in differentiating the risk tolerance level of the stock market investors. The author finds that the risk tolerance level of stock market investors significantly varies according to marital status, family size and financial responsibility. Practical implications As sociodemographic characteristics provide a basis in assessing the investor risk tolerance level in the context of developing market economies, the study suggests that stock market related policy and investment management planning process should be formulated by incorporating behavioral aspects of the retail investors. Originality/value This study has the potential to contribute to the behavioral finance literature by showing how and at what extent sociodemographic factors may influence the risk tolerance level of stock market investors in developing countries, where sociodemographic factors are considered to be more dominating than the normative portfolio selection procedure because of lacking in investors' financial literacy and due to the presence of a weak regulatory as well as institutional framework. Further, apart from identifying and comprehensively incorporating all possible sociodemographic factors, this study uses portfolio beta as a new objective measure for financial risk tolerance, which overcomes the problem of subjective and other risk tolerance measurement in the existing literature.

AB  - Early life exposure to local financial institutions increases household financial inclusion and leads to long-term improvements in consumer credit outcomes. We identify the effect of local financial markets using Congressional legislation that led to unintended differences in financial market development across Native American reservations. Individuals from financially underdeveloped reservations enter consumer credit markets later, and upon reaching adulthood, have ten point lower credit scores and four percentage point more delinquent accounts. These effects are long-lived and depreciate slowly after individuals move to more developed areas. Formative exposures to local banking improve consumer credit behavior by increasing financial literacy and financial trust. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Retirement Confidence: Development of an Index
T2  - INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING
AB  - Older workers who are confident about the changes accompanying retirement report higher well-being. We have developed an index to measure retirement confidence - the Retirement Confidence Index (RCI). A six-stage approach was used to develop the index items, including (i) a literature review to catalogue retirement confidence components; (ii) a consultation with a panel of experts to review the proposed indicators and combine components according to their meaning; (iii) normalisation of the selected components to make them comparable; (iv) weighting of the top-level dimensions using experts' judgement; (v) linear aggregation of the dimension scores according to their corresponding relative weight; and (vi) correlation of the composite score with a self-report measure of retirement confidence. Based on the review of the literature, a list of nine sub-components (financial literacy, financial attitude and behaviour, financial control, financial anxiety, physical health, mental health, social connectedness, goal setting for retirement and future uncertainties) was compiled. Subsequently, these components were grouped into four broad dimensions. Correlations between these dimensions (social, financial awareness and skills, health and well-being, and retirement awareness and planning dimensions) and the corresponding self-reported measures were as high as r = 0.555, r = 0.603, r = 0.591 and r = 0.569, reflecting 30.8%, 36.3%, 34.9% and 32.3% shared variance with the corresponding self-reported indices, respectively. The Retirement Confidence Index provides the foundation for future research to measure retirement confidence, with the aim of identifying deficient RCI dimensions and directing efforts to targeted policies to ensure older workers are confident about retirement.

AB  - We introduce a risk-reduction-based procedure to identify a subset of funds with a resulting opportunity set that is at least as good as the original menu when short-sales are imposed. Relying on Wald tests for mean-variance spanning, we show that the better results for the subset can be explained by a higher concentration of covariance entries between its assets, ultimately leading to smaller Frobenius norms of the associated matrices. With data on US-defined contribution plans, where participants have limited financial literacy, tend to be overwhelmed and prefer to make decisions among fewer choices, we obtain a 75% average reduction.

TI  - Financial Planning Ability, Risk Perception and Household Portfolio Choice
T2  - EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
AB  - Using data from the 2014 China Family Panel Studies survey (CFPS), we investigate the effects of financial planning ability and risk perception on household portfolio choice. Our findings show that households with greater financial planning ability are more likely to invest in financial markets and hold a larger proportion of risky financial assets. The empirical results suggest that a higher level of risk perception leads to more market participation and risky assets holding. Compared with the insignificant effect of financial literacy, we find that financial planning ability significantly affects household investment earnings, and high financial planning ability tends to contribute to a positive investment return.

TI  - Evaluating Deliberative Competence: A Simple Method with an Application to Financial Choice
T2  - AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - We examine methods for evaluating interventions designed to improve decision-making quality when people misunderstand the consequences of their choices. In an experiment involving financial education, conventional outcome metrics ( financial literacy and directional behavioral responses) imply that two interventions are equally beneficial even though only one reduces the average severity of errors. We trace these failures to violations of the assumptions embedded in the conventional metrics. We propose a simple, intui-tive, and broadly applicable outcome metric that properly differen-tiates between the interventions, and is robustly interpretable as a measure of welfare loss from misunderstanding consequences even when additional biases distort choices.

On a sample of 300 families from the Muzaffarpur district of Bihar, logistic regression verified gender, education level, and PMJDY accounts significantly influence multidimensional poverty. Low education, particularly in women, was observed to increase the likelihood of multidimensional poverty, while PMJDY accounts users were less poor than non-PMJDY account users in the district. Financial literacy was identified as a crucial factor which must be given due consideration. Clarifying misconceptions about government programmes, including women in financial inclusion, and connecting people to PMJDY were keys to making this programme successful.

AB  - Financial literacy and cognitive capabilities are convincingly linked to the quality of financial decision-making. Yet, there is little evidence that education intended to improve financial decision-making is successful. Using plausibly exogenous variation in exposure to state-mandated personal finance and mathematics high school courses, affecting millions of students, this paper answers the question "Can high school graduation requirements impact financial outcomes?" The answer is yes, although not via traditional personal finance courses, which we find have no effect on financial outcomes. Instead, we find additional mathematics training leads to greater financial market participation, investment income, and better credit management, including fewer foreclosures.

TI  - Microcredit and Metaphors in Subsistence Markets
T2  - JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING
AB  - This study investigates metaphors used in the marketplace when providing microcredit to micro and small enterprises (MSEs). Metaphors are associations between abstract concepts and tangible things, wherein the former is understood and even experienced in terms of the latter. This study culls metaphors from interviews with managers of microfinance institutions (MFIs) and their MSE customers and shows widespread use of metaphors by both groups. Three metaphoric themes emerged during the interviews: (1) love and war; (2) freedom and servitude; and (3) life and death. The widespread use of metaphors provides strong implications for communication in subsistence markets. Specifically, MFIs should intentionally use metaphors to compensate for MSEs' lack of business and financial literacy. The prevalence of metaphors in MFI-MSE conversations also suggests possibilities for consumer education in subsistence markets, thus contributing to research on macromarketing.

AB  - The main obstacles to migrant workers starting businesses when they return to their hometowns are their own lack of financial literacy and aptitude, a lack of sufficient venture capital, and inadequate financing options. This paper conducts an analysis of the opportunities and challenges under the rural revitalization environment in conjunction with the Internet of Things Technology, through which a migrant labor entrepreneurship analysis platform is built. Data crawling technology is applied to capture internet data resources related to innovative entrepreneurship in the data collection module, and the entrepreneurship data is processed by the Internet of Things Technology. Based on the research, the approach suggested in this paper has its benefits for analyzing the opportunities and difficulties that migrant workers encounter in a rural revitalization context, in order to finally provide some theoretical support for pertinent research.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - This paper examines the impact of entrepreneurship on the efficiency of household financial portfolios by constructing Sharpe ratios and Sortino ratios of seven kinds of financial assets, based on data from the 2013, 2015 and 2017 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), in conjunction with the returns of the financial asset index of China from 2010 to 2018. Employing CRE regressions, Heckman two-stage models and PSM methods, we find that undertaking entrepreneurship helps to increase the efficiency of household portfolios significantly. This study also verifies that entrepreneurial households improve their portfolio efficiency through financial information by testing the moderating effects of social network, business experience and financial literacy. In addition, this study shows that entrepreneurial households generally adopt a less diversified strategy in asset allocation than do non-entrepreneurial households.

TI  - Gender income gap in rural informal micro-enterprises: an unconditional quantile decomposition approach in the handloom industry
T2  - EURASIAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Based on primary data, the present study analyzes the gender income gap and its compositions throughout the income distribution of the handloom micro-entrepreneurs in Assam. The unconditional quantile decomposition reveals the existence of substantial gender income gaps along the income distribution. The differences in the productive characteristics explain much of the gap at the median and beyond. The endowment effects of education, financial literacy, risk attitude, SHGs membership, and technology adoption are found in favor of the male micro-entrepreneurs. The results suggest that the extent of risk aversion towards producing high-valued dress materials and poor management of entrepreneurial activities of the females have widened gender gap, particularly at the upper quantiles of the income distribution.

Informed by a systematic literature review of studies published in the past two decades, from 2000 to 2020, this research unveils six overarching themes: contextual conditions, technological skills and financial literacy, consistent trust, shaping financial behavior, energizing economic activities, and supporting financial inclusion. Further analysis categorizes these themes into what constitutes the two intertwined dimensions of DFS: foundational conditions and effectual repercussions. We discuss how these dimensions enhance our understanding of the role information and communication technologies play in contributing to human development. We also present practical implications for different stakeholders in the financial sector.

TI  - Business of Medicine: Developing Leaders in Academic Medicine and Learning Health Systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE LEADERSHIP
AB  - Purpose: To develop healthcare professionals as clinical leaders in academic medicine and learning health system; and uncover organizational barriers, as well as pathways and practices to facilitate career growth and professional fulfillment. Methods: The Department of Medicine strategic plan efforts prompted the development of a business of medicine program informed by a needs assessment and realignment between academic departments and the healthcare system. The business of medicine leadership program launched in 2017. This descriptive case study presents its 5th year evaluation. Competencies were included from the Physician MBA program and from specific departmental needs and goals. Results: The program hosted a total of 102 clinical faculty. We had a 37% response rate of those retained at Indiana University School of Medicine. Overall, responses conveyed a positive experience in the course. Over 80% of participants felt that they gained skills in professional reflection, professional socialization, goal orientation, critical thinking, and commitment to profession. Financial literacy was overwhelmingly the skill that was reported to be the most valuable. Finance and accounting were mentioned as the most difficult concepts to understand. Familiar concepts included communication, LEAN, and wellness related topics. One hundred percent of participants said they are utilizing the skills gained in this program in their current role and that they would recommend the course to others. Conclusion: Business of medicine courses are more common now with programs describing elements informed by health system operations. However, few programs incorporate aspects of wellness, equity, diversity, inclusion, and health equity. Our program makes the case for multiple ways to develop inclusive leaders through a focused five-month program. It also recognizes that to really impact the learning health system, health professionals need leadership development and leaders suited to work alongside career administrators, all aiming towards a common goal of equitable patient -centered care.

TI  - Simplifying the complex: 10-K readability and asset structure*
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study explores the relationship between corporate asset intensity and the readability of 10-K forms within the U.S. lodging industry over the period 1994-2020. Using OLS regressions, the study reveals that as a company's asset intensity decreases, so does the readability of its 10-K form. Additionally, we show that this relationship has become more pronounced since 1998 and is stronger for larger companies or those in the hotel industry. These results suggest that, in light of ongoing discussions and policies surrounding the readability of financial statements, companies produce more comprehensible documentation when their business operations are less specialized. This finding indicates that companies that need to address a more diverse investor base try to be as understandable as possible. This should also lead to social implications in terms of enhanced transparency, improved financial literacy, investor confidence, and a positive impact on corporate responsibility for stakeholders.

TI  - Primary school enrolment rate, completion rate and gender balancing in Nigeria; the financial inclusion perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The bedrock of growth in education is at the primary/basic education level, hence there is need to ensure that the populace not only enrolls but complete their education as well as maintain gender balancing. Financial inclusion is essential in achieving financial development which if properly tailored should result in economic growth and development. Education is an important development parameter, therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess if financial inclusiveness enhances primary school enrolment, completion and gender balancing. Design/methodology/approach In order to ascertain if financial inclusion (financial penetration, access and usage) enhances primary school education (primary school enrolment and completion) and gender balancing (primary school female-to-male ratio), the study employed the vector error correction modeling (VECM) to capture both short- and long-run dynamics of cointegration equations and also, ascertain how the long-run deviations are deemed corrected in the short run. Findings The findings of financial inclusion showed a significant positive effect on primary school enrollment but regarding primary school completion rate and female-to-male ratio, the responses to financial inclusion measures showed a completely negative effect. From the foregoing, it is not just sufficient to enroll school children but that they complete their basic primary education, and equally ensure that the males are not favored over the females so as to achieve gender balance literacy in the country. Originality/value The study focuses on how financial inclusion engenders admission, graduation and gender balancing in primary school education as the bedrock to formal education in Nigeria.

TI  - From Security to Freedom- The Meaning of Financial Well-being Changes with Age
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - Financial well-being is becoming more prominent in policy, research, and the financial sector. However, there is a lack of understanding of its meaning, and the vast majority of financial well-being research employs quantitative methods whereas recent literature reviews advocate for qualitative studies into the meaning of financial well-being and its associations with age. We contribute to that by conducting exploratory qualitative research into the phenomenon of perceived financial well-being and its components. It is based on three studies each of which used in-depth semi-structured interviews (N = 47). The first key finding is that youth perceive financial well-being to be comprised of three components: keeping the current lifestyle and making ends meet; achieving desired lifestyle; and achieving financial freedom. In contrast, older groups distinguish only two: keeping and achieving the lifestyle in the present and in the future. The second finding is that the definition of financial freedom differs across age groups. Young people aspire to become financially independent, while middle-aged individuals prioritize supporting their children, and older people are afraid of becoming a financial burden. Third, regardless of age, many do not plan, save or invest for securing their financial well-being. We conclude by proposing implications for increasing financial well-being in different age groups, and suggesting paths for further investigation.

TI  - Determinants of perceived and actual knowledge of commission paid by contributors in the pension funds industry
T2  - BRQ-BUSINESS RESEARCH QUARTERLY
AB  - This paper examines the determinants of perceived and actual knowledge of commission paid by contributors in the Chilean pension funds industry. Results show that price consciousness and brand credibility are positively associated with perceived and actual knowledge of commission paid by pension fund contributors. Results also show that financial literacy is only positively associated with actual knowledge of commission paid by contributors. Additionally, results show that price based advertising exposure is only positively associated with perceived knowledge of commission paid by contributors. This association is stronger for contributors with a high use of the price-quality cue. Based on the findings presented, implications for managers, regulators and researchers are drawn.

TI  - Who is internationally diversified? Evidence from the 401(k) plans of 296 firms
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Drawing on a novel database of the 401(k) plans of 296 firms, we examine the international equity allocations of 3.8 million individuals over the 2005-2011 period. We find enormous cross-individual variation, ranging from zero to more than 75%, and strong cohort effects, with younger cohorts investing more internationally than older ones and each cohort investing more internationally over time. Access to financial advice, lower fees, and more international fund choices are associated with higher international allocations, suggesting a role for plan design and policy. Education, financial literacy, and the fraction of foreign-born population in the ZIP code also have positive effects on international diversification, consistent with explanations based on familiarity bias and information barriers.

TI  - Financial inclusion in Turkey: unpacking the provincial inequality and its determinants
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - This paper investigates the regional disparity of financial inclusion (FI) and its determinants in Turkey from 2004 to 2020. To this end, we first construct an FI index using the principal component analysis. Then, based on the club convergence approach, we test the existence of convergence to show regional disparities in FI. Finally, we examine the main determinants of provincial disparity using ordered logit models. The convergence results strongly reject the full-panel convergence, indicating a regional disparity in FI. Furthermore, our analyses reveal that financial inclusion positively correlates with population, income, and income inequality, while unemployment hinders inclusion. Overall, our results imply that policies focusing on digital financial services, increasing financial literacy, and reducing unemployment should significantly diminish regional disparities and improve FI.

TI  - How Does Consumers' Financial Vulnerability Relate to Positive and Negative Financial Outcomes? The Mediating Role of Individual Psychological Characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Vulnerable consumers are at particular risk of financial detriment due to, for example, low financial literacy or numeracy, high debt, low income, or impactful changes in personal circumstances. We introduce a comprehensive and formative measure of financial vulnerability that integrates these risk factors and is grounded in definitions of vulnerability fromfinancial regulation bodies and government agencies such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Across three studies of US individuals, we assess the nomological validity of this measure of financial vulnerability through its relationship with positive and negative financial outcomes (e.g., savings levels, paying credit card balances in full each month, being in arrears) as well as relevant psychological characteristics (e.g., personal savings orientation [PSO], money management skills, financial self-efficacy). Moreover, we examine whether and how these psychological characteristics mediate the relationship between financial vulnerability and financial outcomes. We conclude with an overview of implications for policy makers and business practitioners.

TI  - Bids for speed: An empirical study of investment strategy automation in a peer-to-business lending platform
T2  - DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
AB  - We investigate how introducing a bidding agent impacts the process and outcome of an online reverse auction in the context of a crowdlending platform. We consider this issue in the context of a peer-to-business platform that connects individual lenders to small and medium-sized enterprises. Using a before/after study design, we perform an econometric analysis and find that introducing a bidding agent had a positive and dramatic impact on the number of bids and bidders and reduced the time necessary to collect the funds. For projects with lower ratings, it also positively impacted the number of lenders and indirectly enhanced portfolio diversification. We find that after the bidding agent was introduced, well-rated projects benefited from lower interest rates, the magnitude of the change depending positively on their rating. These results provide evidence that the bidding agent generates savings in the screening and bidding costs incurred by lenders and benefits both sides of the platform. Our contribution documents the role of bidding agent as a strategic tool to enhance financial inter-mediation. It also sheds light on how two types of decision support systems (rating-based and bidding agent) interact and shows that this interaction is of crucial importance with respect to the financial regulation of platforms if the crowd has low financial literacy.

TI  - Equity illusions
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAW ECONOMICS & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Although equity-compensation grants for rank-and-file employees are common in startups and are considered an ingrained part of their business culture, little is known about how employees approach this form of compensation. We begin filling this gap by examining employees' financial literacy regarding equity compensation and their willingness to forgo cash compensation for startup equity. Using a survey and a combination of natural language processing and machine learning techniques with conventional regression modeling, we find that employees commonly respond to economically irrelevant signals and misinterpret other important signals. The findings suggest that employees harbor a range of "market illusions" regarding startup equity that can lead to inefficiencies in the labor market, which sophisticated employers can legally exploit. The results raise questions about the protection of employees in their investor capacity in a market where highly sophisticated repeat players, such as venture capital investors, interact with unorganized and uninformed retail investors.

TI  - Fortifying the financial and environmental capital banks in commercially grazed rangelands
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
AB  - Commercial rangeland livestock producers manage a perpetual conflict. They must ensure that the financial and environmental elements of rangeland grazing remain concurrently robust, with neither borrowing excessively from the other. Successfully managing this financial and environmental tension requires sound financial literacy as it applies to pastoralism, an above-average knowledge of rangeland ecology, and intellectual and practical management skills. Achieving these competencies is the starting point for a truly sustainable rangeland grazing business. The degree to which these competencies are achieved is largely under the control of the people who manage the business. However, there are significant external influences that can impede progress towards better financial and environmental outcomes. In this paper, we draw upon more than 50 years of combined professional experience to present our definitions for financial and environmental sustainability, as they pertain to northern Australian grazing enterprises. We summarise what is currently known about the financial and environmental performance of the northern Australian beef industry, and highlight some of the current external factors that are potentially antagonistic to achieving sustainable livestock production. We conclude with a protocol that our most successful clients have used to achieve (and demonstrate) financial and environmental sustainability.

TI  - The Impact of Educational Pairing and Urban Residency on Household Financial Investments in Urban China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - With China's rise in the global economy, more couples participate in financial investing. Using the 2011 China Household Finance Survey, we examined factors influencing stock and fixed-income investments in the cities. Couples with urban residency were more likely to invest than couples without urban residency. Compared to traditional couples with highly-educated husbands only, couples with only highly-educated wives invested similarly, whereas couples with two highly- (less-) educated spouses were more (less) likely to invest. Further, we investigated how these relationships were mediated by household income and wealth, financial literacy, information acquisition, and risk tolerance. Overall, our findings suggest that household investing is shaped by both family structure (i.e., spouses' educational pairing) and institutional advantage (indicated by urban residency).

TI  - DIGITALIZATION AND INFORMAL MSME DIGITAL FINANCIAL INCLUSION FOR MSME DEVELOPEMENT IN THE FORMAL ECONOMY
T2  - JOURNAL OF EASTERN EUROPEAN AND CENTRAL ASIAN RESEARCH
AB  - This study examines digital financial inclusion and uses Fintech for informal micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to overcome the financing gap. The researchers used primarily qualitative methods, namely a qualitative analysis strategy verification through inductive analysis. The results show that Indonesia's fintech landscape makes MSME a driver of the digital economy so that they can overcome the financing gap in the informal sector. The challenges faced by Fintech in encouraging MSME business efficiency in the form of unbalanced agency distribution, data security, data access problems, low digital financial literacy, low connectivity, and interoperability can be overcome by taking advantage of existing opportunities. These opportunities include the role of MFIs and cooperatives in promoting financial inclusion and the development of telecommunications infrastructure networks in Indonesia. The novelty of this research is the comprehensive evaluation of achieved progress in digital financial inclusion for MSMEs in Indonesia and the developed recommendation for regulations by relevant authorities to encourage the business efficiency of MSMEs through facilitating digital financial inclusion.

TI  - Digital technology access, labor market behavior, and income inequality in rural China
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - This study uses China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data from 2010 to 2018 to empirically investigate the interplay between digital technology access, labor market behavior, and income inequality in rural China. The following salient conclusions are derived. Digital technology access has a substantial negative influence on individual income inequality in rural China, with a more pronounced inhibitory effect on inequality among low-income groups, males, middle and higher professional classes, and younger cohorts. Mechanism analysis suggests that digital technology access significantly impacts a range of rural labor practices, including increasing the frequency of digital technology use among rural inhabitants, decreasing credit costs, enhancing entrepreneurial activities, and boosting rural labor mobility. Based on these findings, this study proposes accelerating digital infrastructure development in rural regions, improving digital and financial literacy among rural residents, and refining inclusive digital financial services to facilitate more stable and sustainable progress to promote common prosperity.

TI  - Is the uphill road the one more taken? How task complexity prompts action on non-pressing tasks
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - In both personal and professional spheres, consumers decide when to initiate action on important tasks. Often, for important yet seemingly less-pressing tasks (e.g., saving for retirement), action initiation begins too late. This research is based on the novel insight that for purportedly non-pressing tasks, increasing perceived task complexity acts as a signal of urgency and prompts action, especially for novices. Studies 1 and 2 use a retirement savings context to demonstrate that, for novice investors (millennials, new job-market entrants, individuals with low financial literacy) who perceive retirement saving as non-pressing, framing the task as complex (versus simple) signals urgency and increases likelihood of action. In two additional studies, we replicate these effects to nudge individuals to take immediate online action (pilot) and protect online security (study 3). We discuss implications for corporations, policy makers, and consumers.

TI  - Personal bankruptcy and consumer credit delinquency: The case of personal finance education
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - Given the increasing complexities of the financial markets as well as a shift away from employer/government sponsored pensions to individuals managing their retirement funds, personal finance education is an important tool in order to navigate the evolving and complex financial environment. In this paper, I examine the impact of personal finance education on credit delinquency. Prior studies show that financial literacy affects financial decisions such as savings, retirement planning, wealth accumulation and stock market participation. Using U.S data on personal bankruptcy and consumer credit delinquency rates, I show that personal finance education is important in reducing personal bankruptcy as well as consumer credit delinquency rates. Furthermore, personal finance education does not appear to moderate the impact of gambling legislation on personal bankruptcy or consumer credit default.

TI  - Islamic religiosity and portfolio allocation: the Malaysian context
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to investigate the association between Muslim individuals' portfolio allocation choice and Islamic religiosity (levels and dimensions), controlling for risk tolerance and sociodemographic factors.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study uses primary data collected via survey questionnaires from a sample of 751 Muslim working individuals in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Owing to the ordinal nature of the dependent variable, which reflects the levels of proportions of risky assets in portfolios, the data were analyzed using an ordered probit regression model.
   Findings - The findings reveal that Islamic religiosity levels in general were insignificantly related to portfolio allocation, but that two dimensions of religiosity (virtue and obligation) significantly impact the allocations of risky assets in the portfolio. The higher the level of virtue, the lower the propensity to allocate risky assets into the portfolio. On the contrary, the higher the level of obligation, the higher the propensity to allocate risky assets in the portfolio. Meanwhile, individuals with higher risk tolerance, income and education levels show greater propensity to allocate risky assets in the portfolio.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample is restricted to Muslims in Kuala Lumpur; hence, the findings are not easily generalized to Muslim investors in general. Findings may differ between Muslims across the world, so future research needs to expand from a country specific to an international analysis. In addition, future studies could include other determinants of portfolio allocation, such as financial literacy.
   Practical implications - The findings of this study may assist financial planners and policymakers to better understand the drivers of portfolio allocation among their Muslim clients.
   Originality/value - While other studies have tended to focus on the impact of religiosity on the holdings of specific financial assets, such as Islamic bank accounts or Takaful, the present study explores the effect of Islamic religiosity dimensions on the allocations of risky assets in the portfolio. The study also develops an ordinal measure of portfolio allocation and makes a methodological contribution by using an ordered probit regression analysis.

TI  - Adopting Digital Signatures for Complex Financial Products in the French Banking Sector: How Technology Acceptance and User Literacy Matter
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB  - The advent of digital banking has transformed the financial landscape. However, the uptake of complex financial products (CFPs) with digital signatures (DSs) in European banks remains unexplored and warrants in-depth investigation. In this article, we address the gap by examining the online acquisition of CFPs, focusing on factors beyond the conventional parameters. By integrating the technology acceptance model (TAM), user literacy, and the dimension of human interaction, we analyze client acceptance of DSs in CFP transactions. We present an analysis of qualitative data from 716 clients of a French bank. Our findings reveal that DS adoption for CFPs hinges on TAM variables, combined with perceived risk, trust, and the levels of digital and financial literacy, along with the aspect of human interaction. We propose a novel risk management approach that blends the traditional risk management with client-bank coproduction, advocating for a collaborative model of risk sharing facilitated by DSs. Our article details the theoretical framework, methodology, findings, and discussions and concludes by offering theoretical insights, managerial recommendations, limitations, and avenues for future research.

TI  - The impact of digital finance on household consumption: Evidence from China
T2  - ECONOMIC MODELLING
CP  - Conference on Applied Finance, Macroeconomic Performance, and Economic Growth
AB  - Using panel data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) in 2013, 2015, and 2017 and the digital inclusive finance index developed by Peking University, this study examined impacts of the digital inclusive finance on household consumption and explored its mechanisms. Results suggest that the digital inclusive finance could promote households consumption. A heterogeneity analysis showed that households with fewer assets, lower income, less financial literacy and in third- and fourth-tier cities experienced larger facilitating effects of digital finance on consumption compared to their counterparts. For consumption categories, digital finance was positively correlated with food, clothing, house maintenance, medical care, and education and entertainment expenditures. In terms of consumption structure, digital finance mainly promoted the recurring household expenditures rather than the non-recurring expenditures. Further analyses based on the mediating model found that online shopping, digital payment, obtainment of online credit, purchase of financing products on the Internet and business insurance, were the main mediating variables through which digital finance affected household consumption.

TI  - Does Microfinance Singlehandedly Empower Women? A Case Study of Bangladesh
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - The role played by microfinancing in the empowerment of women has been a subject of debate in recent literature. By employing the case study method, this paper explores the influencing determinants. Data was obtained from a field interview comprised of 20 female microfinance borrowers and their male family members, as well as focus group discussions and participant observation. The economic, social, and political empowerment of the interviewed women were assessed using Kabeer's empowerment framework, and the results reveal that microfinancing does not influence the economic and political dimensions of female empowerment; instead, microfinancing was observed to empower women socially, particularly with respect to their participation in major decision-making. The results further indicate that the age, family type, educational level, financial literacy, and training of female microfinance clients play important roles in their empowerment.

TI  - FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN THE CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL AREAS
T2  - MANAGEMENT THEORY AND STUDIES FOR RURAL BUSINESS AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Financial inclusion is a means to make full use of financial services, which stimulates the introduction of innovation, mobilization of savings and investment support, and thus contributes to the economic development of territories. The purpose of the study is to substantiate scientific and practical approaches to determining the role and place of financial inclusion in sustainable development of rural areas. The state of financial inclusion in rural areas has been assessed having applied the statistical-economic and calculation-constructive methods. The abstract-logical method made it possible to prove the positive impact of financial inclusion on the sustainable development of rural areas and to offer proposals for its further advancement. It has been argued that the key tasks of financial inclusion in the context of sustainable development of rural areas are financial education, access to financial services, and protection of the rights of consumers of financial services.

TI  - Decomposition of the Financial Capability Construct: A Structural Model of Debt Knowledge, Skills, Confidence, Attitudes, and Behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - Based on a nationally representative sample of adult Poles (N = 1,004), we examined structural relationships between financial knowledge, skills, confidence, attitudes, and behavior in debt-domain. We found that financial confidence-at least regarding debt-related issues-is tied to debt attitudes and behavior beyond the extent to which the attitudes and behaviors are linked to objective debt knowledge. Moreover, the relationship between objective knowledge and confidence turned out to be insignificant in our study. These findings suggest that confidence should be used as a separate marker of financial capability. Having established that skills correlate with behavior and attitudes differently than objective knowledge, we argue also to include them separately in financial capability measurements.

TI  - Modeling key enablers influencing FinTechs offering SME credit services: A multi-stakeholder perspective
T2  - ELECTRONIC MARKETS
AB  - The study models inter-relationship among key enablers that influence the growth of FinTechs that offer credit services to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It focuses on emerging market of India, which is the world's third-largest FinTech centre. It employs Grey DEMATEL method to measure the cause-effect relationship based on the assessment given by FinTech practitioners, experts, policymakers, and investors. The results show that credit demand by SME borrowers, availability of alternate data sources, and Covid-19 are the critical enablers that exercise strong impact on FinTech system. Collaboration between FinTechs and traditional financial institutions, end-to-end financial solutions, and scalability of business operations are recognized as critical dependents that are hugely affected by others. The study recommends policymakers to foster collaborative environment, strengthen digital data landscape, and improve financial literacy to develop FinTech sector. It recommends practitioners to focus on data security and to offer end-to-end financial solutions to its SME borrowers.

TI  - 'Band aid' for women in the ready-made garment industry: self-help and surveillance in Bangladesh
T2  - GLOBALIZATIONS
AB  - After the collapse of the Rana Plaza building killed over a thousand garment workers in 2013, several transnational corporations partnered with nongovernmental organizations to offer factory-based training initiatives for women in Bangladesh. These programmes promote worthy goals, including women's empowerment, menstrual health and financial literacy. But textual and visual analysis of lesson plans, awareness posters and instructional videos for workers reveal two mechanisms that undermine transformative change: They splinter worker solidarity through a focus on individualistic self-improvement (self-help) and facilitate business-as-usual by selectively revealing and concealing aspects of workers' lives (surveillance). This study highlights the worker-facing side of corporate social responsibility and transnational business feminism's turn toward empowerment education. These programmes purport to be good for business and for women. However, the training materials provide women with what I call 'band aid' remedies by telling women how to fix themselves and by strategically covering or exposing their problems.

TI  - Addressing Financial Inclusion Challenges in Rural Areas from the Financial Services Marketing Employee Emotional Labor Dimension: Evidence from Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - Financial authorities basically regard low financial literacy rate and poor information and communication technology as the major challenges facing financial inclusion drive, particularly among rural dwellers in Nigeria. No study has assessed the cause of low financial inclusion from the financial services marketers' emotional labor perspective. This quantitative study attempted to close this gap by exploring how emotional labor variables relate to financial services sales performance and job satisfaction among bank marketers. Primary data were collected from 417 bank marketers operating in Edo and Delta States. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test the formulated hypotheses. The outcomes show that surface acting has a significant negative effect on financial service sales outcomes and job satisfaction, while deep acting was found to have a significant positive effect on financial service sales outcomes and job satisfaction among bank marketers.

TI  - Financial development and natural resource efficiency: Unlocking green growth potential
T2  - RESOURCES POLICY
AB  - The study aims to test the nexus between financial development and natural resource efficiency to determine the green growth potential. The correlation between financial development and natural resource efficiency has been a topic of much scholarly and policy discussion. This research seeks to investigate the complex connection within the specific setting of China between the years 2000 and 2019. The empirical analysis uses the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model. The study examines how progress in the finance industry might facilitate green economic expansion by improving the effective exploitation of natural resources. The results of our study demonstrate a strong and lasting connection between measures of financial progress and metrics of natural resource efficiency. More specifically, enhanced availability of finance improved financial literacy, and higher investment in sustainable initiatives have been shown to have a favorable effect on the effective use of natural resources.

TI  - Household Finance
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC LITERATURE
AB  - Household financial decisions are complex, interdependent, and heterogeneous, and central to the functioning of the financial system. We present an overview of the rapidly expanding literature on household finance (with some important exceptions) and suggest directions for future research. We begin with the theory and empirics of asset market participation and asset allocation over the life cycle. We then discuss household choices in insurance markets, trading behavior, decisions on retirement saving, and financial choices by retirees. We survey research on liabilities, including mortgage choice, refinancing, and default, and household behavior in unsecured credit markets, including credit cards and payday lending. We then connect the household to its social environment, including peer effects, cultural and hereditary factors, intra-household financial decision-making, financial literacy, cognition, and educational interventions. We also discuss literature on the provision and consumption of financial advice.

TI  - Financial Industry Views on the Prospective Role of Long-Term Care Insurance and Reverse Mortgages in Financing Long-Term Care in Croatia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGING & SOCIAL POLICY
AB  - Due to the government's modest role in taking care of aging adults, as well as a rapidly aging demographic and a high share of home ownership, Croatia is an interesting case for private long-term care (LTC) financing. This study uses a qualitative survey through interviews (N = 21) with specialists from the financial industry to examine the prospects for developing LTC insurance (LTCI) and reverse mortgages. The most important obstacles to developing reverse mortgages and LTCI are an emotional attachment to real estate and strong family ties. However, inadequately regulated and nontransparent housing and LTC markets, the weak rule of law, poor financial literacy, low trust in financial institutions, and the perception of government as the savior of last resort pose additional challenges. Combined insurance products with clearly defined benefits are the products showing the most market potential.

TI  - A Cross Country Study of Financial Inclusion and Economic Development with Special Emphasis on India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Policymakers generally associate financial inclusion with economic growth and poverty alleviation. This paper explores the empirical relationship between the Human Development Index (HDI) and Index of Financial Inclusion (IFI) across 128 countries using correlation and regression analysis in STATA. The study revealed their interdependence and showed that developed nations (with high incomes and HDI Ranks) had greater inclusion than less-developed countries. Other socioeconomic variables, including per-capita income, urbanization, and literacy rate, also exhibited a strong correlation. Hence, reducing inequalities and focusing on the inclusion of certain sections of society (especially rural, poor, women, and farmers) in the financial system is crucial. Structured programs by RBI, Government, and NGOs can help to improve financial literacy. Deeper penetration of financial services in specific states (Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and the North-Eastern States) and enhanced internet connectivity will also be helpful.

T2  - SMART-JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - Rapid digitalization has transformed financial services and yet the adoption of mutual funds in India remains low. The purpose of the study was to explore the factors, influencing the adoption of digital investment services of mutual fund distribution. Further, the study aims to develop a model, using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), to understand the dynamics between the factors and find out the driving power of factors, using Matrice d'Impacts Crois & eacute;s Multiplication Appliqu & eacute;e & agrave; un Classement (MICMAC) analysis. Findings revealed that financial literacy, socioeconomic status, and social influence reported the highest driving power. Attitude and trust were highly responsive to system changes, while regulatory support, investor protection, transparency, service quality, and interoperability, contributed gradually. The study would provide insights for mutual fund distributors and policymakers, to enhance the adoption of digital investment services. The development of a hierarchical model, to identify the contributing factors, is a unique contribution of this research.

TI  - THE IMPORTANCE OF METACOGNITIVE STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING COMPETITIVE BUSINESS COMPETENCIES
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPETITIVENESS
AB  - The aim of this study is to verify and evaluate experimentally the effect of using activating methods and the related application of metacognitive learning strategies in case studies. The research sample consisted of 220 students, 16-17 years old. The experiment was chosen as the basic research method. The authors' research focuses first on building a case study. This was subsequently verified experimentally in the second research phase, and its effect on the development of higher cognitive dimensions was evaluated. Relevant research tools were developed, including a case study adapted to each age group of students with a focus on relevant educational content and two non-standardized professional tests in the form of a post-test that was uniformly designed for the experimental and control group to determine the range of effects at the level of development of lower and higher-order thinking processes that the implemented methods can produce. The tests took into account the age of students, content and cognitive difficulty. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney u-test was chosen to verify null hypotheses at 5% significance. The results indicate that the application of metacognitive learning strategies at an adequate age and adequate level of cognitive abilities of students are the assumption of financial literacy and entrepreneurship support. Using activating teaching methods through the implementation of the case study method is more successful and effective in the development of higher-order thinking operations than the established traditional methods, which are still nowadays overused by teachers. This means that methods have a significant impact on the development of higher cognitive dimensions, which are the fundamental assumption of a successful career for economists and corporate managers. The development of these competencies strengthens the competitiveness of this profession in the labour market.

TI  - PREDICTING PRIVATE SAVING WITHIN MALAY COMMUNITY
T2  - ASIAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - Few reports have indicated that majority of Malaysians do not save enough for retirement and Malays are less likely to save money as compared to other races in Malaysia. A lot of attention has been given to the link between financial literacy and saving thus neglecting other factors that are closely related to individuals. According to Bandura's (1977) theory, financial behaviour is closely related to personal factors such as individual characteristic, cognitive ability, self-efficacy, and religious faith. Therefore, this study aims to examine all the factors predicting private saving. Using 224 Malay respondents, logistic regression analysis was conducted. This study found that parents and religious faith significantly predicted the likelihood of private saving, but individual characteristic, cognitive ability, and self-efficacy did not significantly predict the likelihood of private saving. Thus, this study recommends using parents and religious officers to guide the Malay communities in their private saving.

TI  - Was the expansion of housing credit in Japan good or bad?
T2  - JAPAN AND THE WORLD ECONOMY
AB  - This paper shows, using data from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey, that housing credit has become increasingly available over time in Japan, especially since 2000, and that this has made it easier for Japanese households to purchase housing and enabled them to do so at an earlier age. However, it also shows that the greater availability of housing credit has increased households' housing loan repayment burden, which has resulted in their cutting back on their other consumption expenditures and created the potential for retirement insecurity. Another concern is that the increasing availability of housing credit has been accompanied by a pronounced shift from fixed-rate to variable-rate housing loans. This is cause for concern given the low level of financial literacy that prevails among the Japanese population and the likelihood that interest rates on variable-rate housing loans will be raised sooner or later as monetary policy is tightened.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We study the effects of the Liberty Bond drives of World War I on financial intermediation in the 1920s and beyond. Using panel data on US counties, and an instrument that captures differences in the approaches used to market the bonds, we find that higher Liberty Bond subscription rates led to an increase in investment banks and a contraction in commercial bank assets. We also find that in the late 1930s, individuals residing in states where Liberty Bond subscription rates had been higher were more likely to report owning stocks or bonds. Although they were conducted to support the American effort in World War I, these bond drives reshaped American finance. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The effect of the digital divide on household consumption in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - The rapid digitization of economy and the widening of digital divide have attracted the attention and interest of many researchers. In such a context, this paper aims to identify the causal effect of the digital divide on household consumption. Using the 2017 and 2019 waves of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data, we find that the digital divide has led to a significant reduction in household consumption. Besides, such a negative correlation results from the combined effects of (i) rising unemployment, (ii) intensified liquidity constraints, and (iii) declining financial literacy. Furthermore, it is discovered that the digital divide has different impacts on households depending on the specific consumption category, thus hindering the diversification of consumption. Our findings are expected to shed some light on the little-documented evidence with profound implications for the socioeconomic policies on the application of technology to enhance the efficiency and inclusiveness of the digital economy.

TI  - The effect of a moveable collateral registry on MSME access to finance: Evidence from Malawi
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This study explores to answer the question: does the introduction of a moveable collateral registry lead to significant increase in access to credit to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises? We examine this question through a unique dataset collected from the moveable collateral registry and commercial banks in Malawi. The findings indicate that the introduction of the registry in Malawi has led to marginal increase in MSME's access to bank credit. Real property, however, remains the preferred collateral and ability to repay the loan is the most important consideration amongst banks in assessing whether to lend to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. We recommend the registry to integrate into its programs financial literacy training for MSMEs, and credit guarantee schemes to mitigate the perceived high risk associated with small enterprises. This will equip the MSMEs to keep proper accounts and enhance their access to the registry and bank credit.

TI  - Smart tools? A randomized controlled trial on the impact of three different media tools on personal finance
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB  - By using a randomized controlled trial we test the impact of three treatments on financial literacy (knowledge, attitudes, reported behavior) among adolescents in Austria. Treatments comprise a documentary movie on debt, an internet exercise and a budgeting smartphone app. It is investigated if particularly the latter two instruments could serve as standalone alternatives (nudges) to conventional teaching interventions. Users of the budgeting app report to check their current account balance significantly more often than the control group. The web exercise, however, neither raises interest in personal finance issues nor significantly increases basic financial knowledge. The documentary movie did not affect attitudes towards saving or private credits. Even if it is only about raising awareness and interest in financial matters among adolescents, the ICT applications tested in this study thus do not lend strong support to policies solely relying on digital "stand-alone" solutions of similar design.

TI  - The effect of financial education on students' consumer choices: Evidence from a randomized experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Financial education is often considered to be a necessary condition in order to stimulate better consumer choices. We investigate this claim by analyzing the impact of a financial education course on consumer choices made by 688 students of the 8th and 9th grade. We combine a randomized controlled trial with a discrete choice experiment to analyze how financial education and other critical factors of a purchase decision like price, credit availability, information on product quality, and promotion affect consumer decisions at a young age. We find that students favor purchase options with free gifts and positive consumer reviews. They also prefer cash payments over credit. However, we do not find evidence that this behavior is triggered by financial education. Financial education does not automatically result in better consumer choices, even if the financial education course increased students' financial literacy. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A booster to conditional cash transfer programme: experimental evidence on financial inclusion and livelihood enhancement project
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS
AB  - While Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) Programmes have contributed to sustained economic growth in many countries, existing evaluations show that the Honduran CCT programme has only a modest impact on poverty. This study examines a causal impact of a training project on financial inclusion and livelihood enhancement conducted as a booster to increase the effectiveness of the CCT programme. Based on a graduation approach, the project provides multi-faceted interventions to randomly selected CCT beneficiaries. We estimate intention-to-treat effects and find that the interventions significantly increase financial literacy and inclusion, including knowledge of financial institutions, financial accounts, bookkeeping, and pro-saving attitudes. We also find that the treated individuals in rural areas gain significant income from business, livestock farming, and agriculture by switching employment. Importantly, we find evidence that the interventions contribute to female empowerment by changing the intra-household decision-making process. The impact is much larger in rural areas, where financial markets are underdeveloped, and the traditional gender pattern is more prevalent. The intervention seems to reduce the urban-rural gap.

TI  - Does financial inclusion moderate the effect of digital transformation on banks' performance in China?
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Digital transformation remains a passion. Globally, science and technology are transforming businesses to make them more competitive and conducive to sustainable development. However, rapid advancements in financial technology have enabled financial institutions to steal customers from traditional banks, resulting in their demise. Consequently, this study employs the System GMM-two step estimator and data from 118 Chinese banks from 2014 to 2021 investigate the issue. Empirical evidence suggests that banks' digital transformation has a negative impact on their profitability to some extent, but digital inclusive finance has enabled the bank to change its digital transformation behavior and enhance its operational performance. Therefore, banks must continue to strengthen their digital transformation by expanding online customer services, increasing the use of e-accounts and mobile applications, providing digital offline services, strengthening digital risk management and privacy and security controls, reducing customer psychological risk, and promoting financial inclusion. Financial inclusion should simultaneously achieve reduced financial exclusion of customers and increased financial literacy of customers. All these factors will help banks to maintain profitability by leveraging synergies with financial inclusion in the process of digital transformation.

TI  - Financial overconfidence, promotion of financial advice, and aging
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - This paper proposes and validates a method to measure financial overconfidence in older people through incentivized economic experiments instead of answers to hypothetical questions. Specifically, financial overconfidence is quantified in terms of incorrect answers to a standardized financial literacy questionnaire on which participants reject the help of a financial advisor (overconfidence based on advice aversion) or declare that they are confident that they know the right answer (overconfidence based on confidence self-assessment). Using experimental data from a sample of 295 older Internet users in Spain, analysis shows that the two proposed behavioral measures of financial overconfidence are consistent. Moreover, the analysis confirms the well documented finding of financial overconfidence in older people. The estimation of two analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models suggests that, among older people, overconfidence decreases with age and education level (i. e., university studies). However, no statistically significant effect of gender on overconfidence level is found.

TI  - Financial inclusion to build economic resilience in small-scale fisheries
T2  - MARINE POLICY
AB  - Lack of access to financial services leaves fishing households and their fishing businesses with limited options to obtain financing and manage cash flow for family expenses or business investments. The lack of access is filled by informal lenders that can also be the primary buyers of fish or the owners of the boats. For rural fishing households, access to formal financial services, also known as financial inclusion, can bring increased financial resilience to the household. The paper reviews the current barriers to financial inclusion of small-scale fishing households such as limited financial capability and literacy, lack of assets for collateral, geographic distance from a financial institution and lack of formal identification. It also discusses solutions to address these barriers including financial literacy, de-risking financial institutions, financial data collection, provision of a range of financial services besides credit, and understanding the client that will enable fishing households to retain control over their earnings and savings. Financial inclusion can help reduce the different vulnerabilities of poor fishing households and rural communities and lead to improved economic resilience.

TI  - A MODEL FOR PERSONAL FINANCIAL PLANNING TOWARDS RETIREMENT
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - One problem for sustainability of systems pensions is how people without specialized financial training could manage their resources and their actual personal intentions towards retirement. Research objective is to analyse the relationship among several factors that affect the behaviour towards retirement, the financial management practices and the financial resources, by carrying out a structural equation model (SEM) that was tested in Spanish workers sample in three phases. The influence of financial literacy, financial retirement objectives, optimism on retirement, tolerance to financial risk, and the commitment to financial planning at time 1, are analysed as explanatory variables of financial management practices at time 2. Financial resources for retirement at time 3 are explained by financial management practices.
   According to results, the model can predict the 36% of the variance of financial management practices and 53% of the variance of financial resources for retirement. Thus, the model can be used for checking of knowledge of the personal financial behaviour before retirement, what enables a better personal financial planning. It would be possible to apply a model based on self-assessment in order to implement a complementary financial planning that would allow to maintain the welfare during retirement.

TI  - Modeling strategies to protect investors from financial fraud collapses on social networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B
AB  - Financial fraud is more likely to spread and produce serious and adverse results through social networks. This study investigates four protection strategies: the uniform protection strategy, the random protection strategy, the targeted protection strategy, and the acquaintance protection strategy based on the potential-investor-divestor (PID) model. The simulation results show that the targeted protection strategy is the best solution for both ER and BA networks. The random protection strategy is the least efficient solution, as it requires spreading a large number of anti-fraud messages to achieve a relatively good performance. The acquaintance protection strategy performs closely to the targeted protection strategy in terms of social dynamics. However, the uniform protection strategy is better than the acquaintance protection strategy, as it involves fewer victims when it collapses. This study suggests that the regulators should protect investors from financial fraud collapses by promoting the financial literacy education and regulating the behaviors of influential people.

TI  - Quest for financial inclusion via digital financial services (Fintech) during COVID-19 pandemic: case study of women in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - Based upon an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study aims to investigate the factors influencing the behavioral intention to adopt Fintech from the perspective of Indonesian women. The research data were collected from 409 Indonesian female respondents and analyzed using the SEMinR statistical data analysis tool. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess this research's measurement model and structural model. The result shows that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, user innovativeness, attitude, trust, and brand image significantly positively impact behavioral intention to adopt Fintech among Indonesian women. Meanwhile, perceived ease of use, financial literacy, and government support are found to have indirect relationships with behavioral intention. In addition, moderation analysis revealed that the saving habits of women during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the relationship between their innovativeness and behavioral intention to adopt Fintech. Based on these results, we recommend practical suggestions to the government, policymakers, and aspiring Fintech service providers further to enhance women's empowerment through digital financial inclusion.

TI  - MANAGING EDUCATIONAL DETERMINANTS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION AS A KEY FACTOR OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: LOGIT-PROBIT MODELING
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - This article is devoted to the question of identifying the relationship between the dimensions of formal education in the country and the level of its financial inclusion. To achieve it, logit-probit modeling was used between the integral indicator of financial inclusion, based on principal-component factors calculation, and various dimensions of education. Ninety-three countries with different levels of socio-economic development were chosen as the object of the study. As a result, the positive statistically significant influence of such determinants as financial literacy, duration of compulsory education, government expenditure on education, pupil-teacher ratio, school enrollment at the secondary level was confirmed. School enrollment at the primary level had a negative influence on financial inclusion. This vector of research will allow to form the main directions of management of educational determinants of financial inclusion, which are important vectors of reforming the education system and ensuring financial inclusion at the national level.

TI  - Nonlinear and nonparametric causal relationship between financial inclusion and sustainable environment in South Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - This study analyzes the causal connection between financial inclusion and carbon emission in selected South Asian countries through a quantile technique-based linear Granger and non-parametric causality test. The analysis of the study covers quarterly data from 1980 Q1 to 2019 Q4. However, the linear Granger causality assessment outcome does not indicate any causal relationship between financial inclusion and carbon emission. In contrast, results from non-parametric assessment reveal a non-linear connection between the variables. The non-parametric test results of the South Asian countries exhibit that financial inclusion leads to carbon emission, which instigates the deterioration of the environment, except for Bhutan. Subsequently, creating awareness by promoting renewable energy resources is essential while investing in fuel-efficient technology to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The results of this study provide significant information to the governments and policymakers in emerging countries to improve financial literacy among people to reduce the risk of global warming by encouraging investment in energy-efficient resources.

T2  - ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB  - Voluntary health insurance (VHI) and out-of-pocket payments (OOP) supplement medical services provided by public health schemes. While most literature on this topic deals with national specificities, we examine at the cross-country market level, the determinants of VHI and OOP, and the impact of financial development on choosing between the two for 26 European Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries between 2000 and 2018. We show that citizens from less developed countries with lower gross domestic products tend to compensate for dissatisfaction from insufficient public coverage through VHI and OOP. Additionally, the findings reveal that VHI is preferred over OOP when financial development is higher. Countries with formal financial activities have high levels of financial literacy and trust in healthcare services, and VHI prevails. Conversely, countries more prone to informal financial activities prefer OOP. We outline the triggers for using VHI to supplement public health spending to address the financial burden of OOP.

TI  - Responsible access to credit for sole-traders and micro-organizations under unstable market conditions with psychometrics
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - In a context of market volatility, the growing complexity of financial products, and a shift towards self-employment, there is an increasing demand for inclusive financial services for sole traders and micro-organizations. To address this need, we conducted a study using real-time data from a Fintech lender in the Czech Republic to assess the effectiveness of a new financial literacy based psychometric credit scoring model (PSM) in improving access to finance for micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSME) sector, particularly sole traders, and micro-organizations, during volatile market conditions. This study affirms that PSMs play a significant role in responsibly including this underserved sector. Specifically, we observed a 30% higher approval rate and a 23% lower default rate when utilizing the PSM versus the traditional credit scoring model (TCSM). Moreover, during the period of substantial market volatility and instability, such as the state-of-emergency during the COVID-19 pandemic, the PSM exhibited a 13% higher approval rate at a 20% lower default rate than the TCSM. This evidence supports the proposition that PSMs offer a viable option for promoting financial inclusion and targeted financial education among MSMEs in the face of instable financial markets.

TI  - Impact of digital financial infrastructure in furthering financial inclusion in India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Information technology and digital infrastructure have ushered in India's fourth industrial revolution. One of the most important aspects of providing digital services is digital identity, which has become possible after the implementation of biometric identification (Aadhaar). The goal of this study is to highlight the current state of the banking and mobile money industries. This article highlights India's success in digital adoption as well as points out areas that need to be improved to realise the goals of financial inclusion. The study also compares the current state of India/s financial inclusion to that of other SAARC and high-income nations. Financial inclusion is being hampered by a number of factors, including digital fraud and the difference in digital services between rural and urban areas, the report said. Financial integration, as well as strong digital security and financial literacy programs, can improve India/s financial stability and long-term prosperity.

TI  - Directors' duties of care and the value of auditing
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - This paper uses court's decision in ASIC v Healy (The Centro Case) as a natural experiment through which to empirically examine, and demonstrate, the importance of strengthening "directors' duties of care. The Centro decision strengthened directors' duties of care by requiring them to make an independent assessment of auditors' reports, rather than merely relying on auditors' statements. It also required them to have a base level of financial literacy and to look for, and notice, obvious issues, especially ones that are important in the context.. The paper assesses the impact of the Centro case by analyzing whether Centro increased the market value of auditing expenditure. The results are positive: the strengthened directors duties are associated with higher CARs for firms that spend more on auditing. Further, after Centro, auditing expenditure had a more positive relationship with market values. Overall, the results demonstrate the importance of strengthening directors' duties of care.

TI  - Fixed rate versus adjustable rate mortgages: Evidence from euro area banks
T2  - EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Why do residential mortgages carry a fixed or an adjustable interest rate? To answer this question we study unique data from 103 banks belonging to 73 different banking groups across twelve countries in the euro area. To explain the large cross-country and time variations observed, we distinguish between household conditions that determine the local demand for credit and the characteristics of banks that supply credit. As bank funding mostly occurs at the group level, we disentangle these two sets of factors by comparing the outcome observed for the same banking group across the different countries. Local household conditions dominate. In particular we find that the share of new loans with a fixed rate is larger when: (1) the historical volatility of inflation is lower, (2) the correlation between unemployment and the short-term interest rate is higher, (3) households' financial literacy is lower, and (4) the use of local mortgages to back covered bonds and of mortgage-backed securities is more widespread.

AB  - Access to healthcare is a Social Determinant of Health that is associated with public health outcomes and barriers to access disproportionately affect African American adults. This study used a health and financial literacy approach to qualitatively assess how African American adults access healthcare and potential barriers faced (n = 20). Results indicated a wide range of experiences generally split between positive and negative experiences in access to healthcare. Specific themes that emerged included scheduling issues and appointment availability, expense of care, lack of transparency in insurance coverage, the need for more primary care clinics and enhanced community outreach and education on how to access healthcare. This research identifies a need for increased education surrounding health insurance coverage and an identified need for more local physicians or ease of scheduling. All participants in this study stated they were covered by health insurance of some form. Future research should examine these issues in the context of socioeconomic and insurance status.

TI  - Australians' Financial Wellbeing and Household Debt: A Panel Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - "An excess of everything is bad ". This famous old proverb fits well with the current condition of Australian household debt that is continuously rising. Research in Australia's household indebtedness is scarce and strategies to control the rising household debt remain contentious. The government of Australia has introduced financial literacy and financial capability measures to help control the rising household debt. Given that the literature highlights the importance of improving financial wellbeing, we analyse if financial wellbeing is a factor, which could be relevant to the reduced household debt. We use the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia panel survey in our analysis and find that improved financial wellbeing is associated with the reduced debt-taking behaviour of Australians. Our robust analysis confirms our findings. Finally, our empirical results suggest that improving households' perception of their personal financial situation can bring improvement in their financial decisions, including the decision to take on debt.

TI  - Exploring Financial Well-being's Impact on Retirement Planning: The Mediating Role of Financial Attitude
T2  - FIIB BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - This study seeks to examine the impact of financial attitude, financial well-being and selected socio-economic factors on retirement planning. Employing a survey-based approach, primary data was gathered from 506 respondents using structured questionnaires through convenience sampling. The research hypotheses were examined using the application of structural equation modelling, with a special emphasis on assessing the mediating influence of financial attitude on the association between financial well-being and retirement planning. This study also examines the potential moderating influences of factors, including age, gender, education and income, on the association between financial attitude, financial well-being and retirement planning. The findings illustrate a significant correlation between an individual's financial perspective, financial welfare and inclination to participate in retirement preparation. Moreover, it was discovered that certain variables exerted significant moderating effects on these relationships. The research acknowledges certain limitations, such as the omission of variables like financial knowledge and external influences such as parental and societal factors. These research implications can guide policymakers and institutions in the creation of effective financial literacy programs and investor awareness seminars.

TI  - Digital Inclusive Finance and Family Wealth: Evidence from LightGBM Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - With the rapid development of digital technology in China, Digital Inclusive Finance, which uses digital financial services to promote financial inclusion, is developing rapidly. This paper uses the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion index of China and China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) data to construct a predictive model using the LightGBM machine learning algorithm to study whether Digital Inclusive Finance can predict household wealth and analyze the characteristics of strong predictive ability for household wealth. They found that: (1) the introduction of the Digital Financial Inclusion index can improve the prediction performance of the household wealth model; (2) financial literacy and age characteristics are the key characteristics of household wealth accumulation; (3) the coverage and depth of Digital Inclusive Finance has a significant effect on family wealth accumulation, but the degree of digitization acts as a disincentive factor. This paper not only uses machine learning methods to do research on Digital Inclusive Finance and family wealth from a more comprehensive perspective, but also provides effective theoretical support for the key factors that enhance family wealth.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING IN EMERGING ECONOMIES
AB  - Purpose The paper aims to provide insights into executives' perceptions of risk management disclosures and such disclosures' determinants. The paper extends the emerging literature by using institutional theories in the context of a developing country. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 36 executives directly involved in risk management disclosures, policy-making and monitoring. Findings The interview data show evidence that corporate risk management disclosures are still at a low level. The reasons for non-disclosure can be related to institutional weaknesses, lack of disciplinary action and political interference. Additionally, central bank autonomy, limited perception of accountability, demand from influential stakeholders, lack of financial literacy, aim to keep annual reports brief, etc. results in the dearth of risk disclosure by the banks. Research limitations/implications The study suggests that understanding the importance of risk management disclosures and preparing for the uncertainty will keep the business moving. Originality/value The study seeks to contribute to the literature by investigating the executives' perceptions of risk management disclosures and its' determinants in the context of a developing country where non-compliance to the regulatory standard is high.

TI  - FINTECH INDUSTRY IN UKRAINE: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - The article considers the issues of development of the financial technology market, its opportunities and obstacles, as well as the need and inevitability of the introduction of fintech solutions in the financial and credit spheres. The main purpose of the research is to determine the role of fintech services in the state economy, the prospects for their development, as well as to substantiate the trends of adaptation of classical credit institutions and consumers of financial services to new financial technologies at different stages of their development. Systematization of literature sources and approaches to solving the problem of intensifying activities in the field of innovative finance has shown that fintech is a specific cross-sectoral industry, which lies on the border of financial and IT spheres, consists of companies that use technology to improve the efficiency of financial services and encompasses digital innovations and programs that facilitate the creation and implementation of financial products.The urgency of solving this scientific problem is that the market of financial technologies is one of the fastest growing. That is why it highlights the need for traditional financial institutions to digitize their activities through a radical change in the business model in order to strengthen competitive positions and provide strategic advantages. The research of the implementation of financial technologies in the article is carried out in the following logical sequence: systematization of stages of development of the fintech industry; assessment of the development of the fintech sphere in Ukraine in the context of the transition to the stage of integration with the banking system; study of the strengths and weaknesses of domestic banks and fintech companies, outlining obstacles and necessary changes for further digitization of the financial and credit system; research of the process of implementation of fintech services on the example of the technology life cycle model; assessment of the relationship between the level of financial and digital literacy of the population and the depth of promotion of innovative fintech products; identifying ways to increase the financial and digital inclusion of the population of Ukraine. Methods of the empirical, experimental and theoretical levels became the methodological tools of the conducted research. The results were evaluated and analyzed on the basis of surveys conducted in 2017-2019 by the Ukrainian Association of Fintech and Innovative Companies, the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine, the Ukrainian division of the British audit and consulting company Ernst &Young, and the US Agency for International Development. The article presents the results of an empirical analysis of the relations and interdependence of classical and innovative financial institutions, which showed the inevitability of the processes of digitization of financial services. The study empirically confirms and theoretically proves that the favorable development of the fintech industry is based on the following: the level of public awareness in the field of finance and information technology; the level of innovative development of financial institutions and the degree of penetration of the fintech companies in the financial market of the country; completeness of the legal framework.

TI  - Unintentional teaching of entrepreneurial competences
T2  - INDUSTRY AND HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Research on entrepreneurship education (EE) emphasizes the role of learning environments, contexts and pedagogical choices in developing students' entrepreneurial competences. EE has assumed that it solely carries the task of improving entrepreneurial competences. Yet, the objectives, content and methods of teaching vary, and hence non-entrepreneurship teachers' classrooms can also provide a learning environment for entrepreneurial competences. However, whether or not this kind of unintentional teaching of entrepreneurial competences takes place has not been widely addressed. In this study, the authors investigate how business school non-entrepreneurship teachers' teaching methods unintentionally match the known framework of entrepreneurial competences. The findings indicate that non-entrepreneurship teachers do unintentionally expose their students to entrepreneurial competences such as creativity, learning from experience and financial literacy. However, competences such as opportunity recognition, perseverance and mobilizing resources do not receive similar attention. The findings indicate that some entrepreneurial competences are not solely owned by EE, but can be embedded in non-entrepreneurship education. Accordingly, the study extends the current understanding of EE and which "niche" competences should be emphasized in it, but also demonstrates how non-entrepreneurship teachers can expose students to entrepreneurial competences while teaching in their own subject areas.

TI  - The Role of External and Internal Team Coaches in Teacher Design Teams. A Mixed Methods Study
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - Teacher design teams (TDTs) are increasingly used as a means for teacher professional development. It has been posited that for teacher learning to occur, TDTs need support from team coaches. These coaches are either external experts or peer teachers that guide the team from within. The current literature is in debate on whether external or internal coaches are most effective in supporting TDTs. In this study, we, therefore, examine whether these coach types differ in how they fulfil their role. We additionally evaluate how coaching interacts with the team learning process and the TDT trajectory's outcomes. We used a mixed methods design in the context of a large-scale TDT trajectory in Flanders (Belgium). We administered questionnaires among 63 teachers of 18 TDTs, and conducted interviews with the coaches of 14 TDTs. Our results indicate that coaching activities correlate with the majority of team learning beliefs and behaviours (TLBB) examined, as well as with perceived team effectiveness and the quality of material developed. Whereas teachers in TDTs with an internal coach seem to evaluate the coaching activities and the TLBB more positively than teachers in TDTs with an external coach, the opposite holds for perceptions of the trajectory's outcomes.

TI  - A Comparison of Financial Well-Being and Its Antecedents Across Different Employment Categories in Malaysia
T2  - GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS
AB  - This study compares the level of financial well-being (FWB) and its antecedents (financial stress, financial behaviour, financial literacy, and the internal locus of control (LOC)) across individuals of different employment categories in Malaysia. Second, it investigates the relationship between those antecedents and FWB and compares the differences in the strength. Data were collected from 1,867 respondents from four employment groups using a questionnaire-based survey. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to achieve the first research objective, and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to achieve the second research objective. The results indicate that FWB and its antecedents of Malaysian employees vary considerably across employment categories. The FWB of the unemployed and private-sector workers is significantly lower than their government sector and self-employed counterparts. Financial stress, financial behavior, and an internal LOC are the most determinative of employees' FWB, however, they have varying degrees of impact across different employment categories. The results relate to employers and policymakers in formulating strategies to promote higher FWB among Malaysian employees, based on their employment categories.

TI  - The impact of digital finance on household insurance purchases: evidence from micro data in China
T2  - GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE
AB  - Using panel data from the 2013, 2015 and 2017 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) and the digital finance index developed by Peking University, this study examines the impact of digital finance on household insurance purchases and explores its mechanisms. The results indicate that digital finance can promote household insurance purchases by increasing residents' financial literacy and their accessibility to internet financial services. A heterogeneity analysis reveals that digital finance has a more positive effect on the insurance purchases of households with fewer assets, lower income and located in less developed and rural areas. Regarding the type of insurance, digital finance enhances the purchase of property and life rather than health insurance. The regression results of household insurance purchases on the three dimensions of digital finance show that the breadth of coverage and depth of usage of digital finance have more significant impacts on household insurance purchases than digitalisation level. Robustness checks with different measures and samples, also addressing potential endogeneity using the instrumental variable approach, show the reliability of our findings.

TI  - Rethinking digital financial inclusion: Evidence from Bangladesh
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - A growing body of literature is advancing the impact of financial inclusion and digital finance on marginalized populations. However, mainstream scholarship has not focused on understanding the potential drivers and challenges of digital approaches to financial inclusion. This study aims to investigate the mismatch between assumptions implicit in the financial inclusion discourse and ideas of access and use of digital technologies and seeks to move the discourse forward through a comprehensive framework for digital financial inclusion. Our study showed that the social dynamics of financial engagement with new technologies require a move beyond a simple individualistic adopter/non-adopter binary framework and ?supply oriented? financial infrastructure. We conclude that although digital services have eased and bridged the gap of physical access to financial services, such services have not been utilised due to lack of basic connectivity, financial literacy and social awareness. This article theoretically contributes to digital financial services adoption literature by offering a significant critical overview and a new perspective on both digital finance and financial inclusion mechanisms.

TI  - Bank competition and household informal credit
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - This study examines the relationship between bank competition and informal household credit. Using data from four rounds of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), we find that increased competition among banks significantly reduces households' use of informal credit. To establish causality, we create a quasi-natural experiment based on the relaxation policy for city commercial bank branch expansion and obtain consistent results. We further uncover two mechanisms through which bank competition affects informal credit use: reducing interest rates on formal loans and improving financial literacy among households. Moreover, the heterogeneous analysis shows that higher-income and asset-rich households, as well as those residing in urban areas, are more negatively affected by bank competition in terms of informal credit access, whereas its influence on informal credit in agricultural production and medical expenses for households is not statistically significant. Overall, the results imply that fostering moderate competition in the banking industry can diminish the reliance on informal credit markets and offer a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the banking sector and household credit.

TI  - Psychological Ownership of (Borrowed) Money
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB  - The current research introduces the concept of psychological ownership of borrowed money, a construct that represents how much consumers feel that borrowed money is their own. The authors observe both individual-level and contextual-level variation in the degree to which consumers feel psychological ownership of borrowed money, and variation on this dimension predicts willingness to borrow money for discretionary purchases. At an individual level, psychological ownership of borrowed money is distinct from other individual factors such as debt aversion, financial literacy, income, intertemporal discounting, materialism, propensity to plan, self-control, spare money, and tightwad-spendthrift tendencies, and it predicts willingness to borrow above and beyond these factors. At a contextual level, the authors document systematic differences in psychological ownership between different debt types. They show that these differences in psychological ownership manifest in consumers' online search behavior and explain consumers' differential interest in borrowing across debt types. Finally, the authors demonstrate that psychological ownership of borrowed money is malleable, such that framing debt using language lower in psychological ownership can reduce consumers' propensity to borrow.

TI  - Access and usage of financial products in India: A gender gap analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ENGINEERING
AB  - This paper examines the status and determinants of the gender gap in access and usage of financial products and services using 3000 sample of Findex survey data 2021 in India. The results provide evidence to support the gender gap in access and usage of financial services. Particularly they are prominent in access to Mobile Money Accounts (MMAs; 12.03%), debit card (16.27%), and credit card (4.91%). At the same time, a remarkable gender gap was also found in the usage of financial products, specifically in MMA savings (4.25%), deposits (11.52%), withdrawal from accounts (6.83%), debit cards (13.27%) and credit cards (3.94%) usage. Finally, this paper documented the gender gap in access and use of financial products explained by a lower level of education, income, employment, mobile phone ownership, and internet access. The findings suggest that increasing traditional and digital financial literacy and employment opportunity among women are essential. It is also recommended to expand internet connectivity and mobile devices to all socio-economic categories of women.

TI  - Developing and Validating Constructs: A Pragmatic Measurement of Financial Inclusion as a Tool for Sustainable Growth
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Given the ubiquity of sustainability, the study attempts to develop and validate measurement constructs for financial inclusion. Further, it empirically examines the statistical relationship between validated constructs of financial inclusion and financial empowerment of blue-collar migrant workers. This empirical study proposes an exclusive research framework to inspect the development and validation of measurement scales for financial inclusion in the context of sustainable growth in India. The primary data were collected using the structured interview schedule among 268 blue-collar migrant workers. The Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was employed to validate measurement constructs of financial inclusion and examine their hypothetical and conjectural relationships with the help of multiple correlation analysis. This paper identified eight valid and reliable underlying constructs of financial inclusion with the help of an exploratory factor study. The underlying constructs are ease of access, usage, availability, affordability, physical proximity, awareness and knowledge, financial literacy, and financial empowerment. Further, the outcomes of this study also confirmed that the underlying constructs of financial inclusion have a significant positive influence on the financial empowerment of blue-collar migrant workers.

TI  - ARE TWO HEADS REALLY BETTER THAN ONE IN INTRA-HOUSEHOLD FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT? EVIDENCE ON THE FINANCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF COUPLES IN POLAND
T2  - SOUTH EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - Research shows that involvement in infra-household financial management fosters the development of financial literacy and sound financial behaviour. However, little is known about how different intra-couple financial management styles (sole versus joint management) affect the way consumers act when confronted with typical financial matters. Using a simple classifier allowing to distinguish households in which both partners undertake financial activity from those in which only one partner is involved in managing household finances, we applied statistical tests of significant differences and multiple linear regression models to determine whether the financial behaviour of joint participants is distinct from that of sole participants in Poland. Mann-Whitney U test showed that significant differences exist in credit management behaviour, with individuals who share participation performing better behaviour in this domain compared to sole managers. Credit management also appears to be the most problematic domain of household financial management where undesirable behaviour is the most likely. However, closer inspection with linear regression revealed that these differences can be attributed to socio-demographic variables such as age, place of residence, income, and number of dependent children.

TI  - University education, homeownership and housing wealth
T2  - CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - We utilise the implementation of the 1999 higher education expansion in China as a natural experiment to examine the relationship between university educational attainment, homeown-ership and housing wealth. Using data from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies, results from our preferred models, which correct for endogeneity, suggest that having a university qualification generates a 3.5-6.3 percentage points increase in the probability of homeownership and a 24.3-51.1 percentage points increase in total housing wealth. We also find that holding a uni-versity qualification increases the number of houses one owns and housing wealth for those whose housing wealth is above the median. We find that self-reported social status and entitle-ment to superannuation are channels through which higher education affects homeownership and housing wealth and that financial literacy is a channel through which higher education affects housing wealth. We find considerable heterogeneity in the impact of higher education on housing outcomes across gender, family income levels, parent education and between urban and rural areas.

TI  - The Determinants of Microinsurance Demand
T2  - GENEVA PAPERS ON RISK AND INSURANCE-ISSUES AND PRACTICE
AB  - The purpose of this article is to structure the extant knowledge on the determinants of microinsurance demand in a manner that achieves several outcomes. First is to offer a specific economic structure to the review through use of Outreville's insurance demand framework. Second is to identify key questions that arise out of structuring the material in this way. In particular, we attempt to clarify the critical open questions in microinsurance demand through use of Outreville's framework. Third, through comparison with literature on traditional insurance demand, we identify opportunities to understand not only the microinsurance market better, but also the traditional market. To achieve these outcomes, we review the academic literature on microinsurance demand published between 2000 and early 2014 and compare these results with evidence in the literature regarding traditional insurance markets. The review identifies 12 key factors affecting microinsurance demand, and further highlights that research focused on the role of contract performance (including basis risk and quality), trust, financial literacy and informal risk-sharing mechanisms may be most fruitful in expanding microinsurance markets.

TI  - Inching to Impact: The Demand Side of Social Impact Investing
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB  - Social impact investing (SII) is transforming the availability of private capital for nonprofits and social enterprises, but demand is not yet meeting supply. This paper analyzes the perceived barriers faced by nonprofits in engaging with SII, arguing the need to assess differences using a policy field framework. Four parameters of a subsector are conceptualized as shaping participation in SII: the scale of investment required, embeddedness in place, the need for radical innovation, and the configuration of intermediaries (such as loan funds and market brokers). Based on 25 interviews with leaders of nonprofits and intermediaries in affordable housing and community economic development in Canada, the study finds that significant barriers are a lack of knowledge of the market, inadequate financial literacy, and the challenges of measuring and valuing social impacts. In addition, nonprofits report that, in spite of the inherent importance of social impact in this form of investing, they currently make limited use of evaluation and impact metrics, and perceive that intermediaries and investors, particularly in affordable housing, still put a greater emphasis on financial over social returns.

TI  - Credit record overconfidence and alternative financial service use
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of credit record overconfidence on the use of alternative financial services (AFSs). Design/methodology/approach Using data from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), the authors estimate logistic regressions on the use of at least one AFS by adding a credit record confidence variable that captures deviations between self-assessments of credit record management and the number of reported behaviors that would negatively affect aspects of a Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Findings The authors find that respondents with credit record overconfidence have over two times higher odds (123.9%) of using AFS than the odds of respondents with financial knowledge overconfidence (46.8%), relative to their reference categories. When compared directly, those with only credit record overconfidence have 32.6% higher odds of using AFS than those with only financial knowledge overconfidence. Practical implications The results provide implications for education programs, not only for vulnerable groups at higher risk for AFS use but also for those with cognitive biases, such as credit record overconfidence. Potential solutions include personal financial education that includes debiasing and behavioral techniques for overconfidence. Originality/value This paper studies, for the first time, the effect of deviations between actual and perceived credit record management on AFS use.

TI  - Historical legacies in savings: Evidence from Romania
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS
AB  - This study explores channels of savings persistence using a spatial regression discontinuity across an imperial border in present-day Romania. With data obtained from a lab in the field experiment and household survey, the findings suggest that imperial history influences savings behaviors today. I find no evidence that economic preferences for risk and time differ across the border, nor that these preferences are culturally transmitted. Rather, imperial history is strongly correlated with current financial access and asset choice, which affect savings accumulation. To confirm the robustness of these findings, I conduct falsification tests that arbitrarily move the border and also rule out several alternative mechanisms, including trust in financial institutions, financial literacy, and migration. I establish the external validity of the field experiment using nationally-representative data, which also suggests that savings legacies have important welfare consequences for the ability to mitigate household shocks. These findings highlight the role of history in under-saving, as well as the reinforcing nature of culture and institutions in shaping contemporary economic outcomes.

TI  - Depositors' trust: Some empirical evidence from Indonesia
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - We develop a comprehensive index, based on Robbins and Judge's (2008) five dimensions of trust, to measure depositors' trust in individual banks as well as trust in the banking industry and financial safety net. Using a survey of 992 retail depositors in Indonesia, we find that trust in individual banks where depositors save their money is greater than trust in the overall banking industry and financial safety net. We also find that depositors' trust is affected by personal characteristics-for instance, women and older depositors have relatively less trust. Depositors tend to put their trust in individual banks and the financial system if they have greater trust in information conveyed by the government. Religious and economic values have positive effects on depositors' trust at both the micro and macro levels. Our results also document that risk-taking behavior is positively associated with depositors' trust. Furthermore, we find that more-educated depositors have significantly less trust. This finding might imply that the erosion of market discipline by depositors in a country with relatively generous deposit insurance, such as Indonesia, can be mitigated through greater financial literacy.

TI  - Going green? On the drivers of individuals' green bank adoption
T2  - BUSINESS ETHICS THE ENVIRONMENT & RESPONSIBILITY
AB  - In a context where individuals are increasingly more sensitive to corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and where mobilization of savings for the energy transition is essential, our article is the first to study the drivers of online green bank adoption. By analyzing 1075 questionnaires from a panel of French individuals in charge of financial decisions in their households, we show that altruism and green consumption values are significant drivers of individuals' green banking adoption and reveal that willingness to adopt a green bank is mediated by the preference for green savings. These results extend the nascent literature dealing with the link between responsible consumption and saving behaviors. Briefly speaking, green banks (and associated savings products) have the potential to enable households to express their consumption values through their investments. That said, our results suggest that households' financial well-being and financial literacy can be barriers to the mobilization of green savings. Our results also demonstrate the significant influence of information system variables, such as personal innovativeness and trust, on willingness to adopt green banking. By shedding light on the drivers of individuals' green bank adoption, our results provide valuable insights for the banking industry.

TI  - Determinants of financial inclusion gaps in Pakistan and implications for achieving SDGs
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - This study investigates the determinants of gender disparities in financial inclusion in Pakistan using Global Findex 2021 survey data. We aim to quantify gender gaps in financial access and use, and to analyze the socio-economic factors influencing these disparities. Grounded in Sen's capability approach and behavioral economics, we employ logistic regression to examine how gender influences the ownership and usage of financial products. Our results reveal significant gender gaps: only 13% of Pakistani women have financial accounts compared to 34% of men, with similar disparities in digital finance. Socio-economic variables like education, income, and employment are found to influence financial inclusion differently for men and women. While generally supportive of financial inclusion, these factors have a weaker effect for women, suggesting deeper societal barriers. This study adds to the global financial inclusion discourse by providing a comprehensive analysis of gender disparities in Pakistan. Our findings highlight the need for gender-sensitive policies that address these disparities to achieve Sustainable Development Goals related to gender equality and economic empowerment.

TI  - Cross-cultural study the macro variables and its impact on exchange rate regimes
T2  - FUTURE BUSINESS JOURNAL
AB  - This is an empirical analysis of study simultaneously focus on examining the impact of macroeconomic variables, i.e., GDP growth, GDP per capita, inflation, foreign direct investment, exports, imports, interest rates, foreign debt and foreign reserves on the exchange rate regimes, using the sample of five countries from MSCI developed markets index, emerging markets index and frontier markets index each from 1970 to 2020. This study predicts and provides several essential contributions for markets, financial and economic, that fills the gaps in the markets economic and financial literacy of desired countries. The study identifies and evaluates the impact using the most advanced statistical frameworks. This study adopts ML-binary logit (quadratic hill climbing) and investigates the change in the exchange rate regimes due to macroeconomic variables. The empirical results confirm that Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore markets take timely correct exchange rate regimes decisions, which lead to developed markets. As emerging markets and frontier markets never adopt the exchange rate regimes three, four, and six, which is a significant impact factor that affects those markets never growth according develops markets. Foreign debts, inflation and foreign reserves are severe challenges for emerging and frontier markets.

TI  - "Maxed Out on Efficiency": Logger Perceptions of Financial Challenges Facing Timber Operations
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - Loggers play critical roles in forest management and resource production, yet supply chain pressures can challenge their economic sustainability. We examine logger perspectives on efficiency, financial challenges, and potential solutions from two contrasting perspectives: 1) business strategy and 2) treadmill of production, a sociological critique of resource production that links economic and ecological sustainability. To provide in-depth perspectives based on lived experiences, we conducted interviews with professional loggers and other stakeholders, focusing on firms with mechanized cut-to-length systems in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Our qualitative analysis revealed the intersection of factors that help explain financial stress. Loggers work on contract or buy stumpage from landowners and then sell to mills. Perceived challenges included competition in stumpage markets, relationships to mills that disadvantaged small firms, debt from mechanization, and site access through variable environmental conditions. Loggers worked to increase efficiency and production volume, though some loggers expressed the limits of increasing efficiency and production for improving profitability. Proposed solutions to reduce financial stress included long-term mill contracts, access to loans, and improved financial literacy. Nonetheless, individual firm efficiency will not address structural challenges such as loggers' role in the supply chain between landowners and mills.

TI  - Demographic and Socio-economic Factors Influencing Households & Investment Choices in Tanzania
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper primarily aims to determine the demographic and socio-economic characteristics affecting households' investment choices in Tanzania using data from the FinScope survey which was done in 2017. The study employed multivariate analytical technique. The results of the paper reveal that increase in education level lowers the likelihood of individual household to invest in informal groups as well as agricultural ventures. Also, the study shows that men are more risk averse and less likely to invest in the informal groups, investment accounts as well as personal businesses. It is also revealed that urban households may easily access financial products due to the presence of a good number of financial institutions located in urban compared to rural areas, and that urban households rarely participate in agricultural activities due to lack of enough land in townships. Finally, the paper confirms that employed households are more likely to make a good financial decision because most of them are believed to have good education which enable them to access formal financial literacy education. Consequently, the study opines that, because most of households, as revealed in the survey from which the employed dataset is based, are hailing from rural settings where agriculture is the main economic activity, we establish that agricultural ventures require a complete revamp for Tanzania to become a middle-income economy through its industrialization agenda.

TI  - Asset Accumulation and Housing Cost Burden: Pathways to (Not) Saving
T2  - HOUSING POLICY DEBATE
AB  - Asset accumulation is especially challenging for low- and moderate-income households, which often face fixed costs in their budgets that limit their ability to save. Key fixed costs include expenses associated with housing, such as rent, mortgage, taxes, and utilities. In 2011, 64% of households making $15,000-29,999 were cost-burdened (spent 30% or more of their income on housing). Data were collected in 2007 at two sites using a mixed-methods approach. A sample of 175 households were examined to determine how certain low- and moderate-income households with varying levels of cost burden managed to build savings and why others struggled with the same goal. Households with savings above the sample median of $112 saved an average of $2,304 (with a median of $803). Households with savings below the group's median had an average of $13 in savings, with a median of zero. Barriers to saving experienced by our asset-challenged households include unpredicted shocks, low incomes, unemployment and chronic sickness, large debt, multiple dependents, and prioritizing human capital investments and consumption over saving. Pathways to savings include coresidence, sharing business profits based on need, and financial assistance without obligation of repayment. Other pathways include financial literacy about budgets, savings, and other investments.

T2  - NMIMS MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Purpose: This research is an attempt to assess the current state of financial inclusion empirically, its significance and impact in the Indian context.
   Methodology: The present study examines the impact of financial inclusion on the economic growth of India. A multiple regression model was developed based on secondary data from 2010-11 to 2019-20.
   Findings: The results of the study found a positive as well as a significant impact on the total number of transactions through ICT-A/Cs-BC and the number of basic saving bank deposit account (BSBDA) on the GDP of India. Hence, the study concludes that financial inclusion has a significant impact on the growth of the Indian economy.
   Practical Implications: The concept of financial inclusion in the context of macroeconomics gives researcher innumerable opportunities to explore. The paper allows future researchers an opportunity to study the change in financial behaviour of the people after being financially included, to discuss the technicalities and dynamics of our financial inclusion indicators, and to suggest policymaking that may align for successful implementation of financial literacy,
   Originality/Value: Financial inclusion aims to include each individual in the financial framework of the country. It focuses on the accessibility and affordability of banking services for everyone irrespective of their financial status. This study by and large analyses the quantitative aspects of financial inclusion, its impact and significance on the Indian economy from the empirical research point of view.

TI  - Farmers' adoption of digital technology and agricultural entrepreneurial willingness: Evidence from China
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - Agricultural entrepreneurship significantly improves farmers' livelihoods and it also contributes toward poverty reduction. In the present study, we used the data of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS 2019) as a sample, and empirically examined the dynamic linkages between adoption of digital technology (ADT) and farmers' agricultural entrepreneurial willingness (AEW). The findings of this study reveal that (1) the ADT significantly improved farmers' AEW by 18.5%; (2) the ADT more significantly affected the entrepreneurial willingness of farmers who live in less developed rural areas, or who preference for risk, or whose households have not been affected by major adverse events, or who belong to the rural elite; (3) digital financial participation plays a partial mediating effect of 11.7% in the effect of the ADT on farmers' AEW, with financial literacy and subjective well-being having moderating effects and reinforcing the effect of the ADT on farmers' AEW. Finally, we put forward several policy recommendations, such as narrowing the 'three-level digital divide', improving digital human capital, and developing digital inclusive finance to provide new ideas for farmer entrepreneurship, to enhance farmer's livelihood and to promote rural economic development.

TI  - My new financial companion! non-linear understanding of Robo-advisory service acceptance
T2  - SERVICE INDUSTRIES JOURNAL
AB  - Robo-advisory services are gaining traction and could usher in the next cycle of disruptive change in the financial services industry. Yet, many are reticent to embrace this service innovation for their wealth management. This study probes this phenomenon by examining the interplay among technology characteristics (i.e. performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and perceived security), human-like characteristics (i.e. perceived autonomy, perceived intelligence, and perceived anthropomorphism), and consumer characteristics (i.e. financial literacy and affinity for technology interaction) to explain the acceptance of robo-advisory services. For this purpose, a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis and an artificial neural network analysis were performed to uncover the interdependency and complexity of the proposed variables, based on 375 responses collected through a large consumer panel survey in China. The findings revealed the presence of six configurations conducive for high acceptance of robo-advisory services, with perceived anthropomorphism and a combination of perceived effort expectancy and perceived security identified as core conditions. Moreover, according to the artificial neural network analysis, perceived intelligence is the most important determinant of robo-advisory service acceptance. This study challenges the conventional linear and symmetric perspective adopted in prior research.

TI  - Next-gen precarity: gender and informal labor in the Eastern Himalaya
T2  - GENDER TECHNOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In the eastern Himalayan region of Sikkim and Darjeeling, India, young women migrate from within and outside the area to work in the expanding retail and service sector. This sector demands very little from them in terms of education, technical skills or financial literacy; the emphasis being on their youth, and supposed socio-cultural and gendered attributes of docility, flexibility and manageability. Simultaneously, technological and infrastructural advancements combined with the influx of cheap fakes of international brands have made borderlands prominent sites of low-end globalization. The informal sector thrives on the back of this rapidly expanding market, the unceasing supply of cheap, flexible and docile labor and the invisibility of laboring bodies and their inherent precarity. However, the informal sector and the attributes that it seeks also create room to maneuver, and negotiate precarity. Focusing on this newly formed but rapidly growing precariat in the eastern Himalayan borderland, and using qualitative data, this paper illustrates (a) how capitalism, through consumption, can create precarious lives and livelihoods (b) the emerging contradictions (empowerment, exploitation) in social and gendered relations as a result of informal employment and (c) the transformation of borderlands into new sites of low-end globalization.

TI  - Frugality Is Hard to Afford
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
AB  - Intertemporal savings strategies, such as bulk buying or accelerating purchase timing to take advantage of a good deal, provide long-term savings in exchange for an increase in immediate spending. Although households with limited financial resources stand to benefit the most from these strategies, they are less likely to make use of them. The authors provide causal evidence that liquidity constraints impede low-income households' ability to use these strategies, above and beyond the impact of other constraints. Exploiting recurring variation in household liquidity, this study shows that when low-income households have more liquidity, they partially catch up to higher-income households' ability to use intertemporal savings strategies. The findings provide guidance to marketing managers and researchers regarding targeted promotional design and measurement of deal-proneness. For policy makers, they suggest a new path for decreasing the higher prices low-income households have been documented to pay for everyday goods. Policies have traditionally focused on increasing financial literacy or access to supermarkets. Our work suggests that providing greater liquidity can help low-income households make better use of savings opportunities already available to them.

TI  - Money attitudes, financial capabilities, and impulsiveness as predictors of wealth accumulation
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In this study we examined three correlates of personal wealth-financial capability, buying impulsiveness, and attitudes to money in a large UK adult sample (N = 90,184). We were interested in how these psychological variables related to personal wealth controlling for well-established demographic correlates: age, education, gender, and household income. We drew on three personal wealth variables based on savings and investments, property wealth and personal items. Using correlational and regression analysis we tested three specific hypotheses which each received support. Our variables accounted for around half the variance with respect to property value, and two thirds with respect to investments. The hierarchical regression onto the savings and investment factor showed two thirds of the variance was accounted for: the demographic variables accounted for 27% of the variance, money attitudes an additional 14%; financial capability an additional 24% and buying impulsivity no additional variance. Age, income, and planning ahead were the most powerful and consistent predictors of wealth variables, with associating money with security as an important predictor for savings and investments. Implications for helping improve financial literacy and capability are noted. Limitations are acknowledged.

TI  - Marketing bank services to financially vulnerable customers: evidence from an emerging economy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore how banks in Nigeria are marketing financial services to financially vulnerable customers. Design/methodology/approach A multiple case study research strategy was used to analyse three commercial banks and two microfinance banks. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with the banks' directors as well as from banks' published annual reports and archival images. Findings The study reveals that Nigerian banks develop different product development portfolios, adopt innovative traditional marketing schemes and apply inclusive technologies to reach and extend services to the unbanked and financially vulnerable customers in the society. Research limitations/implications Banks should focus on consumer engagement through the proactive development of technologies and employ innovative marketing methods. Customers' banking experiences can be enhanced if banks communicate with and educate customers about technological modes of engagement. In addition, financial service transaction support and financial literacy education can assist banks in marketing their services to financially vulnerable customers, in mutually beneficial ways. Originality/value This study shows how financial service operators' market and extend their services to financially vulnerable customers in emerging markets. It empirically establishes the importance of financial services to financially excluded customers.

TI  - Social Capital and Stock Market Participation via Technologies: The Role of Households' Risk Attitude and Cognitive Ability
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This article reviews the relation between social capital and stock market participation via new technology. Its purpose is to acquire a thorough understanding of the structural, relational, and cognitive aspects of social capital's influences and to recommend further empirical research ideas to the existing body of knowledge on household finance. It discusses the consideration of modern and highly technological platforms such as the internet stock market exchange platforms and applications. The stock market participation puzzle remains unsolved despite the progress in explaining the economic rationality behind investors decision making through behavioral finance. Furthermore, the researchers develop four propositions which can expound the existing relationship between social capital dimensions such as the structural, relational, and cognitive aspects and stock market participation of households. Doing so, we discuss the roles of risk attitude and the influence of cognitive ability such as financial awareness, financial literacy, and IQ (intelligence quotient) to enhance the existing body of knowledge. Practically, this article adds valuable ideas in solving the issue of limited participation not just in the stock market but in other financial markets through reflecting on the sociological and (green) technological concepts. Lastly, the implications for sustainable financial markets are elaborated.

TI  - The Impact of Perceived Risk and Trust on Adoption of Mobile Money Services: An Empirical Study in Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - In Pakistan, usage of mobile money services is very poor due to several reasons including lack of understanding of services, low financial literacy rate, and fear of losing their hard-earned money. Moreover, the association between perceived risk, perceived trust, and mobile money adoption has not yet been examined comprehensively. Therefore, this study aims to assess the impact of perceived risk and perceived trust on the adoption of mobile money services in Pakistan. This study carried out a cross-sectional survey using a standardized questionnaire to collect primary data from the mobile money users in the Punjab Province, Pakistan. Smart-PLS Algorithm and bootstrapping method were employed to analyze the data. The study found that three dimensions of perceived risk, namely, security risk, privacy risk, and financial risk have a significant impact on adoption of mobile money services in Pakistan. Perceived trust was also found to be a significant factor for mobile money adoption in the country. Moreover, the respondents reported that mobile money services save their time and reduce costs in performing financial transactions. The empirical findings of the study might be useful for the policymakers and service providers in enhancing the usage of mobile money services among financially-excluded segments of society.

TI  - Prudent Financial Management Practices among Malaysian Youth: The Moderating Roles of Financial Education
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The study aims to investigate the roles of financial education (FE) as a moderator to financial attitude (FA), parental financial socialisation (PFS), and financial literacy (FL) to ensure the success of prudent financial management practices (PFMP) among Malaysian youth. The study was designed quantitatively and employed self-administered questionnaires, which were adopted from previous studies and distributed to 480 youths in Malaysia. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test hypotheses of the study. The results showed FA, PFS and FL have significant and positive relationship with PFMP. However, as regards moderating interaction of FE, results showed that FE does not significantly moderate the relationship between FA, PFS and FL with PFMP. The results further highlighted serious concerns on the effectiveness of FE towards improving youth capability in managing their financial affairs prudently. This proved that mandated FE prior to graduation has less effect and does not lead to behavior changes among Malaysian youth. It shows the challenges faced by the country stakeholders to strengthen FE, enhance the effectiveness and encompass the right FE elements to ensure today's young Malaysians are able to apply what they learned in the classroom to their real life.

TI  - Are Credit-Based Internet Consumer Finance Platforms Sustainable? A Study on Continuous Use Intention of Chinese Users
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Internet consumer finance platforms (ICFPs), as a new Internet financial model, have emerged and been widely adopted by Chinese as well as global online shoppers following the rapid growth of e-commerce. This emerging financial tool is, however, luring younger generations deep into debt. It jeopardizes the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1-No poverty, bringing the sustainability of this consumer financial model into question. To aid the sustainable development of ICFP industry, this paper distinguishes two antecedents of continuous use intention for ICFP users: (1) satisfaction, as a sustainable determinant; and (2) impulsive buying, as a non-sustainable determinant. We found satisfaction (b = 0.452) has a larger positive effect on continuous use intention compared to impulsive buying (b = 0.229). Therefore, ICFPs should weigh heavier on technology innovation instead of seducing consumers' impulsive buying behavior. We also found that credit limit misconception poses the largest impact (b = 0.483) on impulsive buying. In the near term, governments and ICFPs may initiate public programs to improve ICFP users' financial literacy in order to restrain their unsustainable impulsive buying behavior and cultivate their sustainable satisfaction on ICFP technology and service. Market regulators may build up institutional frameworks to tighten the abuse of financial platforms on credit issuing power and better foster sustainable entrepreneurship in this new financial platform business.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) by integrating FinTech with the the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). By focusing on three dimensions (inclusive finance, economy, and environment), we identify how FinTech may influence sustainable development. We innovate using human- and machine-generated processing to develop themes, making systematic literature reviews more objective and advancing replicability and reproducibility. This study demonstrates the contribution of FinTech in expanding the investment opportunity set by including environmental projects and increasing the diversity and participation rates of savers and lenders. Through this process, FinTech increases its market completeness. Accordingly, FinTech can increase economic growth by achieving higher productivity and sustainable growth through diversification, technological upgrades, entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation. Additionally, FinTech can accelerate investments in poverty eradication and reduce income inequality. These contributions are aligned with specific SDGs and show that FinTech is an appropriate new technology for financial services.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - The main aim of this study is to explore the probable impact of audit committee investigation uses a sample of 281 listed firms in the six GCC countries representing 1124 firm-year observations for a period of four financial periods (2019-2022). Findings from both Hierarchical Multiple Regression models suggest that only two out of four independent variables (AC independence and AC financial expertise) explain the firm performance of listed firms in GCC countries. This study makes a valuable contribution to the existing literature by offering a comprehensive analysis of the influence of AC existence and its specific features on firm performance, drawing insights from agency theory and resource dependence theory. By examining these relationships, the study enhances our understanding of the mechanisms through which AC characteristics can impact a firm's success. The findings of this study hold practical implications for businesses and investors. By understanding the impact of AC characteristics on firm performance, businesses can make informed decisions when structuring their audit committees. They can prioritize specific features or attributes that have been found to positively influence firm performance, such as independence, expertise, and financial literacy of AC members. This knowledge can guide businesses in optimizing their governance structures and enhancing their overall performance. The results can be used as a guide by governments and other regulatory bodies for drafting rules pertaining to corporate governance (CG) codes, particularly those that deal with AC creation.

Findings Financial and numerical skills could play a significant role in boosting entrepreneurial culture, overcoming reticence and increasing awareness of business opportunities, particularly when women are motivated to increase their autonomy and income. The study offers meaningful implications for policymakers. Research limitations/implications Further research will be needed before these conclusions may be inferred to other settings and circumstances. Comparison with a similar sample of potential male entrepreneurs may also be necessary to deduce the influence of gender. Practical implications The introduction of certain financial content into the education system by governments and policymakers would produce remarkable results on entrepreneurship intention among women. Social implications Relational capital and positive social influences also contribute to mitigating the effects of risk aversion, one of the main barriers for potential female entrepreneurs. Originality/value The role of financial literacy in entrepreneurial intention among women has scarcely been addressed in academic research. The literature also has paid little attention to the analysis of what motivates women into entrepreneurship, and whether women who decide to embark on a business venture show different profiles. The aim of this study is to contribute to closing these gaps, exploring the effect of cognitive skills, personality traits, contextual factors and motivations.

TI  - Analysis of rural women's access to financial services and corporate social responsibility in Nigeria's Niger delta region
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives of multinational oil companies (MOCs) in Nigeria. Its special focus is to investigate the impact of the global memorandum of understanding (GMoU) on enhancing rural women's financial inclusion in the areas of access to credit, insurance, propensity of women to save and the widening of economic opportunities in the Niger Delta. A total of 800 rural women were sampled across the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Results from the use of a combined propensity score matching and logit model indicate that the GMoU model has made significant impact on closing the gaps in financial services, thereby removing women's constraints on their efforts to enhance their financial literacy. The results also confirm that innovative delivery channels and social networks of the GMoUs have reduced some costs in the areas of access to credit, insurance, propensity to save and the widening of economic opportunities of rural women in the oil host communities. However, a further look at the rural women's participation in the CSR activities using SCOTDI shows that even though the involvement of the women is appreciable, it is insignificant when compared with their male counterparts.

TI  - The Roles of FinTech with Perceived Mediators in Consumer Financial Satisfaction with Cashless Payments
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the association between FinTech payments and consumer financial satisfaction with cashless payments using data from the 2017 China Household Finance Survey. This study defines computer payment and mobile terminal payment using a cell phone or pad as payments with FinTech. The results indicate that payments with FinTech are positively associated with financial satisfaction with cashless payments. Furthermore, this result holds in the eastern and central groups of China, but not in the western group, where payments with FinTech are not associated with financial satisfaction with cashless payments. Similarly, the positive association does not hold for consumers with low financial literacy. Moreover, analyses on the mediating effects imply that payments with FinTech play roles through three perceived mediators. Specifically, payments with FinTech help increase consumers' perceived convenience and perceived popularity as well as reduce perceived risk, which eventually improves financial satisfaction with cashless payments. These findings have implications for consumer policymakers, such as improving the development of FinTech, noticing the heterogeneity in terms of location, and guiding consumers to correctly understand the risks associated with FinTech. Surrounding this issue, future studies may also explore other mediators related to psychology and expand the connotation of Fintech from payments with FinTech to lending and portfolio investments with FinTech.

TI  - Financial inclusion toward economic inclusion: empirical evidence from China's rural household
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - PurposeFocusing on micro-level indicators, we investigate financial inclusion levels in rural China, examining its determinants and impact on household welfare. We construct a financial inclusion index of four essential financial services: savings, digital payments, credit and insurance. We identify factors influencing financial inclusion among Chinese rural households and assess the effects of financial inclusion on household welfare.Design/methodology/approachWith the entropy method, we use data from the 2019 China Household Finance Survey to assess financial inclusion levels in rural China. Determinants and their impact on welfare are analyzed through probit and ordinary least squares models, respectively. Propensity scoring matching is applied to address potential endogeneity.FindingsWe reveal that rural households exhibit limited usage of formal financial services, with notable regional disparities. The eastern region enjoys the highest financial inclusion and the central region lags behind. Household characteristics such as family size, education level of the household head, income, employment status and financial literacy significantly influence financial inclusion. Financial inclusion positively impacts household welfare as indicated by household consumption expenditure. The use of different types of financial services is crucial with varying but significant effects on household welfare.Originality/valueThis study offers valuable insights into China's rural financial inclusion progress, highlighting potential barriers and guiding government actions.

TI  - Navigating the digital financial landscape: unraveling the impact of financial behavior traits on women-owned enterprises in the new normal perspective
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Exploring the financial behavior traits amidst the unexpected financial challenges and the unparalleled rise in fintech, this study provides insight into the interplay of entrepreneur digital financial literacy (EDFL), entrepreneur financial competency (EFC), and entrepreneur financial skill (EFS) impacting entrepreneur financial decision-making (EFDM). Toward this goal, data were gathered from 223 active women entrepreneurs from India who have accounts in the social media platform. The three-step hierarchical regression analysis disclosed that an entrepreneur with sound EDFL, EFS, and EFC can significantly enhance strategic decision-making (EFDM). The research outcome reveals that EFDM is a consistent predictor of the financial performance of women-owned enterprises. In addition, the entrepreneur's financial decision-making does not mediate the relationship between financial experience, financial competency, financial skill budgeting, and financial skill_acumen with financial performance. In contrast, partial mediation is observed between digital financial awareness, digital financial knowledge, and financial skill_analytics. The novel insight accounted for a significantly low level of experience in entrepreneurs' utilization of digital platforms for payment, financing loans, and asset management. The outcome carries academic, regulatory, and managerial significance, recognizing the unique interaction; the cumulative efforts strengthen the capacity to address socio-economic challenges and translate them into gender-specific policy interventions and practices.

TI  - The Determinants of Accessibility of Financial Services in Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The study aims to assess the impact of factors on the access to financial services by Vietnamese farmers. The number of respondents in this study is 402 household heads participating in six diverse agricultural value chains in Vietnam. The explanatory variables of the Multinomial Logit model estimates variables at the individual characteristics while the Mixed Logit model can combine the two types of variables together to estimate the effects simultaneously. On the other hand, the Ordinal Logit model is used to evaluate the determinants of the increase in the quantity of financial services used by individuals. The estimation results show that male-headed households have more access to financial services than females. Younger farmers are more likely to use formal financial services than the elderly. Financial literacy, land ownership, and shocks in agricultural production all have a positive impact on the probability of dealing with banks. In addition, the degree of linkage and credibility of the value chain have a significant positive impact on the accessibility of financial services to farmers. The findings of this study suggest that limiting gender inequality, focusing on youth marketing and developing agricultural value chains will have a positive impact on farmers' access to financial services.

TI  - Literacies in everyday life: Tattoo information needs
T2  - EDUCATION FOR INFORMATION
CP  - LIBRARIES IN THE DIGITAL AGE (LIDA)
AB  - This paper identifies the information needs of individuals in the process of tattoo acquisition and discusses those needs in relation to information literacy skills that support tattoo information experience. Findings of 21 interviews with participants in Aotearoa New Zealand show that for a successful tattoo information experience, people need to engage with information to find a tattoo image, select and communicate their needs and negotiate with artists, mitigate health and safety risks, understand tattoo-related rights and appropriateness, capture and share their experience, and present their identity in social settings. Seven categories of information needs emerged supported by accompanying literacies under the overarching category of Information Needs (Information Literacy): Health Information Needs (Health Literacy), Visual Information Needs (Visual Literacy), Legal Information Needs (Legal Literacy), Cultural Information Needs (Cultural Literacy), Societal Information Needs (Societal Literacy), Digital and Media Information Needs (Digital and Media Literacy). Although just briefly mentioned by our participants, there was an indication of Financial Information Needs (Financial Literacy). Information literacy in the workplace and formal learning contexts has been well-researched. Still, there is an opportunity to focus more on literacies in everyday life, and tattoos present such an opportunity with significant contribution to individuals, tattoo artists and communities.

TI  - Mobile payment use and payment satisfaction: mediation and moderation analyses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeWith the development of financial technology (FinTech), this paper aims to investigate the association between mobile payment use and payment satisfaction using data from the 2017 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS).Design/methodology/approachThis study uses ordered probit regressions to examine the association between mobile payments and payment satisfaction because the dependent variable is ordinal. To alleviate endogeneity problems, this study uses instrument variables and Heckman's two-step estimation. Furthermore, to explore the potential mediators in this process, this study follows the three steps suggested by Baron and Kenny (1986). Finally, this study divides the whole sample into subsamples to examine whether the association between mobile payments and payment satisfaction differs in diverse groups.FindingsThe results indicate that mobile payment use is positively associated with payment satisfaction. Moreover, mediation analyses imply that mobile payment use may help increase consumers' credit availability, which eventually improves payment satisfaction. Three moderators of this association are financial literacy, expenditure level and portfolio diversification, which enhance the positive association between mobile payment use and payment satisfaction.Originality/valueThis study explores the potential mediators between mobile payment use and payment satisfaction, which is beneficial to comprehensively understanding various pathways of this process. Moreover, this study conducts heterogeneous analyses to investigate whether associations between mobile payments and payment satisfaction are moderated by various factors, which will allow policymakers to formulate policies appropriate for specific situations of diverse consumer groups.

TI  - Donald Duck: a narrative that embeds behavioral finance?
T2  - STUDIES IN ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to prove that narratives can be a adequate foundation for human behavior in general and economic behavior in particular using the Donald Duck universe as an example. Design/methodology/approach By using a content analysis, the authors examine 208 stories of the Donald Duck universe to prove that economic behavior is already embedded in modern narratives of the 20th century. Findings This analysis shows that behavioral finance effects are identified in a total of 52.4% of the analyzed comics. This study furthermore distinguishes the main comic characters Donald Duck and Scrooge McDuck and finds that eight of the nine considered behavioral finance biases can be detected in both. The most striking effect for Donald Duck is overconfidence and for Uncle Scrooge loss aversion. Social implications Collectively, these comics provide potential exemplars for behavioral finance. Regardless of whether these comics depict human nature or merely reflect human behavior during that time, they inevitably contribute to the understanding that psychological and sociological influences determine behavior in addition to economic factors that can be used for academic teaching. Originality/value In summary, comics, such as the Donald Duck universe, are suitable narratives for behavioral finance.

TI  - 'When my husband died, I collected debt of N20,000……were going to take me to the court, but since the money came, I have cleared my debt and bought cattle': intended and unintended socioeconomic impact of cash transfer program in Nigeria
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - The Nigerian government commenced large scale cash transfer program in 2017. We evaluated the socioeconomic impact of the cash transfer program (CTP) in Nigeria. Across six randomly selected states that had implemented the CTP for at least six months, qualitative inquiries were conducted among beneficiaries and program implementers. We utilized a program impact theory to explore the interaction of cash transfer on socioeconomic outcomes. Data were analysed using deductive and inductive thematic analysis. The CTP in Nigeria showed positive impact on reduction of poverty through new income generation or expansion of existing businesses. Food security was improved by promoting increased food expenditure. CTP increased utilization of health services including facility delivery of pregnancies. The CTP also promoted education by increasing attendance at school while also promoting opportunities for savings and investments. Though the majority of the beneficiaries were women, expenditure decision making on the cash was by men and in a few cases jointly. With the large number of poor and vulnerable persons in Nigeria the findings of the CTP in Nigeria show promise in improving key socioeconomic outcomes across poverty, health and nutrition, education, savings, and investment. Our findings justify the need for expansion of the CTP to more poor and vulnerable households. CTPs in Nigeria should consider implementing educational programs to enhance women's financial literacy or adjusting the structure of the CTPs to incentivize shared decision-making. Future studies on CTP and its socioeconomic impact should include key metrics to measure the size of the impact.

TI  - Agents of alienation: accountants and the land grab of Papua New Guinea
T2  - ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore and examine the role of accounting and accountants in customary land transactions between Indigenous peoples and foreign corporate entities. The paper uses the case of two accountants who utilised accounting technologies in lease agreements to alienate customary land from Indigenous landowners in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Design/methodology/approach Employing a case study methodology, the paper draws on contemporary data sets of transcripts related to a Commission of Inquiry established in 2011 to investigate PNG's Special Agricultural Business Lease system. Analysis of other publicly available data and semi-structured interviews with PNG landowners and other stakeholders supplement and triangulate data from the inquiry transcripts. A Bourdieusian lens was adopted to conceptualise how accounting was used in the struggles for customary land between foreign developers and Indigenous landowners within the wider capitalist field and the traditional Melanesian field. Findings This paper reveals how accountants exploited PNG's customary land registration system, the Indigenous peoples' lack of financial literacy and their desperation for development to alienate customary land from landowners. The accountants employed accounting technologies in the sublease agreements to reduce their royalty obligations to the landowners and to impose penalty clauses that made it financially impossible for the landowners to cancel the leases. The accountants used accounting to normalise, legitimise and rationalise these exploitative arrangements in formal lease contracts. Originality/value This paper responds to the call for research on accounting and Indigenous peoples that is contemporary rather than historic; examines the role of accountants in Indigenous relations, and examines the emancipatory potential of accounting.

TI  - A case study of a pilot leadership skills program to clarify professional fulfillment sources for academic physicians
T2  - LEADERSHIP IN HEALTH SERVICES
AB  - PurposeIn this case study, the authors aimed to investigate the usefulness of five interactive workshops on leadership skills relevant to academic physicians for their professional fulfillment. Workshops were led by experts in finance, negotiation, business administration and digital tools and enhanced a practical understanding of skills in 1) financial investment; 2) growing clout on social media; 3) negotiation; 4) navigating institutional culture as a woman; and 5) conflict management.Design/methodology/approachWorkshops were deployed to faculty in the departments of Radiology and Psychiatry. Attendance at seminars was captured, categorized as in-person (when offered), virtual-live or virtual-recording views post hoc. The authors also collected responses to a brief, 5-question survey which assessed faculty familiarity with the topic pre-and post-seminar and evaluated the perceived relevance of the topic to professional fulfillment.FindingsThe highest attendance was for the seminar on financial investments, and the lowest attendance was for that on conflict management. The seminar that the highest proportion of respondents deemed important as a leadership skill was on the topic of navigating institutional culture as a woman in the workplace. The seminar that focused on cultivating clout on social media was the seminar that the highest proportion of respondents deemed worth attending.Originality/valueFrom this case study, the authors learned that financial literacy, discerning institutional culture, managing conflicts, negotiating and using digital tools are topics which have relevance to physician professional fulfillment. Such topics could be valuable as the building blocks for future programs which provide leadership training to physicians.

TI  - Analysis of Financially Aware Consumer Segments from the Perspective of Conscious Consumer Behaviour
T2  - ACTA POLYTECHNICA HUNGARICA
AB  - Changes in production and consumption are necessary to address global environmental concerns. The consumer market is dynamic and constantly changing. The analysis of consumer patterns, preferences and attitudes, and the monitoring of changes in consumer decisions is of key importance for all professionals with a market -oriented approach. In this paper, I analyse the characteristics of the conscious consumer, including the financially aware consumer, from the perspective of consumer trends. In addition to being fully educated, consciousness also refers to a complex pattern of behaviour that includes both values and actions. After presenting the theoretical insights based on secondary data, I also provide a thorough analysis of the topic of financial awareness using data from quantitative primary research. As a result of, a self-administered survey with 3,515 evaluable responses, well-differentiated segments of the population in terms of financial awareness were characterised. The findings provide statistical evidence of a link between financial awareness and financial and economic knowledge. I believe that the results will be beneficial for educational institutions, which play a key role in imparting financial and economic knowledge, and for organisations involved in improving financial literacy and in identifying the primary target groups, as well as for opinion leaders. Additionally, the results also serve as a basis for further potential opportunities for raising and expanding financial awareness among consumers.

TI  - Quality financial inclusion and its determinants in South Africa: evidence from survey data
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - Purpose The study measured quality financial inclusion, a more comprehensive measure of financial inclusion, and examined its determinants at a consumer level in South Africa. Design/methodology/approach This study leveraged on FinScope 2015 survey data to compute a quality financial inclusion index using polychoric principal component analysis. Subsequently, a heteroscedasticity consistent ordinary least squares regression model was employed to assess determinants of quality financial inclusion. Findings The empirical findings indicated that gender, education, financial literacy, income, location and geographical proximity determine quality financial inclusion. These findings could inform policymakers and financial services providers on how quality financial inclusion can be promoted through tailoring financial products for various socio-demographic groups. Research limitations/implications Due to data limitations, the study was confined to South Africa and did not capture digital financial inclusion. Hence, future studies could replicate the study in Sub-Saharan Africa's context and compute an index that captures digital financial inclusion. Practical implications These findings could inform policymakers and financial services providers on how quality financial inclusion can be promoted through tailoring financial products for various socio-demographic groups. Originality/value This study proposed a more comprehensive measure of quality financial inclusion from a demand-side perspective by accounting for important dimensions that include diversity, affordability, appropriateness and flexibility of financial products and services.

TI  - The differences in the impact of entrepreneurial abilities of various European SMEs on their financial risk perceptions
T2  - ENTREPRENEURIAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS REVIEW
AB  - Objective: The objective of the article is to investigate whether the impact of innovativeness and competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) on their financial risks differ depending on the countries where SMEs are located.
   Research Design & Methods: The researchers created an online questionnaire and gained data from 1221 Czech, Slovak, and Hungarian SMEs. Moreover, the researchers applied ordinal logistic regression analyses to achieve the goal of this study.
   Findings: According to the results, the impact of competitiveness on the bankruptcy risk perception of SMEs differ depending on the countries where they operate. Concerning the impact of innovativeness on financial performance and financial risk management, this article also proves that international differences between SMEs exist.
   Implications & Recommendations: The developments in the financial literacy of company executives and their managerial experiences and the improvements in credit access conditions, intellectual property rights, and tax legislation can make SMEs reduce their concerns about their financial risks. Thus, policymakers' implementations are crucial to providing equal opportunities for SMEs even if they operate in various markets.
   Contribution & Value Added: This current research does not only make international comparisons among the investigated variables but also analyses the impacts of entrepreneurial competencies on various indicators of financial risk. These facts not only make this research become a unique study in the literature but also the reason why it should garner the interest of prospective readers such as policymakers, academicians, and SME owners.

TI  - Overconfidence and the adoption of robo-advice: why overconfident investors drive the expansion of automated financial advice
T2  - FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB  - Adaptive online platforms, powered by artificial intelligence, commonly referred to as robo-advice, steadily increase their market share. Yet these comparably new financial services are critically understudied. Little is known about why some investors adopt robo-advice for something as essential as asset allocation. The current paper tries to close this gap by shedding light on the causal effect of investor overconfidence on the propensity of using robo-advice. The study proposes a theoretical framework that combines the divergence of opinion hypothesis with consumer behavior insights and information technology diffusion research. The framework is empirically tested on the Investor Sample of the 2015 National Financial Capability Study, a subsample of 2000 US investors. The results from a series of generalized linear, structural, and semiparametric models show that in a pre-chasm market, overconfident investors have a significantly higher propensity of adopting robo-advice. While higher financial literacy seems to decrease robo-advice uptake, unjustified confidence in one's knowledge causally increases it. Willingness to take financial risk cannot account for the significantly increased adoption of robo-advice among overconfident investors. The findings help managers to better position robo-advice by offering behavioral insights into their user base. In addition, the results outline a managerial tool to take demand-side actions to increase the likelihood of an end-user innovation crossing the chasm.

TI  - The push for financial inclusion in Africa: Should central banks be wary of political institutional quality and literacy rates?Palabras Clave(sic)(sic)(sic)
T2  - POLITICS & POLICY
AB  - Motivated by the literature on reform complementarities and their importance for the effectiveness of central bank independence (CBI) reforms-particularly for African countries-where CBI has empirically not been found to have a significant impact on financial development, we explore the extent to which differences in literacy levels and political institutions could determine the extent and impact of CBI on financial inclusion. Using panel data from 2004 to 2014, we find that, while CBI does not promote financial inclusion in Africa, financial literacy and political institutions do; even to the extent of enabling CBI's impact on financial inclusion. The results are robust to different measures of political institutions from Freedom House and Polity IV Database and present implications for the role governments could play in shepherding central banks in Africa in the midst of Africa's developmental challenges and the global crises.

TI  - How does the web game design influence the behavior of e-banking users?
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AB  - Gamification has a clear influence on software design, development arid plays an important role in the motivation and intention of users to use a website and buy online. Nevertheless, in the case of e-banking, the influence of gamification in software design and on the user's intention to use are still very unclear. We intend to verify how game design elements and mechanics combined in the design of a bank website, influence the intention of customers to use e-banking. To explore and analyze the effects of gamification on a bank website, we propose a conceptual model considering the interaction between six variables: gamification, ease of use, information, design, web page characteristics, and intention to use the website. To test this model we develop a quantitative study involving 219 bank customers as participants who interacted with a gamified e-banking website to manage their financial investments. Participants then responded to an online questionnaire (including items related to the main variables), in order to measure their reactions to gamified software and their intentions. All data were statistically analyzed and results indicate that gamification has a significant influence on the ease of use and the intention to use e banking, as well as on the web design, information, and webpage characteristics. We find that gamification may motivate customers to use e-banking, and that it improves their financial literacy and facilitates online processes and transactions. This study provides insightful guidelines for web design, development and e-banking contents that can be taken into account by marketing, IT, and business teams working in electronic banks.

TI  - Evolving strategies for improving the performance of farmer producer companies through field studies
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
AB  - Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) were spearheaded for the integration of resource-poor farmers with the market systems in India. However, 45% of the FPCs aged more than five years had become dormant in function. The present study was undertaken to identify, validate and prioritise the strategies which could facilitate the improved performance of FPCs and ensure their sustainability in the long run. The list of strategies was identified through focus group discussions along with personal and telephonic interviews with experts associated with FPCs, viz. FPC officials (CEO, BODs), farmers, promoting agencies, customers, and government officials. Later, it was administered as a semi-structured interview schedule to experts for validation and prioritization using the Garrett ranking technique. The prominent prioritized strategies were 'Capacity building of BODS to manage FPC business activities on their own', and 'Designing a well-defined business plan for the FPC' for the stakeholder category Promoting agencies/ CBBOs, 'FPCs need to strive to build trust among the member farmers','Increasing the active membership strength' were prioritized under the FPC category. Subsequently, 'Building adequate knowledge on advantages of business association with FPC', and 'Motivating members of an FPC to build their own capacities such as financial literacy' were ranked first for the farmers category. Under the category of customers, 'Showing readiness to participate in customer satisfaction surveys,' and 'Updating knowledge on FPC products by discussions with friends and family' were ranked first. 'Reorienting the policy focus from mere formation to sustained incubation of FPCs' and 'Establishing platforms for FPCs to engage in policy advocacy and representation at various levels' could ensure the sustainability of FPCs in India.

TI  - The effects of ethnicity, gender and parental financial socialisation on financial knowledge among Gen Z: the case of Sarawak, Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial socialisation experiences, socio-economic factors, demographic characteristics and the financial knowledge of first year undergraduate students. Design/methodology/approach Using a questionnaire, data were collected from a sample of 450 first year university students from both private and public universities. A multivariate regression method was adopted to examine the influence of financial socialisation among respondents of different ethnic groups and their social backgrounds on the individual's financial knowledge. Findings The findings indicate that: firstly, financial knowledge is low among first-year university students in Sarawak. Secondly, male respondents outperform female counterparts in terms of financial knowledge. Thirdly, parental financial socialisation remains the main source of financial knowledge among the students. Fourthly, there are significant differences in financial knowledge across ethnic groups. Research limitations/implications It is paramount to implement financial education programmes to elevate the financial literacy for both youth and parents since parents remain the primary source of financial socialisation for young adults. Practical implications The study suggests that financial knowledge varies according to gender and ethnicity. Hence, financial education programmes should be designed to accommodate the differences between groups based on ethnicity and gender to achieve the best outcome. Originality/value This is the first study that draws a representative sample of university students in Sarawak that examines the effects of ethnicity, gender and parental financial socialisation on financial knowledge among first year university students.

TI  - Implications of Shariah Financial Technology in Increasing Financial Inclusion to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises
T2  - ISLAMIYYAT-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC STUDIES
AB  - Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSAEs) have long been understood as playing a significant role in the economic development of a country. However MSMEs have not been able to make a significant contribution to the economy due to constraints of capital problems and limitations in meeting the requirements of bureaucracy and banking administration when applying for loan funds from banks. Due to the limited services provided by banks, the emergence of financial technology (fintech) innovation is an opportunity for MSAE's to overcome their capital problems. However, the use of fintech triggers risks borne by users or consumers such as cyber risks related to data security, data ownership, privacy, and data governance. Shariah-based fintech is one solution to extend financial inclusion to MSMEs to overcome their capital problems. The purpose of this research is to analyze the development and the contribution of Shariah fintech in strengthening the financial inclusion of MSMEs. The method used in this qualitative descriptive research is by describing and interpreting the observations and findings of 5 Shariah fintech platforms that focus on MSMEs' funding as the research sample. The result shows that the market share of Shariah fintech is 2.01% of the total fintech platform and it is caused by the lack of Shariah financial literacy. In terms of risk, even though the financing risk is relatively lower than Bank's Non-Performing Loan, other risks may arise, such as cyber risk and Shariah compliance risk. In order to mitigate the risks, the authority needs regulations for cyber security for consumer protection and supervision of Shariah compliance by the National Shariah Council of the Indonesian Ulama Council.

TI  - "One size doesn't fit all". Bank switching decisions and customer vulnerability in Europe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThis paper examines the relationships between bank switching and both customer vulnerability and consumer-oriented policies (financial education and disclosure practices).Design/methodology/approachThe analysis employs microdata from the Special Eurobarometer on Financial Products and Services, for 24 European nations. It carries out a probit estimation on the factors explaining propensity of bank switching, focusing on three characteristics associated with customer vulnerability: an advanced age, low educational attainment and residence in a rural or a relatively poor region.FindingsThe authors report that the probability of bank switching is significantly lower for three groups of vulnerable customers: the elderly, the less educated and those living in deprived regions. Further the authors identify that national financial education policies and disclosure practices have no significant effects on bank switching.Research limitations/implicationsBased on these results, the authors propose more targeted policies recognising customers' heterogeneity are required to increase bank switching behaviour.Originality/valueThis paper exploits a unique source of information on bank switching behaviour and customer characteristics across European nations. These data are complemented with information about consumer financial education policies and disclosure practices from the World Bank and geographical, market and regulatory factors at the regional and national levels. The paper contributes to two academic areas. First, it presents further evidence on heterogeneity of bank customer switching behaviour, addressed at improving the understanding of customer vulnerability in banking services. Second, it examines the efficacy of consumer-oriented policies (financial literacy and disclosure practices) in encouraging bank switching.

TI  - A Crime by Any Other Name: Gender Differences in Moral Reasoning When Judging the Tax Evasion of Cryptocurrency Traders
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
AB  - Tax evasion is a major issue for authorities worldwide. Understanding the factors that influence individuals' intrinsic motivation to pay taxes, known as their tax morale, is important for improving tax compliance. This study investigated gender differences in judging tax evasion in the context of cryptocurrency trading. Specifically, a survey study explored whether different moral foundations, financial literacies, and political orientations among females vs. males might explain potential gender differences in judging tax evasion. In an online survey, 243 U.S. adults read a vignette about a friend evading taxes in a cryptocurrency trading context. In a correlational analysis, we found that females judged tax evasion harsher, as being more morally wrong than males. Of the psychographic factors, only individualizing moral foundation values (i.e., fairness and harm avoidance) explained the harsher moral judgment by females. That is, individualizing moral foundation values were at a higher level among females, which further predicted females' harsher judgment of tax evasion. While females also had, on average, lower financial literacy and knowledge of cryptocurrencies than males, these did not predict their harsher judgment of tax evasion. The findings contribute to research on gender differences in moral judgments and highlight that a given transgression, or a specific crime, may violate different moral values in men and women. The results demonstrate to policy makers that it is important to take into account gender differences, in campaigns promoting tax morale and compliance.

TI  - The Household Multidimensional Poverty Reduction Effects of Digital Financial Inclusion: A Financial Environment Perspective
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - The poverty alleviation effects of digital financial inclusion are widely recognized, while these effects are dependent on the financial environment. However, little is known about how the financial environment influences digital financial inclusion, which leads to a reduction in household multidimensional poverty. Using matching data from Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China and Chinese Family Panel Studies for 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018, this paper estimates the impact of digital financial inclusion on household multidimensional poverty, considering the financial environment. The results show that: (1) Digital financial inclusion alleviates household multidimensional poverty and has significant alleviation effects on different dimensions of poverty. (2) Digital financial inclusion plays a particularly significant role in reducing household multidimensional poverty in China's rural areas and central-western regions. (3) Credit availability, social capital, and non-agricultural employment are important channels through which digital financial inclusion reduces household multidimensional poverty. (4) A single threshold effect governs the influence of the financial environment on the impact of digital financial inclusion on household multidimensional poverty. When the financial environment crosses the threshold value, the poverty reduction effect of digital financial inclusion is enhanced. For the components of the financial environment, a single threshold effect governs the influence of both traditional financial foundations and household financial literacy on the impact of digital financial inclusion on multidimensional poverty, whereas government financial supervision does so via a double threshold effect.

TI  - Financial access and the finance-growth nexus: evidence from developing economies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose This study examines the impact of financial institutions access and financial institutions depth on economic growth in 51 low- and lower-middle-income countries from 1996 to 2017. Design/methodology/approach The study employs an index of financial institutions depth and financial institutions access that considers the multidimensional nature of finance. The study employs a generalised least squares model as the baseline fixed effects model suffers from serial correlation. In addition, the study examines the marginal impact of financial development on growth at varying levels of financial access. Findings The results show that both financial access and financial depth are positive to growth. However, the marginal impact of financial depth is negative at low levels of financial access, while the finance-growth relationship becomes positive at higher levels of financial access. Results suggest the importance of developing inclusive financial systems that emphasise quality rather than quantity to promote economic growth. Research limitations/implications The major limitation lies in the measurement of financial access as it focusses more on financial system penetration and overlooks the other aspects of financial inclusion such as financial literacy and cultural differences. Practical implications Developing countries should continue to develop an inclusive financial system that supports the Universal Financial Access 2020 initiative. Originality/value This study provides further empirical evidence on the finance-growth literature focussing on the impact of financial inclusion which is scarce. Furthermore, the study employs an index of finance that captures the multidimensional nature of finance.

TI  - Determinants of financial inclusion in Afar Region: Evidence from selected woredas
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This paper examined the determinants of financial inclusion in Afar Region. To address the objectives of the study, two purposively selected woredas (Awash and Asaita) and one city administration (Samara-logia) were used. Three hundred and eighty-four sample households were selected for this study. Data collected from administered structured questionnaires were analyzed using the binary logistic regression model. The results show that age, use, financial literacy, and mobile banking are positively and significantly related to financial inclusion. On the other hand, barrier and income negatively and significantly affect financial inclusion. The study results reveal that 31.25% of households were included and 68.75% of households are excluded from formal financial services. Further results show that barriers to financial inclusion such as problem of access to credit, absence of collateral, interest rate, lack of literacy, lack of internet access, lack of trust for financial institutions, lack of money, problem of access to bank branches and ATMs are main obstacles of financial inclusion in Afar region. This study recommends that government and financial institutions should encourage financial service providers, offer fiscal incentives or request financial institutions and serve poor or low-income people. Financial institutions should adopt technologies that ensure financial services are more accessible such as mobile banking. Moreover, households should enhance the saving habits that are helpful to increase amount of income and the literacy level of their children for the best use of financial services.

TI  - Entrepreneurial growth intention and capability approach in agriculture: lesson from Sri Lanka
T2  - SOUTH ASIAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS STUDIES
AB  - Purpose It is imperative to offer a new perspective of Entrepreneurial Growth Intention (EGI) that draws directly upon the capability approach. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of capabilities in the context of EGI in the floriculture industry in Sri Lanka. Design/methodology/approach The study was exploratory and is mainly qualitative in nature. In-depth interviews were carried out with the owners of farms who possess experience in floriculture commercial cultivation in Sri Lanka. Findings The results emerged that there are different perspectives among farm owners regarding EGI. Drawing attention on the stories of our participants and making a three-phase analysis, we identified 31 key actions denoted by the farm owners. This work then suggests that the seven capabilities might be fruitfully framed around EGI. Research limitations/implications As the results stress the role of capabilities in the formation of an entrepreneur's growth intention is vital. Therefore, more targeted measures should be drawn to build fair and supportive facilities to obtain advanced knowledge, to familiarise with the emergence of technology and to attain professional services specifically in financial literacy. Originality/value The question of what factors influence EGI at the farm level is still largely unexplored as less is known about the effect of capabilities on EGI. The study expands the current debates on EGI and institutional environment, which allows the mapping out of capability development.

TI  - Business acumen for nursing leaders: An exploratory qualitative study
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT
AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to explore the status of and need for business acumen of nurse leaders. Background Health systems globally continue to reform to deliver better care while working within sustainable budgets. However, beyond leadership and management expertise, nurse leaders need strong business acumen to appreciate the complexity of the system. Method Two groups, emerging nurse leaders and established health system leaders, were interviewed for their perspective on four elements related to business acumen. Results Business in healthcare was defined and therefore valued with variation across both groups. Adequate business education for nurse leaders was considered lacking by both groups. Inconsistent business acumen was seen as a barrier for nursing inclusion at the system level. Conclusions Business acumen is a skillset more valuable for the nursing profession than the current educational preparation allows, creating a reputational barrier for nursing's full participation in health system-level leadership, but is considered an opportunity for the future. Implications for Nursing Management Improving the foundation business acumen across the nursing profession will not only raise the profile of nurse leader capability to input and influence across the health system but also improve the wider nursing team's understanding around nurse leader advocacy and decision making.

TI  - TRENDS IN FINANCIAL SECURITY RESEARCH: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - Achieving financial security becomes one of the main tasks of the government, business management, investors and citizens. However, at the same time, the very comprehen-sion of the essence of such security is ambiguous, as well as the mechanism for achiev-ing it. The purpose of the article is to identify the trends and key areas of financial security research by conducting a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications that are indexed in the Scopus database. A thorough review of the evolution of financial security research was conducted from 1951 to March 2023. 2,515 publications indexed in the Scopus that contain the term "financial security" in their titles, abstracts and keywords were analyzed. The VOSviewer software was used to build network maps of the rela-tionship between keywords, visualize the relationships between scholars from different countries, and build a network map of the relationship between keywords in chronolog-ical order. The results showed that since the beginning of the 90s of the 20th century, the number of publications on financial security has been increasing annually; the term "financial security" is used in the research of various fields of science; the majority of publications on financial security appeared between 2014 and 2020. The leadership of such research belongs to the USA, the United Kingdom and China. Visualization of the network map of common words based on bibliographic data allowed us to single out 11 clusters that characterize the key areas of financial security research. The following keywords were identified in each cluster: employment security, financial efficiency and stability, life safety, financial risks, social security, financial technologies, psychological state, economic security, family and personal security, financial literacy, and the covid-19 pandemic. The obtained results will contribute to a better understanding of global trends by researchers as well as promote future research in the field of financial security.

TI  - Acceptability of residential licences as quasi-land ownership documents: Evidence from Tanzania
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Most of the property owners in developing countries particularly those residing in informal settlements do not have formal land ownership documents, which weakens security of tenure and denies them access to credit. In addressing the problem, various initiatives have been taken but some of them have not been very effective. This paper uses a case example of an upgraded informal settlement in Tanzania to assess acceptability of residential licences as quasi-land ownership documents among property owners and lending institutions. Findings show that security of tenure, access to credit, property value enhancement, land conflict resolution and guarantee for compensation are the main factors that attract property owners to apply for residential licences. On the other hand, short life span of residential licences, exposure to multiple taxation and land rent, complex application procedure and lack of knowledge on residential licence uses are the main factors accounting for low residential licence application. Findings also show that some property owners do not use residential licences as collateral due to low financial literacy and fear of losing property in case of loan default. Although findings also show that many banks accept residential licences as collateral, it is also clear that having a residential licence without owning a business or having a regular income stream is not enough for a property owner to qualify for a loan because lenders are more interested in borrowers' ability to service the loan rather than mere possession of a land title or its equivalent. Knowledge of these factors is important in devising appropriate interventions that, apart from placing much emphasis on formal land ownership documents, take on board all key factors that hinder land owners from effectively utilising their land for capital and income generation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - PurposeThe prevalence of high levels of vulnerable employment in developing countries poses a formidable obstacle to their progress towards achieving SDG 8. While worker remittances (remittances) are widely recognised as a potential source of improving the welfare of people experiencing poverty, their effectiveness in alleviating vulnerable employment from a macro perspective remains unclear. Consequently, the study examines the impact of remittances on reducing vulnerable employment.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses macro-level data from 73 developing countries covering 1990-2021. Vulnerable employment is measured in three forms: total, male, and female. Remittances are measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product. The findings are empirically analysed using dynamic panel data estimation techniques. A two-stage least squares (IV 2SLS) approach addresses remittance endogeneity.FindingsTwo key findings emerge from the study. First, increased remittances are associated with a decline in the total share of workers resorting to vulnerable employment, albeit a modest decline. Second, the remittance surge is associated with more males than females leaving vulnerable employment, indicating its gender-specific effects. These findings remain robust to several checks.Practical implicationsThe study's findings underscore the potential of leveraging remittances to reduce vulnerable employment. To this end, selective and targeted policy interventions that promote financial literacy and inclusion, which serve as the cornerstones for effectively utilising remittances, are advised.Originality/valueTo the best of my knowledge, this study is the first to examine the impact of remittances on vulnerable employment on a macro scale. As such, the study makes a novel contribution to understanding how remittances serve as an enabler for SDG 8.

TI  - SMARTPHONE ACTIVITIES IN PREDICTING TENDENCY TOWARDS ONLINE FINANCIAL SERVICES
T2  - EKONOMSKI VJESNIK
AB  - Purpose: Considering the rapid progress of information and communication technology (ICT) and its influence on daily life, it is inevitable that its impact will also be visible in the financial sector, especially through efforts to present digital financial services as widely as possible and bring them closer to potential users. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate university students' smartphone activities, their use and attitudes towards digital financial services, and to build a neural network model capable of distinguish-ing students according to their awareness of the benefits related to using online financial services.
   Methodology: An online questionnaire was applied to collect data on students' smartphone activity and their tendency to use online financial services. Depending on the variable type, the Kruskal-Wallis H test and Kendall's tau-b were used to assess the association between variables, while multilayer perceptron and radial basis function neural networks were used for the creation of the optimal model.
   Results: Participants in this study achieved an average score of 6.56 (SD = 1.27) for smartphone activity, and the results showed that the optimal neural network model obtained had an overall accuracy of 70.73%. However, smartphone activity did not have an excessive effect on the efficiency of this model.
   Conclusion: The obtained neural network model and its sensitivity analysis managed to reveal some hid-den patterns which could be beneficial to educators in terms of improvements of students' digital and financial literacy as well as to the financial sector in terms of increasing performance and interest of this population in digital financial services.

TI  - Financial distress and COVID-19: evidence from working individuals in India
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore the impact of the containment measures during COVID-19 on individuals' finances, financial resilience during such distress and identifying the most financially vulnerable among them. Tracing such impact during the pandemic has been challenging due to a lack of representative data. This paper addresses this gap in the present study. Design/methodology/approach A survey has been conducted using a structured questionnaire containing various items that portray the impact on income, spending, saving, investment, borrowing, insurance and retirement. The sample consists of 699 respondents and purposive and snowball sampling has been used for data collection. The results are presented and analyzed using infographics and frequency distributions. This study conducts an analysis of variance and Chi-square tests for significance. Findings This paper finds a fall in income and limited ability to cope with the current economic conditions. The survey highlights inadequate savings and insurance, weak retirement planning, outstanding loans and under-diversified investments inhibiting financial resilience even among the higher-income group. Particularly, lower-income strata, women and not much educated are most financially vulnerable. Further, no substantial financial benefits have been received from the government and people rely on their usual income sources. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that measures the pandemic's impact on personal finances, especially in connection with a developing economy like India. Policy interventions are critical to the millions for whom financial literacy is required now more than ever.

TI  - An assessment of mortgage loan default propensity in Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Purpose Credit market development requires appropriate credit assessment and default policies. This paper aims to examine the impact of household characteristics on mortgage default, using survey data collected from Ghanaian financial institutions. Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered using semi-structured questionnaires from customers of five universal banks in Ghana. A logistic regression was used to model the determinants of credit default propensity. Findings Contrary to established knowledge, the study shows that females are more likely to default on credit than their male counterparts. This is even more likely if the female is older, unmarried, divorced and financially illiterate and has lower educational attainments. These factors are associated with lower earning capacity, which increases default tendencies. The findings confirm that price instability (typified by excessive movements in inflation and exchange rates in addition to low national savings rate) are adversely linked to credit defaults. Borrower's perception of constraints to credit access (such as collateral requirements, interest rate and loan size) influence credit default. Banks should be encouraged to invest in the financial literacy skills development of their customers to mitigate credit default tendencies. Social implications - The study is of practical value to credit officers and the development of the credit market in Ghana. Anovel model is presented for assessing credit applications and developing credit default policies. Originality/value The research findings have not only expanded the frontiers of literature but also empirically examined the determinants of credit default propensity, which provides a basis for developing and improving credit default policy in the credit market.
