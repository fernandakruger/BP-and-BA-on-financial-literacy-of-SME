TI  - Self-esteem, financial knowledge and financial behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Financial knowledge is an important but insufficient driver of responsible financial behavior. Having a positive evaluation of oneself may also be essential for individuals to initiate and persist with the daunting process of financial management. In this study, we distinguish subjective financial knowledge from objective financial knowledge, and we propose that self-esteem relates to financial behavior both directly as well as indirectly through subjective financial knowledge. Results based on a nationally representative dataset of U.S. adults suggest that self-esteem significantly relates to individual financial behavior after controlling for financial knowledge and other socioeconomic factors. The association between self-esteem and financial behavior could be both direct and indirect through subjective financial knowledge. These findings highlight the importance of psychological traits such as self-esteem in explaining financial behavior difference. Its implications are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - FEATURES OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE REGIONAL MODELS OF THE HOUSEHOLDS' FINANCIAL BEHAVIOR
T2  - MANAGEMENT THEORY AND STUDIES FOR RURAL BUSINESS AND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The article is devoted to identifying the features of the transformation of the regional models of the households' financial behavior. An algorithm and a method for determining the level of the households' financial behavior transformation are proposed. Based on this methodology, the authors made calculations that allowed to group the regions according to the level of the households' financial behavior transformation. As a result, four groups of regions have been identified: with a high level of the households' financial behavior transformation, with a level above average, with a medium and low level of the households' financial behavior transformation. Features of each group of regions are described. The increase in the impact of digitalization on the financial behavior of households as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has been demonstrated.

TI  - Does Financial Behavior Influence Financial Well-being?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - Financial behavior and financial well-being are two closely related aspects of an individual's financial decision making. This study attempts to investigate the extent to which financial behavior influences financial well-being in the Indian scenario. The data is collected using a structured questionnaire from a sample of 150 respondents. The study employs Financial Management Behaviour Scale (FMBS) (Dew & Xiao, 2012) to measure financial behavior. Factor analysis and multiple regression are performed to find the influence of financial behavior on financial well-being. The findings of the study suggest that except for credit commitment all the other behavioral factors like future security, savings and investments, credit indiscipline, and financial consciousness have a significant impact on the financial well-being of an individual in the Indian scenario. The regression coefficients of financial well-being are strongly determined by financial consciousness. The study is a contribution to the existing behavioral studies literature and the model used identifies the factors that influence the financial well-being in the Indian scenario. The study is conducted during the year 2020, so the results could have been influenced by the economic scenario of the period. The results of the study can be used by financial advisors to understand the financial well-being in the Indian scenario.

TI  - Predicting the Financial Behavior of the Religious Organization Board in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The religious organization members have a unique take on the spiritual factors related to their daily life. The present study contributed to the lack of discussion investigating this particular pool of data's financial behavior. This article regressed several predictors of economic behavior, i.e., the locus of control, financial attitude, income, and religiosity, with 460 respondents. The results of the research are as follows: Financial attitude partially influences the financial behavior of Muhammadiyah committee members. Income partially influences the financial behavior of Muhammadiyah committee members. This research indicates that income is one of the factors that plays an essential role in determining the merits of improvement of the financial behavior of Muhammadiyah committee members. The higher the level of income received by Muhammadiyah members, the higher the desire to spend the money. Religiosity partially influences the financial behavior of the religious board of Muhammadiyah members in Indonesia. The higher the religiosity of Muhammadiyah committee members will encourage better financial management. Religiosity indicates how often individuals or Muhammadiyah members practice the religious sharia that they embrace. The findings of this study reveal that locus of control, financial attitude, income, and religiosity are the strong predictors of the board of the religious organization's financial behavior in Indonesia.

TI  - Does financial behavior mediate the relationship between self-control and financial security?
T2  - CROATIAN OPERATIONAL RESEARCH REVIEW
AB  - People have different financial behavior depending on their psychological characteristics, which can reflect their financial security. Self-control is also an important predictor of financial security. People with greater self-control are more likely to save money and less likely to get into debt. Therefore, they are more secure and satisfied with their financial situation. This paper explores whether good self-control directly affects financial security or if its impact comes indirectly through good financial behavior. For the purposes of the research, a survey analysis was designed and applied to a sample of 494 respondents. Structural equation modeling was used for testing the research hypothesis. The results confirmed that there is a significant mediating effect of financial behavior on the relationship between self-control and financial security. The research contributes to a better understanding of financial behavior predictors among individuals with different psychological characteristics. Future research should also include testing for differences between various demographic groups of people in the impact of self-control on financial behavior and security.

TI  - Does Financial Literacy Affect Household Financial Behavior? The Role of Limited Attention
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Financial literacy is essential for every individual concerned with public welfare and household portfolio choices. In this study, we investigate the impact of household financial literacy on individuals' financial behavior using the China Household Financial Survey Data (CHFS) of 2015 and 2017. The results show that financial knowledge has significant current, long-term, and dynamic effects on financial behavior. This finding suggests that financial literacy is an important factor in shaping and improving financial behavior. Second, financial literacy can improve residents' limited attention, and residents with high attention tend to have formal bank accounts, participate in the stock market, and engage in financial behaviors in situations such as risky financial markets. High attention also helps to improve residents' financial behavior. This relationship suggests that financial literacy positively impacts formal bank account holding, participation in financial markets, participation in commercial insurance, participation in pension plans, and credit card holdings through limited attention channels that facilitate access to specific financial information. In addition, heterogeneity analysis showed that the impact of financial literacy on financial behavior differs significantly between urban and rural households, between men and women, and between high and low education levels. The study provides valuable insights for policy implications to enhance financial literacy, such as carrying out financial training to improve residents' knowledge about financial aspects, which further helps to optimize household financial decision-making.

TI  - The Moderation Role of Religiosity on the Relationship Between Risk Tolerance and Financial Behavior of Small Businesses' Owners
T2  - QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB  - From the psychology and religious perspective, there is a growing faith that religiosity influences financial behavior. Most available literature has only discussed religiosity as the antecedents of investment behavior in various contexts. There are no yet inquiries in financial behavior that examine the role of religiosity as a moderating variable. Hence, this study has provided novelty by testing the role of religiosity as a moderating variable in the relationship between risk tolerance and financial behavior. The population of this study was Muslim SMEs owners in Banyumas Regency, Indonesia. Ninety-one respondents were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. This study found that risk tolerance and religiosity variables had a positive and significant effect on financial behavior. The interaction effect of the religiosity variable would weaken risk tolerance on financial behavior. This research had significant implications for the development of financial behavior theory in SMEs and developing SMEs.

TI  - The Effects of Financial Literacy, Self-Efficacy and Self-Coping on Financial Behavior of Emerging Adults
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This study examines the relationship between financial behavior, financial literacy, self-efficacy, and self-coping among emerging adults. The study population is 790 respondents from 11 Credit Counselling and Debt Management (CCDM). Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) was used to analyze Pearson Correlation and Multiple regression. It was used to determine the relationships and recognize determinants of emerging adults' financial behavior respectively. In this study, financial literacy, self-efficacy, self-coping, and financial behavior variables were entered into the regression. A total of 790 respondents aged 40 and below were selected. An independent sample t-test was administered to compare the financial behavior scores for females and males. The results reveal that there was significant difference in the mean of financial behavior scores for females (M = 87.20, SD = 18.00) and males (M = 89.70, SD = 16.80; t (765) = 2.010, p = 0.045, two-tailed). The multiple regression results indicate that the model explained 13.4% of the variance in financial behavior, which is predicted significantly by the model (F = 38.361, p = 0.000). This study will be beneficial to policymakers to improve living conditions and to promote good financial behavior, financial literacy, self-efficacy as well as self-coping especially for emerging adults in Malaysia.

TI  - Sharia Financial Knowledge And Financial Behavior As A Basis For Measuring Financial Literacy
T2  - QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB  - Our daily life is inseparable from financial problems. Problems in finances are more often caused by errors in management, as well as errors in distinguishing between needs and wants. One of the reasons for the number of poor people in Medan City is their lack of ability to manage their finances to meet their daily needs. The level of public financial literacy will also provide benefits to the financial sector, especially those directly related to the public's contribution to the use of financial products and services. The conventional financial system approach is very different from the Islamic financial system or what is commonly referred to as Islamic finance. This study aims to analyze the level of knowledge of Islamic finance, and financial behavior, and also analyze the effect of knowledge of Islamic finance on financial behavior and the level of Islamic financial literacy of members of the Muhammadiyah organization in Medan City. This type of research is quantitative research with the method of deduction. Research is included in the type of correlational research. Data The population in this study is a large Muhammadiyah family in the city of Medan with the sampling process using the purposive sampling method. Data sourced from respondents was obtained through questionnaires. This research uses SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) analysis tool. The results showed that in general the level of Islamic financial knowledge of Muhammadiyah members was low, but financial behavior was good. The behavior and knowledge of members ' Islamic finance show a positive and significant correlation. At the literacy level, the results show that members of the Muhammadiyah organization are generally classified as less literate.

TI  - The moderator effect of financial literacy on the relationship between locus of control and financial behavior
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose This study examines the effects of variables such as financial literacy and locus of control on the financial behavior of individual investors. Additionally, this article aims to reveal the moderator effect of financial literacy on locus of control and financial behavior. Design/methodology/approach Responses were collected from a questionnaire given to a convenience sample of 1,347 individual investors. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), which reveals the factor structure of the scale, was used at the beginning of the study, and then confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to confirm this new factor structure. Hypothetical relationships were examined using structural equation modeling. Findings The study provides statistical support for the validity and reliability of the scales. The statistical results of the analysis reveal that financial literacy and locus of control have a positive effect on financial behavior. Moreover, the authors prove that financial literacy changes the relationship between internal locus of control and financial behavior. In conclusion, financial literacy plays a significant role as a moderator variable that interacts with locus of control. Originality/value The findings of the research are important in demonstrating empirical evidence for the theoretical correlations. In support of the current literature, this study has confirmed the positive effects of internal locus of control and financial literacy on the financial behavior of individual investors. In addition, it has been determined that the relationship between an individual's financial behavior and internal locus of control varies according to their level of financial literacy.

TI  - Attitudes Toward Money and Control Strategies of Financial Behavior: A Comparison Between Overindebted and Non-overindebted Consumers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This paper addresses whether overindebted and non-overindebted consumers differ in their attitude toward money (specifically, the degree to which consumers care about money and feel difficulties keeping track of their money) and how this attitude impacts three different financial behavior categories: record keeping (e.g., recording spending in writing), adjusting balance (e.g., trying to find ways to decrease one's expenses to match income), and monitoring balance (e.g., monitoring one's spending to see if it is in line with what is expected). Overindebted consumers were recruited via an NGO for consumer defense and were categorized (whenever possible) into two subgroups: consumers who became overindebted due to internal causes (e.g., bad financial management) and consumers who became overindebted due to external causes (e.g., unemployment). Non-overindebted consumers were a convenience sample. Non-overindebted consumers showed more positive attitudes toward money than both groups of overindebted consumers and overindebted due to external causes showed more positive attitudes than overindebted consumers due to internal causes. All groups share similar financial management behaviors except for monitoring balance, which was more frequent among non-overindebted consumers. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicates that money attitudes helped explain financial behavior differences between consumers above and beyond their indebtedness status. Consumers' attitude predicted financial behaviors, even when controlling for relevant socioeconomic variables (education, income, age, and gender). Further analyses comparing money attitudes and financial behavior for the three subgroups (non-overindebted, overindebted due to internal causes, and overindebted due to external causes) showed no differences.

TI  - Like Father Like Son: How Does Parents' Financial Behavior Affect Their Children's Financial Behavior?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - This paper investigates the intergenerational influence on financial behavior. Using two national longitudinal studies: the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey Children and Young Adults (NLSCYA) and the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey (NLSY79), we link the financial behavior of 2,520 young adults back to their general self-control skill and their parents' financial behavior conducted during children's adolescence. We find evidence of intergenerational consistency in financial behavior between parents and their children. Results from the generalized structural equation model indicate that parents' financial behavior affects that of their children both directly and indirectly through general self-control skill development. Furthermore, the influence of parents is moderated by parent-child relationship. These findings highlight the importance of parental financial socialization. Its implications are discussed.

AB  - This research examines the impact of an external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, an internal locus of control, and social media on financial well-being, focusing on the mediating role of financial behavior. Financial wellbeing can be improved by reducing the external locus of control, increasing individual financial self-efficacy and financial literacy, and using social media appropriately. Furthermore, the importance of financial behavior is emphasized by the indirect effects of external locus of control, financial literacy, financial self-efficacy, and social media on financial wellbeing. The study features an online survey questionnaire with 438 respondents. The relationships were investigated using PLS-SEM. According to the study's findings, financial influencers are social media data variables that significantly affect financial behavior. These findings can assist policymakers, and business leaders in understanding the most influential factors affecting Indonesia's financial wellbeing. Furthermore, the Indonesian government encourages the younger generation to improve its literacy index through public financial education. Research into financial wellbeing is critical because it aligns with the government's goal of improving the stability and health of the population's finances. Individuals can maintain financial control, allowing them to meet financial goals, manage unexpected expenses during emergencies, deal with financial problems, and enjoy life.

TI  - IMMIGRANT INVESTORS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS: MODES OF FINANCIAL BEHAVIOR
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study investigates the modes of financial behavior of immigrants, comparing them with native-born investors. The study developed a theoretical framework for investigating the determinants of financial behavior, combining Bourdieu's concept of economic habitus with the theories explaining behavior of investors in financial markets. Methods of clustering analysis and multinomial logit regression model were used. The study found that an investor's behavior mode is strongly predicted by determinants derived from cultural, economic and social capital. For low-income persons, the culture of origin shapes their financial behavior, and for high-income persons, their economic capital and affiliation to social class are more important. Over time, immigrants assimilate in their financial choices. This study contributes to research of financial behavior as well as migration research by explaining the factors that affect preferences for financial assets allocation among immigrants. Understanding migrants' modes of financial behavior will help policymakers to facilitate accumulation of wealth by immigrants, and in this way contribute to the process of their integration.

TI  - Cognitive abilities, self-efficacy, and financial behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This paper investigates the effect of cognitive abilities on financial behavior among older adults. Using the U.S. Health and Retirement Study, I find that cognitive abilities significantly affect financial behavior through two channels: ability and self-efficacy. People with higher cognition scores achieve better financial outcomes. This positive association is especially strong in tasks having high demand of cognitive abilities, which confirms the ability channel of the cognitive ability effect. In addition, there is evidence for the self-efficacy channel as a secondary source of cognitive influence. Lower cognitive abilities decrease people's sense of self-efficacy, which, in turn, significantly decreases financial management efficiency. The findings have important policy implications, specifically that more effort is needed to assist the growing older population through the cognitive aging process and that noncognitive skills, as a secondary source of influence, also warrant attention.

TI  - Navigating the digital financial landscape: unraveling the impact of financial behavior traits on women-owned enterprises in the new normal perspective
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Exploring the financial behavior traits amidst the unexpected financial challenges and the unparalleled rise in fintech, this study provides insight into the interplay of entrepreneur digital financial literacy (EDFL), entrepreneur financial competency (EFC), and entrepreneur financial skill (EFS) impacting entrepreneur financial decision-making (EFDM). Toward this goal, data were gathered from 223 active women entrepreneurs from India who have accounts in the social media platform. The three-step hierarchical regression analysis disclosed that an entrepreneur with sound EDFL, EFS, and EFC can significantly enhance strategic decision-making (EFDM). The research outcome reveals that EFDM is a consistent predictor of the financial performance of women-owned enterprises. In addition, the entrepreneur's financial decision-making does not mediate the relationship between financial experience, financial competency, financial skill budgeting, and financial skill_acumen with financial performance. In contrast, partial mediation is observed between digital financial awareness, digital financial knowledge, and financial skill_analytics. The novel insight accounted for a significantly low level of experience in entrepreneurs' utilization of digital platforms for payment, financing loans, and asset management. The outcome carries academic, regulatory, and managerial significance, recognizing the unique interaction; the cumulative efforts strengthen the capacity to address socio-economic challenges and translate them into gender-specific policy interventions and practices.

TI  - Financial Behavior Change and Progress Toward Self-Sufficiency: A Goal-Framing Theory Application
T2  - EMERGING ADULTHOOD
AB  - We applied goal-framing theory to determine whether there were discernible patterns in emerging adults' financial behavior from college to career and whether those patterns were associated with progress toward self-sufficiency. Using longitudinal data collected over 5 years from a college cohort of emerging adults (N = 968) in the United States, we estimated latent growth curve models and identified three financial-behavior patterns suggestive of the overarching motivations in the theory: planful (gain), present focused (hedonic), and socially compliant (normative). Using multinomial logistic regression analysis, we found that higher perceived financial control, more positive financial attitudes, higher perceived parental expectations, and more exposure to financial education were predictive of a gain pattern. Analyses of variance showed that the gain financial-behavior pattern was associated with the most progress toward self-sufficiency (adult stability, career status, and well-being). We discuss the findings as they pertain to the connection between emerging adults' financial behavior and progress toward self-sufficiency.

T2  - MARKETING LETTERS
AB  - Debt has reached staggering levels among North Americans. Unfortunately, there is deficiency of research that investigates effective means of helping consumers control their debt. We examine how control priming changes consumers' irresponsible financial behavior. We show that control priming reduces credit card spending and intentions to take credit card risk. We also demonstrate that consumers who score high on self-esteem are more likely to benefit from control priming while those who score low on self-esteem show a backlash effect.

TI  - Financial Literacy of High School Graduates: Long- and Short-Term Financial Behavior by Age Group
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between financial literacy and long- and short-term financial behaviors by age group for those without a college degree. Financial literacy was measured and discussed in the context of three components: objective financial knowledge, confidence in financial knowledge, and financial ability. Financial ability was significant in each age group and had the highest odds ratios of the three components of the financial literacy construct for the short-term index. Both confidence in financial knowledge and financial ability were significant in each age group for budgeting while objective financial knowledge was not. The results suggest that confidence in both knowledge and ability are important influences on positive financial behaviors for those without a college degree.

T2  - SERVICE BUSINESS
AB  - As consumer requirements for financial services permeate society, they link various financial institutions more closely together, developing divergent financial products. This research develops a conceptual framework for discussing consumer money attitudes, financial literacy regarding financial decisions, and financial behavior. Study findings suggest that consumers who have retention-planning and achievement-esteem attitudes toward money make high-risk financial decisions; anxiety toward money tends to exist mainly in low-risk investors. Financial literacy affects consumer financial behaviors, and demographic variables play segmentation roles. Theoretical contributions and management implications are provided in the study for related research, education departments and financial firms.

TI  - The role of financial behavior in mediating the influence of socioeconomic characteristics and neurotic personality traits on financial satisfaction
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Inherent socioeconomic characteristics and personality traits can directly affect an individual's financial satisfaction. There is limited research on the role of financial behavior as a mediating variable for the influence of these two factors on financial satisfaction. It is important to know whether individuals with certain characteristics and personality traits can increase their financial satisfaction by improving their financial behavior. This study included 600 Indonesian participants, with primary data obtained through a structured questionnaire. Data analyses were performed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results indicate that at 5% of alpha, financial behavior consisting of investment, debt, and spending behavior can mediate the effects of gender, age, education, income, and traits of neuroticism on financial satisfaction. Furthermore, the higher individual scores on neuroticism, the worse their investment, debt, and behaviors are, while their herding behavior and financial dissatisfaction increase. Moreover, these people are often financially impecunious. Financial behavior plays a mediating role in the influence of socioeconomic characteristics and neurotic personality traits on financial satisfaction. If individuals with high neuroticism scores can effectively manage their financial behavior, financial dissatisfaction will decrease. They often require assistance when making decisions.

TI  - Financial literacy, confidence and well-being: The mediating role of financial behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - This study aims to investigate the impact of financial literacy and confidence on the financial well-being of US households and to explore the mediating role of financial behaviors in this relationship. To do this, we analyzed a large dataset from the two most recent waves of the state-by-state National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), covering a representative sample of US adults (n = 43,104). Results from multiple regression and mediation analyses, adjusted for relevant controls, show that financial literacy influences financial well-being directly and indirectly (mediated) through financial behaviors. Our analyses further indicate that financial confidence has a positive impact, directly and indirectly through financial behaviors, on financial well-being. Overall, our results suggest that higher levels of financial literacy and confidence lead to more responsible financial behavior, which, in turn, influences financial well-being. The findings of this study provide a valuable addition to the literature and directions for future research.

TI  - The role of self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking and self-control in shaping the financial behavior and financial well-being of young adults
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The sustainable financial behavior and financial well-being have been a key concern among the developing societies; thereby encompassing the various psychological factors which play a role in influencing individual's positive financial behavior and financial well-being, this study is conducted. Research focusing on the psychological aspect of human financial behavior and well-being is scarce, focusing more on the cognitive side such as financial literacy and numeracy. The aim of this research study is to find the role played by the non-cognitive factors such as self-esteem, self-control, optimism and deliberative thinking, in forming the financial behavior and financial well-being of the young adults. A sample of 429 university students from public and private sector was collected via an online and field survey using purposive sampling technique. The survey contained measures for demographics, self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking, self-control, general financial behavior and financial well-being. SPSS and PLS-SEM tools were used for the exploration of the relationships among dependent and independent variables. The results of PLS path analysis demonstrate that among the non-cognitive factors, self-control and deliberative thinking show a significant association with both financial behavior, and financial security. Self-esteem plays no significant role in forming the financial behavior of the young adults when all the variables are taken together but it exhibits a significant association with financial well-being (financial security and financial anxiety). Optimism on the other hand exhibits no significant association with both financial behavior and financial well-being (financial security and financial anxiety). The results of this study complement the previous studies and also put forth new outcomes. This research is unique as it is the first of its kind conducted in a consumption-oriented economy like Pakistan. In addition to the previous studies which have often established the link of self-esteem with general well-being, this study goes further by analyzing the association between self-esteem and financial well-being and by the identification of the role played by non-cognitive factors like self-esteem, optimism, deliberative thinking and self-control together on the financial behavior and financial well-being of the individuals using PLS-SEM approach.

TI  - The Financial Behavior of Investment Decision Making Between Real and Financial Assets Sectors
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This research was conducted to achieve several objectives and focus research was based on financial behavior theory and prospect theory as grounded theory e.g., investigate the financial decision-making behavior between financial and real assets investment, and confirm the relationship existing between herding behavior and overconfidence factors to the level of loss and regret aversion, and financial literacy into real assets investment decisions. The study used 220 real estate auction respondents as investor samples at the State Assets and Auction Service Office Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Data was collected through the use of a questionnaire consisting of 23 questions to measure the variables. Moreover, the research data passed through several feasibility tests like the inner and outer modeling by Partial Least Square - Structural equation model (PLS-SEM) while the hypotheses formulated were also tested to determine the magnitude of the variable relationship. Through the use of the direct and intervening test, loss and regret aversion variables have a positive and significant effect while financial literacy variables have no significant effect. There is a slight difference in the decision-making process for real assets and financial assets investors. Investment decision making behavior in the financial assets sector requires less complicated decisions compared to the decisions related to real assets investments.

TI  - The Impact of Financial Socialization and Financial Literacy on Financial Behaviors: An Empirical Study in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The research aims to evaluate college students' financial behavior and provide empirical insight into factors that may influence their financial behavior by investigating whether financial socialization, financial experience, and financial literacy are meaningful for students' financial behavior. The surveys data was conducted with 595 college students from all over Indonesia then analyzed using Structural Equation Model (SEM). The results demonstrate that financial socialization positively influences financial literacy and financial behavior. On the other hand, financial experience has a negative influence on financial literacy, yet a positive one on financial behavior. Furthermore, the result also shows financial socialization are the key determinant of financial literacy and financial literacy is vital and plays an essential role for financial behavior and it may derive from financial socialization and financial literacy. It indicates that the influence of social agents can benefit students in improving their financial literacy and behavior. However, experience also can influence their financial behaviors. The lack of experience of college students leads to inadequate financial knowledge and raises their risk of financial decisions. Students with sufficient financial knowledge and exhibiting good financial behavior can make wise decisions in financial planning and management, thus may prevent financial issues in the future.

TI  - Consumer Financial Capability and Financial Satisfaction
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine associations between consumer financial capability and financial satisfaction. Consumer financial capability was measured by three sets of variables, perceived financial capability, financial literacy, and financial behavior. Using data from the 2009 US State-by-State Survey of Financial Capability, the results indicated the positive association between perceived financial capability and financial satisfaction. The findings suggested that desirable financial behavior increases while risky financial behavior decreases financial satisfaction. Subjective financial literacy was also found to contribute positively to financial satisfaction. The positive association between objective financial literacy and financial satisfaction was found in bivariate analyses but not in multivariate analyses. The results imply that to enhance consumer financial well-being, consumer financial education programs should emphasize action taking and encourage consumers to avoid risky financial behavior, engage in desirable financial behavior, and improve financial self-efficacy.

AB  - This study examines the timing of financial education and its impact on short-term and long-term financial behavior. We also explore the power of financial education on financial knowledge and examine the link between financial knowledge and positive financial behavior. Exposure to financial education during multiple life stages leads to a better financial outcome. Financial education taught via multiple channels, including high school, college, the workplace, and at home, is the most optimal in the long run. For those who did not attend college, being exposed to financial education in high school is significantly associated with positive financial behavior. We cite implications for all financial education advocates. Policymakers in the financial capability arena can stay abreast of the channels of financial education that produce the most fruitful economic and societal gains.

TI  - Financial Education Effects on Financial Behavior and Well-Being: The Mediating Roles of Improved Objective and Subjective Financial Knowledge and Parallels in Physical Health
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING
AB  - How does financial education lead to improved financial behavior and higher financial well-being? An influential Consumer Financial Protection Bureau model introduced in 2015 proposes that the goal of financial education is to improve financial well-being and that financial education does so by increasing financial knowledge, which improves financial behavior, which improves financial well-being. In this study, the authors test links in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau model, examining the differential roles of objective and subjective knowledge. They also test whether an analogous model might capture effects of physical health education on physical health knowledge, behavior, and well-being. They report a quasi-experiment comparing changes in financial and physical health knowledge, behavior, and well-being at two time points in a semester for students enrolled in a personal finance class, a personal health class, or neither. This study reports the first causal estimates of flow from financial education to financial knowledge to financial behaviors to a validated measure of subjective financial well-being. Financial education caused large changes in both objective and subjective knowledge. Yet only subjective knowledge mediated the large effects of financial education on changes in downstream behaviors. The authors find weaker but similar results for physical health. The findings suggest that financial education efforts should be refocused to foster subjective knowledge and improved behavior.

TI  - Financial Literacy among the Millennial Generation: Relationships between Knowledge, Skills, Attitude, and Behavior
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - This study aims to determine the level of financial literacy among the millennial generation and to examine the correlation of their financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial skills with their financial behavior. Multiple choice questions were used to measure financial knowledge with results grouped into three categories: low, moderate, and high. Financial attitude, financial skills, and financial behavior were also grouped using the quartile method into three categories: poor, fair, and good. Chi-squared analysis was used to test the hypotheses, with correspondence analysis conducted to identify the characteristics of the millennial generation and to graphically illustrate the gap. Regarding financial attitude, financial skills, and financial behavior, the proportions of respondents in the 'fair' category, were 70.6%, 66.5%, and 72.2%, respectively. Significant relationships were found not only between financial attitude and financial management behavior, but also between financial skills and financial management behavior. However, the relationship was not significant between financial knowledge and financial behavior.

TI  - A Study of the Emotional Intelligence and Personality Traits of University Finance Students
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - Studies on financial behavior indicate that emotional intelligence (EI) and personality traits (PTs) explain much of the bias in financial activity. This study aims to identify in which dimensions of theEI and PTs of university students in finance further training is needed to avoid financial behavior bias. To this end, the EI and PT levels of a sample of university finance students and financial industry professionals were compared using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue) and Big Five Inventory questionnaire. Subsequently, the dimensions of EI and PTs in which students have a deficit compared to professionals were identified, and the impacts that this deficit causes on the financial behavior of students were determined. The results indicate that students are deficient in the EI competencies related to empathy, emotion regulation, self-motivation, stress management, optimism, and self-esteem. Furthermore, PTs are related to kindness, awareness, openness, and extraversion. This deficit makes students more likely to have financial behavior biases such as risk tolerance, endowment, optimism, self-control, and loss aversion. These findings suggest that universities should be aware of providing financial students with full training in EI and PTs to help them successfully address their professional future.

TI  - DOES TIME MATTER? IMPACT OF FINANCIAL DECISIONMAKING ABILITIES ON FINANCIAL CHOICES MEDIATED BY TIME PERSPECTIVE
T2  - SERBIAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial decision -making ability and financial choices, and also to check the mediating role of time perspective in this relationship. Financial decision -making ability is composed of two factors: financial behavior (FB) and financial literacy (FL). Whereas, three financial choices are used, which are: investment, savings, and consumption. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), the sample of 380 participants was used to analyze the results. The findings indicate that both financial literacy and financial behavior significantly increase the investment and choices of individuals, while financial behavior also increase consumption. In addition, study found that different factors of time perspective also mediate the relationship between financial decision -making ability and financial choices. The paper concludes with significant policy implications.

TI  - Financial risk tolerance and its determinants: The perspective of personnel from security services in Ghana
T2  - BORSA ISTANBUL REVIEW
AB  - The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the financial risk tolerance of personnel in the various security services in Ghana (i.e., people who serve in the various public security divisions, including the military, immigration, police, customs, firefighting, and prisons). In particular, we examine the predictors and outcomes of financial risk tolerance and further assess whether financial risk tolerance mediates the relationship between the predictor variables and financial behavior. A partial least square structural equation modeling analysis of data collected from a crosssection of security service personnel revealed that financial threat, trust, and deliberative thinking significantly influence financial risk tolerance. We also found that financial risk tolerance is a strong predictor of financial behavior. In addition, financial risk tolerance mediates the relationship between financial threat and trust and financial behavior. The findings in this study are relevant to the leaders of the security services in developing strategies to ensure the financial security of the personnel.

TI  - Financial Self-Efficacy and Women's Personal Finance Behaviour: A Case study of Public Sector Banks in Pakistan
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - In this study we examine the impact of financial self-efficacy on the financial behavior of the working women, along with the different personal attitudes including financial anxiety, self-esteem, self-control and financial stress. Impacts of the financial literacy and risk preferences on the financial behavior also examined in this study. Data has been collected from the working women in public sectors banks. For collecting the data we used the questionnaire survey method and collect responses from the 300 participants. Data has analysed through the different statistical technique including, descriptive statistics, correlation and OLS regression analysis. We find that self-esteem, self-control, risk preferences has the significant impact on the financial behavior of the women. While self-efficacy and financial literacy has ambiguous results in our study we find no relation with financial behavior. Financial stress and financial anxiety also have no significant relationship with financial behavior of the working women in public sector banks.

TI  - Can gamification improve financial behavior? The moderating role of app expertise
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore potential benefits of gamification (application of game-playing elements) for financial well-being and motivation to save.
   Design/methodology/approach - A preliminary survey of college students explored how gamification principles incorporated into money-savings/personal finance smartphone apps could improve financial well-being. The main study utilized Mechanical Turk participants, exposing them to financial game app descriptions that emphasized social features (e.g. leaderboards and ability to share achievements) or economic features (e.g. ability to earn real money or a higher interest rate). Objective and subjective financial measures including expertise with financial apps, perceived benefits of financial apps and behavioral intentions were examined.
   Findings - Financial worry, financial literacy, subjective knowledge and expertise with money-savings/financial applications predicted financial well-being. Additionally, consumers varied in their preferences for certain financial game app features based on past financial app experience. Those who already used a financial app tend to exhibit higher subjective (though not objective) knowledge, and want both "social" and "economic" features of financial applications, whereas those with no experience are more motivated by economic features.
   Practical implications - These results could be used to guide game designers regarding which features may be more attractive to consumers depending on their prior expertise with financial smartphone applications. Financial services marketing would benefit from further research into whether smartphone financial applications that emphasize social features have benefits for consumers' motivation and financial well-being.
   Originality/value - Examining college students about to enter the real world and the general population, this project contributes to research to improve understanding of financial well-being by examining how already having a financial gamification application impacts perceptions of knowledge and expertise, as well as intentions to save given a more socially focused vs economically focused savings app. Additional research needs to further explore gamification as an experimental intervention to ultimately improve both subjective financial well-being and objective financial behaviors, especially for consumers with lower expertise and high risk of financial vulnerability.

TI  - Spendthrifts and Tightwads in Childhood: Feelings about Spending Predict Children's Financial Decision Making
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION MAKING
AB  - Adults differ in the extent to which they find spending money to be distressing; tightwads find spending money painful, and spendthrifts do not find spending painful enough. This affective dimension has been reliably measured in adults and predicts a variety of important financial behaviors and outcomes (e.g., saving behavior and credit scores). Although children's financial behavior has also received attention, feelings about spending have not been studied in children, as they have in adults. We measured the spendthrift-tightwad (ST-TW) construct in children for the first time, with a sample of 5- to 10-year-old children (N=225). Children across the entire age range were able to reliably report on their affective responses to spending and saving, and children's ST-TW scores were related to parent reports of children's temperament and financial behavior. Further, children's ST-TW scores were predictive of whether they chose to save or spend money in the lab, even after controlling for age and how much they liked the offered items. Our novel findingsthat children's feelings about spending and saving can be measured from an early age and relate to their behavior with moneyare discussed with regard to theoretical and practical implications.

TI  - Gender differences in risky asset behavior: The importance of self-confidence and financial literacy
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - This paper studies the role of individuals' confidence in own financial literacy in explaining the gender gap in investment in risky assets, while controlling for actual financial literacy and risk aversion. It is the first paper to assess the role of confidence independent of actual financial knowledge for a large set of countries and it is the first to explore the role of confidence by using counterfactual decomposition techniques. Results from our analysis confirm recent findings of modern behavioral finance: confidence is a strong determinant of risky financial behavior and accounts for a large part of the gender gap.

TI  - The roles of peers and social media in building financial literacy among the millennial generation: A case of indonesian economics and business students
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - Students of the millennial generation have several characteristics, including being wasteful in their management of money and being highly dependent on information and communication technology. These phenomena mean financial literacy is important for them, in order that they become capable, wise, and efficient individuals who are future-oriented in managing their personal finances. This study aims to create a model for developing the financial management behavior of students. It covers five variables, namely financial behavior, financial attitude, financial knowledge, social media exposure, and peer influence. By using purposive sampling and a five-point Likert scale questionnaire, this study collected data from 327 students spread across several universities in Indonesia. The results of the descriptive analysis show that the students' financial management behavior (FMB), financial attitude, and financial knowledge are classified as good. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis using the single-composite indicator technique shows that 58% of FMB is influenced by financial exposure from social media, financial attitude, and peer influence. Social media exposure and peer influence take on a strategic nature. Financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial behavior are internal variables related to financial literacy. Further research would need to identify the external variables that have a potential influence on the internal variables of financial literacy.

TI  - Coping Strategies to Improve Financial Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic in an Emerging Economy
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This article examines the influence of financial self-efficacy, financial behavior, financial stress, and financial stressor events on the financial well-being (FWB) of Malaysians during the COVID-19 pandemic. The article then analyzes the moderating effects of three types of coping strategies (self-coping, borrowing, and government aid) on the relationship between financial stress and financial stressor events (income loss, creditor, and legal action stressor events) and FWB. Analyses from a sample of 738 Malaysian working adults indicated that financial self-efficacy and financial behavior were positively related to FWB, while financial stress and financial stressor events were negatively related to FWB. Self-coping and borrowing reduced the negative effect of financial stress on FWB, while the government aid coping strategy reduced the impact of income loss and legal action stressor events on FWB. The study contributes to the literature by examining coping strategies and financial stressor events by three distinct categories in the context of an emerging market.

TI  - A Structural Determinants Framework for Financial Well-Being
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - This study develops a conceptual framework that provides a broad understanding of financial well-being. Using the 2018 National Financial Capability Study and structural equation modeling methods, this study provides empirical evidence for the proposed framework by identifying significant direct and indirect determinants of financial well-being. Previous personal financial wellness and financial satisfaction-related research provides a theoretical rationale for the construction of the conceptual framework in the current study. The results reported the relationships among these determinants, including financial perceptions and knowledge factors, financial stress, short- and long-term positive financial behavior, and financial satisfaction. The findings indicate that financial satisfaction, short-term financial behavior, perceived financial capability showed positive and direct associations with financial well-being, whereas financial stress and long-term financial behavior were negatively and directly associated with financial well-being. Financial perception and knowledge factors, financial stress, and short-term financial behavior also showed significant indirect relationships with financial well-being. The findings of this study contribute to the literature on financial well-being and provide significant policy and practical implications. Implications for financial practitioners and policy makers are discussed.

TI  - Relationship between individual characteristics, neurotic personality, personal financial distress, and financial behavior
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Financial distress is not only experienced by people with no income, but also those with a large income. This research aims to examine the effect of individual characteristics and a neurotic personality on personal financial difficulties with financial behaviour as an intervening variable. The study involved 600 Indonesian respondents. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling-the partial least squares method. The results of this study revealed that at an alpha level of 5%, neurotic traits have significant effects on financial behaviour and personal financial distress. The higher the score of a person's neuroticism, the lower their investment consideration, which consequently leads to the tendency of falling into debt and as a result financial distress. Good financial behaviour can mitigate the financial distress faced by an individual with a high neuroticism score.

TI  - Family financial socialization, financial information seeking behavior and financial literacy among youth
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
AB  - Purpose This study examined the relationship between financial information seeking behavior and financial literacy, as well as the relationship between parents' teaching and behavior with financial information seeking behavior through the factors of the risk information seeking and processing model among youth. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 802 tertiary education students participated in this cross-sectional study. Using covariance-based structural equation modeling, the model was assessed and hypotheses were tested. Findings The results revealed that financial information seeking behavior contributed to youth's financial literacy. While parents' sound financial behavior was directly related to seeking financial information, both parents' financial teaching and behavior indirectly, through the risk information seeking process, encouraged youth to actively seek for financial information. Moreover, parents' financial socialization directly and also indirectly through the risk information seeking and processing model explained youth's financial information avoidance. Among the two parts of the risk information seeking and processing model, planned behavior factors played a more salient role than cognitive need for financial information. Originality/value This study extends the risk information seeking and processing model by integrating family financial socialization to the model and applies it in the context of consumers' financial behavior. The results improve our understanding of the social and psychological mechanism that drives consumers' financial literacy and decision-making.

TI  - Individual-level factors predicting consumer financial behavior at a time of high pressure
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
AB  - Understanding the individual-level factors relating to consumer financial behaviors during periods of distinct pressure to spend may provide new insights as to the particular barriers people face in maintaining better control over their finances. Using Christmas as a focal example of a financially and psychologically pressured time, we collected survey data (N = 294) in the post-Christmas 2013 period, and investigated the extent to which levels of reported spending and borrowing in relation to Christmas could be predicted by sociodemographics, money management behaviors, and psychological factors such as coping style, locus of control, materialism, and spendthrift tendencies. A separate analysis examined the kinds of factors relating more specifically to money management behaviors. Spending was predicted by factors including external locus of control and spendthrift tendency. Emotional coping and denial coping predicted borrowing behavior, as did external locus of control. Money management behaviors predicted who borrowed, but were not related to amount borrowed. Spendthrif tendencies and materialistic values were predictive of less active money management. Our findings suggest that interventions to improve financial decision making might prove more effective if increased emphasis is placed on psychological issues such as developing coping skills and buffering agency.

TI  - Exploring Determinants of Desirable Financial Behaviors Using Decision Tree Analysis Evidence From Four Waves of National Financial Capability Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - The purpose of this article is to utilize decision tree (DT) analysis to examine the relationship between income level, financial satisfaction, financial confidence, financial knowledge, and several demographics with a goal of better understanding desirable financial behavior. The emphasis of this analysis is focused particularly upon better understanding the role of financial knowledge in desirable behavior outcomes. DT analysis is most useful when an analysis includes numerous variables and solving problems where the cumulative learning process is inherent. Our DT analysis of four FINRA National Financial Capability datasets (2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018) suggest that financial knowledge is a relevant variable only under specific circumstances and for respondents with relatively higher income levels. Key variables in the DT analysis included income level and financial satisfaction.

TI  - Left-wing Economic Populism and Savings: How Do Attitudes Influence Forward-Looking Financial Behavior?
T2  - EASTERN EUROPEAN ECONOMICS
AB  - This paper uses the case of Ukraine to explore the association between attitudes and saving behavior. We hypothesize that individuals' preferences and beliefs, which we proxy with support for left-wing populist economic policies, have an adverse effect on strategic, forward-looking behavior. Using the data from a nationally representative survey conducted in 2019, we find that support for populist economic policies has a negative association with a likelihood to have bank savings. The results hold in the presence of socio-economic and behavioral factors and when we remove the variation attributed to the cultural and socio-economic factors from our measure of economic populism.

This study aims to better understand the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of crypto adopters and their financial behavior. Our study advances the knowledge within an array of recent contributions to the token economy and covers the geographical and contextual research gaps through survey data from a developing country in South Eastern Europe. We use descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis and we find that Macedonian crypto-adopters are more men of younger age, employed, with higher education and living in their own apartments in an urban area, and are mainly passive investors. We compare the findings with studies from other countries to provide valuable insights for policymakers and regulators.

The empirical tests for the effect of financial education on financial literacy suggest that women who receive early financial education better understand the compounding effect of interest rates on loans, portfolio diversification, and mortgage payments. The impact of early financial education on financial behavior is also evident in women's increased participation in the stock market, insurance activities, and savings habits. The implications can be used to guide policymakers charged with promoting gender equity through early financial education.

TI  - Talking money at home: the value of family financial socialization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The objective of this study was to empirically examine how family financial socialization affects individuals' financial outcomes, including financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being, based on the family financial socialization theory (FFST). Design/methodology/approach Using a national representative sample of 6,311 US respondents from the 2016 National Financial Well-Being Survey, structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test the hypotheses in this study. Sampling weights were incorporated into the structural model using the maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors and a Satorra-Bentler scaled test statistic (MLM estimation). Findings This study concludes the effectiveness of family financial socialization by showing that parental financial socialization has significant positive impacts on financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being. In addition, parents' education can significantly influence the quality of parental financial socialization. Practical implications The result underscores the importance of financial socialization in the family context and encourages parents to discuss financial matters with their children at home. Detailed implications have been provided to financial educators, practitioners and policymakers to incorporate parental involvement in the design of financial education programs, as well as financial services providers to improve marketing strategies for their banking services. Originality/value This research is amongst the first to empirically explore the relationships among parental financial socialization, financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being based on the FFST. The study also contributes to the literature by confirming the effects of parental socialization received in childhood on adults' later financial outcomes.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of financial attitude and perceived behavioral control with financial behavior in the association between excessive use of social networking sites (SNSs) and financial well-being among working millennials. Design/methodology/approach A crossed-sectional survey was used to obtain data through a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 485 working millennials (M age = 32.28, years, SD age = 4.75) in Malaysia participated in the study based on a purposive sampling technique. Covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) was used to evaluate the measurement model and the proposed serial mediation model. Findings The findings of this study revealed that excessive use of SNS is negatively associated with financial well-being. Also, the findings suggested that financial attitude and perceived behavioral with financial behavior serially mediated the negative relationship between excessive use of SNS and financial well-being, respectively. Practical implications Several implications were suggested and discussed to prevent the negative impact of excessive SNS use on financial well-being among young working adults. Policymakers and financial service providers (e.g. banks) can draw from the findings by constantly framing and delivering their messages to increase the young working adults' awareness of pitfalls of excessive use of innovative technologies on their financial attitudes and self-control over their behaviors and financial well-being. Originality/value This study entails some new insights on examining the impact of excessive use of SNS on working millennials' financial well-being as well as the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - This study investigated the effect of parental financial teaching on college students' financial attitude and behavior and the mediating roles of college students' self-esteem and financial knowledge within these re-lationships. An online survey including questions on demographics, parental financial teaching, self-esteem, financial knowledge, attitude, and behavior was given to a sample of 193 undergraduate and graduate stu-dents at a Midwestern university in the U.S. A model consisting of nine hypotheses reflecting these relationships was established and tested by structural equation modeling. The results revealed that parental financial teaching positively affected financial behavior both directly and indirectly through self-esteem and financial attitude. Most importantly, self-esteem played a mediating role in connecting parental financial teaching to students' financial attitude and behavior, whereas financial knowledge did not play any role. Consequently, this study found that parents' financial teaching positively influences their children's financial attitude and behavior by increasing their self-esteem.

TI  - A Comparison of Financial Well-Being and Its Antecedents Across Different Employment Categories in Malaysia
T2  - GADJAH MADA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS
AB  - This study compares the level of financial well-being (FWB) and its antecedents (financial stress, financial behaviour, financial literacy, and the internal locus of control (LOC)) across individuals of different employment categories in Malaysia. Second, it investigates the relationship between those antecedents and FWB and compares the differences in the strength. Data were collected from 1,867 respondents from four employment groups using a questionnaire-based survey. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted to achieve the first research objective, and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was used to achieve the second research objective. The results indicate that FWB and its antecedents of Malaysian employees vary considerably across employment categories. The FWB of the unemployed and private-sector workers is significantly lower than their government sector and self-employed counterparts. Financial stress, financial behavior, and an internal LOC are the most determinative of employees' FWB, however, they have varying degrees of impact across different employment categories. The results relate to employers and policymakers in formulating strategies to promote higher FWB among Malaysian employees, based on their employment categories.

TI  - Has financial attitude impacted the trading activity of retail investors during the COVID-19 pandemic?
T2  - JOURNAL OF RETAILING AND CONSUMER SERVICES
AB  - Financial attitude influences the financial behavior of retail investors. Although the extant research has acknowledged and examined this relationship, the measures of financial attitude and behavior still vary widely and are generally posed as a series of questions rather than statements. In addition to this, there is insufficient knowledge regarding retail investors' behavior in the face of a health crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study addresses these gaps in the prior literature by examining the relative influence of six dimensions of financial attitude, namely, financial anxiety, optimism, financial security, deliberative thinking, interest in financial issues, and needs for precautionary savings, on the trading activity of retail investors during the pandemic. Data were collected from 404 respondents and analyzed using the artificial neural network (ANN) method. The results revealed that all six dimensions had a positive influence on trading activity, with interest in financial issues exerting the strongest influence, followed by deliberative thinking. The study thus contributes important inferences for researchers and managers.

TI  - Financial literacy and fraud detection*
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - Who is better at detecting fraud? This paper finds that more financially knowledgeable individuals have a higher propensity to detect fraud: a one standard deviation increase in financial knowledge increases fraud detection probabilities by 3 percentage points. The result is not driven by individuals' higher financial product usage and is observed to be moderated by individuals' low subjective well-being, effectively depleting skills to detect fraud. Interestingly, prudent financial behavior relating to basic money management is found to have negligible effects for detecting fraud. The findings attest to the fact that fraud tactics are increasingly complex and it is greater financial knowledge rather than basic money management skills that provide the degree of sophistication necessary to detect fraud. The paper draws policy implications for consumer education programs to go beyond cultivating money management skills, and provide advanced financial knowledge necessary for tackling fraud.

TI  - What drives working adults to be better prepared for their retirements?
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose This study aims to understand the drivers that help working adults to be better prepared for retirement, by examining the relationship between financial literacy (FL), financial attitude (FA), financial well-being (FWB), financial behavior (FB) and retirement preparation (RP). RP includes multidimensional measures, which are retirement confidence, retirement planning, long-term financial planning and private retirement schemes (PRS) participation. Design/methodology/approach This was a quantitative study adopting non-probability sampling with self-administered questionnaire distributed to all working adults. Descriptive analysis was used to examine the 294 useable data, and the multiple logistic regression analysis was adopted for hypothesis testing. Findings The empirical results show that FB is positively associated with RP and then followed by FWB on retirement confidence. Although insignificant influence is found on FL and FA, better FL and FA will still improve individuals' RP. Research limitations/implications The study provides insights to working adults that practicing positive FB and good FWB will improve RP. Besides, for financial institutions, income level is the main determinant for consumers to participate in PRS; for policy makers, to incorporate financial attributes knowledge as part of the school curriculum since early school years. Originality/value This study is one of the few studies in Malaysia that explored FL, FA, FB and FWB on retirement planning, respectively.

TI  - DOES KNOWING YOUR FICO SCORE CHANGE FINANCIAL BEHAVIOR? EVIDENCE FROM A FIELD EXPERIMENT WITH STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS
T2  - REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS
AB  - One in five consumer credit accounts incurs late fees each quarter. Evidence on the efficacy of regulations to improve behavior through enhanced disclosure of financial product attributes is mixed. We test a novel form of disclosure that provides borrowers with a personalized measure of their creditworthiness. In a field experiment with over 400,000 student loan borrowers, treatment group members received communications about the availability of their FICO Score. The intervention significantly reduced late payments and increased borrowers' FICO Scores. Survey data show treatment group members were less likely to overestimate their FICO Scores, suggesting the intervention may correct for overoptimism.

TI  - Financial literacy environment scan in Mozambique
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - This research aims to scan financial literacy in Mozambique, assessing its levels and identifying the sociodemographic factors that influence it, generalizing to the developing countries. Quantitative research was performed using a survey database of 3,875 respondents collected in Mozambique. Our results document that more than 61% of the respondents did not answer correctly the questions regarding financial literacy, which indicates that the levels of financial literacy in Mozambique are low. Individuals are not qualified to make the most appropriate financial decisions and end up compromising their financial well-being. It was also found that age impacts respondents' financial knowledge, gender influences financial behavior, educational level influences financial knowledge and behavior, and the training area influences financial knowledge, attitude, and behavior. This article contributes by providing information regarding the financial literacy of Mozambique, which is still scarce and providing a sci-entific basis for decision-makers to improve public policies regarding financial literacy.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Young Adults' Life Outcomes and Well-Being: Perceived Financial Socialization from Parents, the Romantic Partner, and Young Adults' Own Financial Behaviors
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - We examined how perceived financial socialization-from parents, the romantic partner, and young adults' own behavior-was associated with young adults' life outcomes and well-being (i.e., physical and mental health, finances, romantic relationship). Using data (N = 504) from young adults specific to their finances, results from hierarchical regression analyses showed that young adults' own financial behaviors were the most patterned, followed by financial socialization from the romantic partner, and then from financial socialization from parents (only objective financial knowledge). We discuss how young adults' financial behavior, financial socialization from the romantic partner and, to a lesser extent, parental socialization are associated with young adults' life domains, underscoring the developmental salience of increased financial capability and relationship formation and decreased dependence on parents during the transition to adulthood.

TI  - Financial behavior of cooperatives and investor-owned firms: An empirical analysis of the Spanish fruit and vegetable sector
T2  - AGRIBUSINESS
AB  - A partial adjustment model was formulated to compare financial ratios between cooperatives and investor-owned firms from a dynamic perspective. Empirical results from a sample of Spanish fruit and vegetable firms for the period between 2009 and 2012 reveal different adjustment processes of current, debt, and return on assets ratios between cooperatives and IOFs. We find significant differences between these firms, with slower adjustment rates for current and debt ratios in cooperatives. These findings may arise from the weakness associated with ownership structure in cooperatives, which reduces their adjustment processes compared to those of IOFs. The identification of differences in adjustment processes between cooperatives and IOFs may provide us with additional information regarding the specific management characteristics of these agri-food firms, thus identifying those firms that are most dependent on external market conditions.

TI  - Design and Evaluation among Young Adults of a Financial Literacy Scale Focused on Key Financial Decisions
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - The present study underpins the design and validation of a Financial Literacy (FL) scale in the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) context. Though scales are available, they do not meet contextual characteristics and seem to miss out on a focus on Key Financial Decisions (KFD). Scale design was consistent with an extensive literature review (2010-2021). Forty-four items scale covering the dimensions of Financial Attitude, Financial Behavior, and Financial Knowledge were presented to 478 young adults aged 18-30, and women 58% of them. The results reflect a robust FL scale by applying Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The data about young adults' FL can be used as a benchmark in future studies fostering the development of FL in the Latin American and Caribbean contexts.

TI  - Viewpoint: plotting a way forward for service research in and out of Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - Purpose This study aims to critically evaluate and reflect on the current state of service research in Africa. The purpose is to develop a roadmap to guide future service research in and out of Africa. Design/methodology/approach This study is a conceptual reflection and in situ observation of service research and practice in Africa. Findings This study delineates scholarly, policy and managerial pathways for further service research in the African context. Service research in Africa is often experience-based rather than concept-based, and such research is often conducted in close collaboration with the local business community. Theoretical development and empirical exploration through collaboration initiatives among institutions with mutual research interests are encouraged. Research limitations/implications This study is a theoretical analysis of service research in Africa. Further empirical exploration is needed to delineate service research priorities and methodological directions so as to balance local needs and global relevance. Practical implications Africa represents fertile terrain for experience-based insights regarding financial behavior, ecosystem services and nation branding. Grassroots-level involvement in research represents a key component of managerial relevance. Social implications This study highlights the role of service research in and about Africa. The discussion demonstrates that the African Ubuntu values of community involvement and a collectivist orientation can expand the relevance of research from the academic business field to broader society. Originality/value This study represents a unique perspective on service research in the African context. In doing so, this paper lays the groundwork for more meaningful participation on the part of African-based researchers in the global service research domain. Experience-based research projects focusing on the empirical starting point complement theory development and serve as useful anchors for theory implementation in practice.

TI  - Digital financial services usage and subjective financial well-being: evidence from low-income households in Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThe first objective of this study is to analyze whether financial behavior (FB), financial stress (FS), financial literacy (FINLIT) and the locus of control (LOC) influence subjective financial well-being (SFWB) among low-income households in Malaysia. The second objective is to investigate whether the use of digital financial services (DFS) moderates the influence of FB and FS, on SFWB.Design/methodology/approachMotivated by the literature on transformative service research (TRS), this study examines how the use of DFS impact SFWB among low-income households in Malaysia. Low-income households are chosen as they are more likely to be financially excluded and lack financial knowledge and skills. Using an interviewer-administered survey, trained enumerators collected data from 1,948 low-income households in Malaysia, selected using a two-stage sampling based on the National Household Sampling Frame obtained from the Department of Statistics Malaysia.FindingsResults reveal that SFWB is positively influenced by FB and the LOC, and is negatively impacted by FS and FINLIT. The evidence shows that the use of DFS counterintuitively weakened the strength of the relationship between FB and SFWB, but effectively reduced the adverse effect of FS on SFWB.Practical implicationsTo reverse the signs of relationship, financial services marketers need to identify the specific types of DFS that low-income households use in order to provide targeted marketing efforts and financial education to promote the use of DFS on a more holistic basis to increase financial well-being.Originality/valueThe findings of this study add to the body of knowledge deliberating on the opposing effects of technology on consumers' welfare and well-being. This study focuses on the lower-income stratum of Malaysian households as this group of the population is more likely to be financially excluded and have deficiencies in financial knowledge and skills. Findings of this study show that DFS use can actually diminish the positive impact of FB on SFWB while reducing the adverse effect of FS on SFWB.

TI  - Gender, Education, and Financial Socialization as Determinants of Financial Knowledge: An Empirical Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The main aim of the paper is to assess the level of financial literacy among business students. It further aims to investigate the role of external factors that may determine financial literacy. The external factors considered in this study are gender, grade point average, specialization, financial education, and financial socialization. Standard scales such as the Test of Financial Literacy, the Big Three, and other instruments were adapted to measure Financial Knowledge. Further, the study also explored relationships between several factors and the financial knowledge of students. These factors included a student's gender, specialization, number of finance or related courses studied, current Grade Point Average, and financial socialization. A total number of 303 valid responses were received through an online questionnaire administered to business students studying in a public university in the country. Statistical tests namely independent samples t-Test, one-way ANOVA, and correlation analysis were performed in SPSS 28.0. Results show that the overall financial knowledge of students is above average. Gender, number of finance or related courses, and financial socialization do not exhibit any significant relationship with financial knowledge. Current GPA and specialization show significant relationships. The findings of this study have important sectoral and research implications.

TI  - The Association Between Financial Activities and Self-Rated Health in Middle-Aged and Older Adults
T2  - REVIEW OF PACIFIC BASIN FINANCIAL MARKETS AND POLICIES
AB  - The extant literature has provided a lot of evidence that supports positive associations between participation in activities and health. However, the health effects of high or low risk financial activities (FAs) are presently ambiguous, especially across age groups. With a sample of 313 subjects in Taiwan, this study examines whether participation in high or low risk FAs (savings, stocks, mutual funds, and real estate) benefits self-rated health (SRH) in middle-aged and older adults. We find that (1) savings rates are consistently high for both middle-aged and older cohorts. However, middle-aged adult participation rate in FAs, in terms of stocks, mutual funds and real estate, is higher than that for older adults. (2) High risk FAs, especially stock investments, have a positive effect on SRH in middle-aged adults.

TI  - Is Crowdfunding Different? Evidence on the Relation between Gender and Funding Success from a German Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform
T2  - GERMAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - According to the literature on traditional banking, lenders often discriminate against female borrowers. However, studies of Peer-to-Peer lending in the United States find that female borrowers have better chances of obtaining funds than do males. We provide evidence on the success of female borrowers at a large German peer-to-peer lending platform. Our results show that there is no effect of gender on the individual borrower's chance to receive funds on this platform, ceteris paribus. Several robustness checks confirm this finding. Hence, female discrimination seems to be eased by the wisdom of the lending crowd'.

TI  - How do demographic and socioeconomic factors affect financial literacy and its variables?
T2  - COGENT BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate various relationships between demographic and socioeconomic factors and financial literacy variables. Instead of using two or three variables as commonly adopted in the literature, this study employed multivariable analysis to investigate financial literacy. The sample of this research was 255 faculty members on Java Island, Indonesia. This study was a discrete moderator test; therefore, it employed a multigroup analysis (MGA) via the partial least squares of structural equations modeling (PLS-SEM) to determine which group of demographics and socioeconomic factors influencing the relationship of the financial literacy variables. This study revealed that demographic factors of sex, age, and specialization affected different relationship of financial skills, knowledge, capability, awareness, experience, goal, and financial decision. This study also provided empirical evidence that the socioeconomic factor of consumption spending affected the different relationships between financial awareness and skills. The results proved that demographic and socioeconomic factors enhanced financial literacy. Assessing financial literacy levels in different demographic and socioeconomic factors, as a key factor in accomplishing a successful national strategy for financial education, allows policymakers to identify gaps and design appropriate responses. This result emphasizes that strengthening awareness and experience as future orientations could improve financial literacy levels in developing countries.

Combination of objective financial knowledge, financial attitudes and financial behaviors constructed financial capability. Results indicate that business students are more financially capable than non-business students. The result of the study reveals that Master's degree level education in finance has significant positive impact on financial capability as compared with study of finance in other education levels. The financial education index has highly significant positive impact on financial knowledge, financial attitudes and financial capability index. However, financial education does not improve the financial behaviors of young adults. Moreover, the results also revealed that degree in finance has positive association with financial capability.

TI  - The Business Strategy, Competitive Advantage and Financial Strategy: A Perspective from Corporate Maturity Mismatched Investment
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPETITIVENESS
AB  - Competitive advantage is the key to a company's success, and the business strategy represents a long-term plan to achieve a competitive advantage by affecting the company's financial behavior. This research studies the interaction of business strategy, competitive advantage, and financial strategy to explore whether companies choose different financial strategies based on their business strategies as well as what role competitive advantage plays in their decision-making. By building a composite index and observing maturity mismatched investment, this research quantifies the risk level of business strategies and financial strategies. Using text analysis of a company's annual report, the research builds a dummy variable to measure the competitive advantage. Based on the samples of A-shares listed on the China Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2007 to 2016, the research shows that the risk level of business strategy and financial strategy tends to move in opposite directions. If a company embraces an aggressive business strategy, it is more likely to choose a conservative financial approach in terms of lower overall risks, but for the company with a competitive advantage, the negative correlation between these two strategies is weakened. Further analysis found that company ownership, free cash flow, and the quality of internal control also play a significant role in the interaction between business strategy and financial strategy. Our findings not only enrich research on business strategy and financial behavior, but also deepen the understanding of competitive advantage and corporate financial strategy theoretically.

TI  - Prudent Financial Management Practices among Malaysian Youth: The Moderating Roles of Financial Education
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The study aims to investigate the roles of financial education (FE) as a moderator to financial attitude (FA), parental financial socialisation (PFS), and financial literacy (FL) to ensure the success of prudent financial management practices (PFMP) among Malaysian youth. The study was designed quantitatively and employed self-administered questionnaires, which were adopted from previous studies and distributed to 480 youths in Malaysia. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test hypotheses of the study. The results showed FA, PFS and FL have significant and positive relationship with PFMP. However, as regards moderating interaction of FE, results showed that FE does not significantly moderate the relationship between FA, PFS and FL with PFMP. The results further highlighted serious concerns on the effectiveness of FE towards improving youth capability in managing their financial affairs prudently. This proved that mandated FE prior to graduation has less effect and does not lead to behavior changes among Malaysian youth. It shows the challenges faced by the country stakeholders to strengthen FE, enhance the effectiveness and encompass the right FE elements to ensure today's young Malaysians are able to apply what they learned in the classroom to their real life.

Data were collected from investors in Lebanon, which could limit the generalization of the research results across the MENA region.FindingsInvestors differed from non-investors in that they were male, owned investments in the stock, bond and commodity markets, had prior investment experience in cryptocurrencies, were risk-takers and had expectations of high returns. Investors increased the dollar investment in cryptocurrencies, if they were male, as they invested more funds in securities, had previously invested in cryptocurrencies and had stronger risk-taking propensity. Expectations of high returns drove investors to cryptocurrencies, but such expectations do not stimulate further cryptocurrency investment.Originality/valueThis study is an initial attempt to comprehend the reactions of investors in the MENA region to a currency crisis that triggered investment in cryptocurrencies following the collapse of fiat currencies, central bank default and restrictions on bank withdrawals.

TI  - Development of a Responsible Financial Behaviors Index
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - Bridging the gap between theory and practice, this study yielded a reliable and valid measure for responsible financial behaviors with the potential to serve practitioners when working with consumers. This research utilized Bandura's Triadic Model of Causation (Bandura, 1985) to investigate and predict responsible financial behaviors. Data from the 2009, 2012, and 2018 National Financial Capability Study surveys were used to construct a responsible financial behaviors index with five subconstructs for time horizon, money management, risk management, debt awareness, and ownership of baseline financial accounts. Results from a series of regression models identified consistent relationships between the index and variables categorized as cognitive factors (financial knowledge, financial self-efficacy, and financial risk tolerance) and background characteristics (educational attainment, income, and marital status).

TI  - The nexus of financial literacy and depositor discipline in commercial banks
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose This study investigates the relationship between financial literacy, that is, financial knowledge and financial skills, and market discipline, with financial behavior as the mediating variable. The study uses data from Indonesian depositors in commercial banks to estimate the relationship between the variables. Design/methodology/approach This study applied an explanatory method with a quantitative approach by surveying 343 Indonesian commercial bank depositors, in both public and private banks. The responses were collected using the purposive sampling technique. This study applied structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS software to analyze the data and then to estimate the relationships between financial literacy and market discipline. Findings This study shows that financial knowledge, financial skills, and financial behavior can improve market discipline. This study also provides empirical evidence that financial behavior has a mediation effect on the relationship between financial skills and financial knowledge to the market discipline. Research limitations/implications The results show that all financial literacy latent variables have a significant positive effect on market discipline. Financial behavior has a mediation effect on the relationship of financial skills and financial knowledge with market discipline. Depositors with good knowledge of financial products and services, who are skillful in managing their money and who demonstrate good financial behavior can effectively discipline the market. They will punish imprudent banking by actions such as the withdrawal of their funds. Financial literacy significantly enhances market discipline. Practical implications This study provides recommendations for regulators, practitioners, academics, and depositors, that is, the actors in the financial industry, on the need to empower consumers with financial literacy, while also promoting market discipline to recognize the importance of these two aspects for the sustainability of financial stability. Originality/value This study provides empirical evidence for the market discipline literature, using a behavioral approach, namely, the action of withdrawal of funds. The study then estimates the relationship between financial literacy, that is, financial knowledge and financial skills, and market discipline, with financial behavior as the mediating variable.

TI  - Financial life-skills training and labor market outcomes in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION
AB  - This study examines the relationship between a United States Agency for International Development financial life skills training program for poor and vulnerable youth in Indonesia on labor market outcomes two years following the training. Longitudinal results indicate that self-efficacy and financial behaviors improved from pre-training to two years after the training, and a logistic regression analysis finds significant correlations between self-efficacy and financial behaviors with finding new or better employment. Because financial literacy education can be associated with improved financial behaviors, and soft skills acquisition can be associated with improved self-efficacy, we conclude that the training program led indirectly to new or better employment outcomes for participants. Reinforcing this result, between 92 % and 97 % of the trained youth attributed the training program to their observed improvements in work performance and/or to new or better employment opportunities.

TI  - Do we really need financial literacy to access the behavioral dynamics of generation Z? A case of Oman
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - The ability to manage money has been identified as a vital talent. In this context, financial literacy has a role to play. There are significant gaps, though, such as the financial connection to human behavior. The purpose of this study is to look at the overall effects of financial literacy (FL) on the behavioural aspects of materialism (ML), compulsive buying (CB), and tendency to debt (TD). It attempts to develop and evaluate a model that is based on these variables and to examine the relationships between these research constructs. The study looked at 233 respondents mainly students studying in Omani universities. A comprehensive literature review, confirmatory factorial analysis, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), and comprehensive analysis were used to develop research hypotheses. The primary findings suggested that financial literacy had the most significant impact on compulsive purchasing behaviour in comparison to materialism and the propensity to accumulate debt, among the direct relationships that were suggested. The study's findings have important implications for the formulation of public policy and other interested parties, as financial literacy is advantageous for individuals with poor financial health and facilitates the participation in other psychological behaviours.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We study the rapidly growing literature on the causal effects of financial education programs in a meta-analysis of 76 randomized experiments with a total sample size of over 160,0 0 0 individuals. Many of these experiments are published in top economics and finance journals. The evidence shows that financial education programs have, on average, positive causal treatment effects on financial knowledge and downstream financial behaviors. Treatment effects are economically meaningful in size, similar to those realized by educational interventions in other domains, and robust to accounting for publication bias in the literature. We also discuss the cost-effectiveness of financial education interventions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hadith Corresponding Thoughts on the Ethical Interacting Behavior of Young Entrepreneurs in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The youths are characterized by their reckless and ambitious behavior. They exhibit a strong tendency to make risky decisions that may jeopardize their future. These qualities are also in line with their experience-seeking behavior. As young entrepreneurs aim high in profit-seeking activities, their ethical stance may be compromised. Moreover, their money profile increases at an accelerated pace, leading them to love money even more. Quantitatively, this study was the first to investigate the behavior of young entrepreneurs in terms of their love of money, religiosity, and ethical perceptions by adopting the hadith perspective in Islamic tradition by developing the scales of all constructs. The respondents were 261 members of the Indonesian Young Entrepreneur Association in Sulawesi Selatan, Indonesia. This study also examined gender as the moderating variable. This study found that the love of money affects ethical perception negatively; on the other hand, religiosity positively affected ethics. Gender is found to moderate religiosity, but not love of money. These results signify the harmful impact of loving money too much on young entrepreneurs' ethics; furthermore, the scales developed from hadith revelation were able to capture the empirical findings significantly.

TI  - Behavioral control or income? An analysis of saving attitudes and behavior, credit card use and buying on installment
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-REVUE EUROPEENNE DE PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE
AB  - Introduction. - The Turkish economy has gone through multiple economic crises, marked on the one hand by a volatile trend in the national financial system, and on the other, by the introduction of credit cards and payment facilities for consumer goods that are extremely easy to obtain.
   Objective. - Inspired by previous research on saving attitudes, motivations, and behavior, this study explores the perceptions of consumption conducted using credit, either in the form of referred monthly payments or credit cards in the Turkish context.
   Method. - To analyze the possible relations between saving attitudes, behaviors and new payment methods, a survey was conducted in Istanbul, with a convenience sample of independent professionals, managers and executives, and small business owners (n=173). Their attitudes and behavior toward saving, buying on installment, credit card use and debt were combined with measures of self-reported control over spending.
   Results. - Results show that self-reported control variables have some effects on the relationship between saving attitudes and actual saving behavior, concurring with Ajzen's model of planned behavior, but only if income is high.
   Conclusion. - Positive and negative attitudes towards buying on instalment and credit card use are not correlated with saving attitudes or behavior. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to determine the factors that influence ethical banking behavior among millennials and Gen-Z in Malaysia.Design/methodology/approachA stratified sample of 525 millennials and Gen-Z of Malaysian banking customers was used. Extended ethical decision-making (EDM) model was tested using partial least square-structural equation model for the analysis.FindingsThe findings indicated that the engagement of millennials and Gen-Z in ethical banking is influenced by factors such as intention, judgment and awareness, which shaped both generations' ethical banking behavior.Practical implicationsThis study could be a central reference point and assist banking institutions in understanding the preferences of millennials and Gen-Z.Originality/valueThis study extends the previous EDM model that focused solely on consumer's belief systems. Three aspects differentiate this paper and contribute to its originality, namely, the uniqueness of millennials and Gen-Z behavior, incorporating new variables along with the EDM models and study in Malaysian context.

TI  - An Empirical Study on the Role of Socioeconomic Status and Demographic Factors on Financial Literacy of Engineering Students
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This research sought to investigate how financial literacy among engineering students in Uttar Pradesh, India, is influenced by socioeconomic status and demographic variables. A sum of 478 questionnaires was gathered from graduating engineers across multiple colleges and universities. IBM SPSS version 23.0 was employed for the analysis of the collected data, and chi-square techniques were utilized to examine the findings. The outcomes of the study indicated that there was no noteworthy association between gender and financial literacy among engineering students. However, caste, parents' occupation, family income, and parent's education levels demonstrated a substantial influence on the financial literacy of engineering students. Additionally, higher GPAs were correlated with increased levels of financial literacy. These results can aid in the development of focused interventions by educators and policymakers to raise engineering students' financial literacy levels. Overall, the study provides significant insights into the relationship between financial understanding, demographic variables as well as socioeconomic factors among engineering students, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to improve financial literacy levels among this population.

TI  - Disposition Effect in Currency Trading: an Evidence from Experimental Student Games
T2  - REVISTA DE CERCETARE SI INTERVENTIE SOCIALA
AB  - The disposition effect has been described in the stock-investing context as a behavioral tendency of investors to hold on to losing stocks for too long and sell winning stocks too soon. In this paper it is examined whether the disposition effect can be confirmed also in the experimental student game of currency trading data set. The presence of the disposition effect leads to the conclusion that students, despite using demo money, were trading with real behavioral bias and various interesting findings concerning gender differences and size of the trade are discussed. The experimental data set was collected by Jochec during years 2009 to 2015, students were trading under standardized rules. In this paper the holding periods of profitable and unprofitable trades were tested and compared. Based on these calculations the general presence of the disposition effect in the data set was confirmed. Moreover it was confirmed that males and females have different tendency to succumb to this bias.

TI  - What Factors Predict a Positive Change in a Consumer's Financial Capability over Time? The New Evidence from Poland
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - Despite the significant attention that financial capability has received in the last 20 years, many of its aspects are poorly understood, and the term itself is ambiguously defined. Consequently, different measures of financial capability are used in empirical research creating a tendency to let the data dictate the conceptualization of the financial capability itself. This creates concerns about the reliability of the general findings for countries in Eastern Europe such as Poland. Therefore, the following study is carried out to address these limitations and contribute to the advancement of the literature on financial capability, first, by extending the mainstream of the theoretical work on financial capability with the conceptual proposition framed within Sen's Capability Approach; second, by proposing the measurement model of financial capability; and third, by using data from the Polish household panel study, Social Diagnosis (SD), to identify factors which predict a positive change in consumer's financial capability over time. Across these three aims, we found that higher income was a key predictor and substantially improved financial capability in Poland. We also showed the strong and positive link between financial capability and all included psychological variables. Our findings also highlighted the differential impact of demographic variables on financial capability. The findings of this study yield implications for scholars who would like to analyze financial capability in transition or developing countries, but are constrained by limited financial resources to create their own database or have no access to national financial capability studies.

TI  - Intergenerational bankruptcy risks: Learning from parents' mistakes*
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION
AB  - This study investigates inter-generational transmissions of parental bankruptcy shock on children's financial behavior in adulthood. Our results show that younger children who were 9 years or below when their parents declared bankruptcy were 2-3 % points less likely to declare bankruptcy than their older siblings who were 10 years and older when the parents' bankruptcy event occurred. We rule out alternative hypotheses, including birth order, cohort effects, and truncated sample bias. We find corroborative evidence for the "parent socialization" channel, where bankrupt parents, through interactions with children during childhood years, influence their financial behavior and reduce the risks of their children repeating the same mistakes in adulthood.

TI  - MODERN STATE AND POST-WAR PROSPECTS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN UKRAINE CONSIDERING THE EU EXPERIENCE
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - The purpose of the article is theoretical and methodological substantiation of the state and post-war prospects of financial inclusion in Ukraine, taking into account the experience of EU countries. The objectives of the study are as follows: to theoretically substantiate the content and features of financial inclusion, taking into account the experience of EU countries; to assess the current state of financial inclusion; and to outline post-war prospects for the development of financial inclusion in Ukraine. It is argued that the key parameters of financial inclusion are financial well-being, financial behaviour, financial knowledge, and the utilization of financial products, as well as physical access to financial services. Drawing on the experience of EU countries, it is substantiated that creating conditions for free access to financial services for all categories of the population and businesses, as well as their digitalization, contribute to the growth of citizens' income, the simplification of investment mechanisms, and thus the economic development of the country. An assessment of the state of financial inclusion in Ukraine is conducted through online surveys of various categories of citizens. It is determined that Ukrainians feel a strong need for additional sources of income, and the financial situation of the majority of them is extremely unstable. Based on the results of correlation-regression analysis, the priorities of financial inclusion are identified as the level of financial literacy and competency among the population. This will enable them to budget their income and expenses, promote the transformation of savings into investments, and have a positive impact on the post-war recovery of the country's economy.

TI  - Towards Sustainable Retirement Planning of Wageworkers in Thailand: A Qualitative Approach in Behavioral Segmentation and Financial Pain Point Identification
T2  - RISKS
AB  - Thailand recently reached "aged" society status, signifying that over twenty percent of the population is over sixty. Considering that Thailand has a low literacy rate, a fractured pension system, and no regulations that could provide sufficient income to cover basic needs after retirement, there will be economic repercussions if the situation is not handled soon. The government and financial institutions have been encouraging Thai citizens to prepare retirement plans but lack understanding of the root causes of being unprepared for retirement. The objectives of this qualitative research were to explore the behavior, knowledge, and preparedness towards retirement in governmental and private wageworkers. Moreover, the study aims to identify the pain points of being unprepared for retirement and deliver the optimal solutions and sustainable retirement plans suitable for each segment. This article employed a sample of 46 wageworkers in Khon Kaen, Thailand with ages ranging from 20 to 59 years old. Qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews and qualitative content analysis were conducted with the respondents asking about their income, expenses, pains, and problems towards saving for retirement, their desired outcome after they retire, and how they would achieve it. The framework used for the in-depth qualitative interview was by utilizing the customer, problem, and solution zoom tool. The research contributions were to facilitate Thai citizens being ready for retirement stages and overcome post-retirement risks sustainably. The results revealed that the sample could be divided into four segments by their characteristics. Two low-income segments share the same traits and behaviors that can prove that financial literacy plays an essential role in retirement readiness. Lower-income wage workers do not have their money put in place to prepare for retirement. Additionally, this article discussed the study's implications for wageworkers, employers, and the Thai government. This article recommended that Thai citizens should accumulate wealth in various ways, including investment in financial assets and earning additional income from a second job. Employers should provide suitable retirement contribution schemes. The government should launch a policy enabling above-60-year-old seniors to continue working.

TI  - Financial literacy: Thai middle-class women do not lag behind
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - This research studies the stylized fact of a "gender gap'' in that women tend to have lower financial literacy than men. Our data which samples middle-class people from Bangkok does not show a gender gap for those with at least minimum wage earnings. This result is not explained by men's low financial literacy, nor by women's high income and good education. Rather, country characteristics may influence finance-specific gender equality, such as Thailand's small gender gaps in pupils' mathematics abilities and secondary school enrollment, and women's strong role in financial affairs. This may indicate ways to reduce the gender gap in financial literacy elsewhere. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The psychological antecedents of personal financial management behavior: a meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The intent of this study is to aggregate, in a measurable form, the results of previous studies on the association between personal financial management behavior (PFMB) and six psychological factors, which are financial attitude, financial self-efficacy, self-control, materialism, internal locus of control (LOC), and external LOC. Design/methodology/approach A stack of 32 research documents that investigated 52 relationships between various psychological variables and PFMB was analyzed using the meta-analysis technique. Along with the overall meta-analysis, a comprehensive subgroup analysis was also undertaken counseled to determine whether the results contrast on account of the age group of the sample and the economy of the country to which the sample belongs. Findings The overall meta-analysis findings do not support the association between PFMB and the various explanatory variables except for the significant positive association with self-control. In contrast, a subgroup study revealed that self-control (positively) and materialism (negatively) were found to be significantly associated with PFMB among adults. The association between internal LOC and PFMB is significant and positive among the young. Interestingly, self-control appeared to be significantly and positively associated with PFMB in developed countries. In developing countries, financial attitude, financial self-efficacy and internal LOC are significantly and positively associated with PFMB. Originality/value Distinct from other review papers, this meta-analysis quantitatively cumulates and reconciles the conflicting findings on the linkage between psychological predictors and PFMB. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis on the topic.

The analysis examines Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data containing more than 20 information search methods used by households for saving and investment decisions. We classify investors into categories (informal, professional, and comprehensive) based on information search method. We use the 2016 SCF data for our main results; we also use the 1998 SCF to examine the effects of geography and changes in information search over time. We find that information search method influences financial decisions about stock market participation, trading, diversification, risk-taking, and home bias.

TI  - Robo-Advising Risk Profiling through Content Analysis for Sustainable Development in the Hong Kong Financial Market
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Nowadays, we mainly depend on financial consultants or advisors to conduct risk assessments for individual investors before providing them with any investment advice or recommendations. Individual investors should understand the risk level of their investment choices and their investment decisions should match their risk profile. This process is usually conducted in face-to-face meetings. However, during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which has seriously impacted daily life with social distancing, in order to maintain sustainability, contact-free advising, such as robo-advising, becomes more important. The aim of this paper was to assess customers' risk in regards to investment and identify important risk factors needed to profile individual risk preferences, in order to prepare for robo-advising. Inductive content analysis is applied to classify 180 questions from 20 risk assessment questionnaires, sourced from banks and investment service providers, into different types. Then, the number of types is reduced by collapsing similar areas into broader higher order categories (the important risk factors). This paper also makes specific recommendations for the implementation of risk profiling in robo-advising.

TI  - Family Communication, Resources, and Income in Adolescence and Financial Behaviors in Young Adulthood
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This research examined how parental communication and family resources provided during adolescence relate to domain-specific financial management behaviors for a sample of 1,245 young adults age 18-34. Using data collected by an online survey administration organization, bivariate analysis results indicated that higher levels of parental communication about proper consumer skills and tangible and intangible family resources were associated with better financial behaviors. Financial behaviors were also found to vary significantly across different levels of family income. Multivariate regression analyses revealed two noteworthy interactions in which intangible resources and financial behaviors varied by level of family income. Better financial behaviors in adulthood were associated with more intangible resources for middle- and upper-income families during adolescence. The reverse was indicated for young adults from lower income families. Control variables of education level, employment status, and gender also showed significance with financial behaviors.

TI  - Does self-control constitute a driver of millennials' financial behaviors and attitudes?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Millennials are currently facing particular financial challenges that will condition the future financial well-being of the society as a whole, and the decision-making process happening in worse circumstances than those of preceding generations. However, few studies to date have deeply analyzed millennials' financial behaviors, and particularly, how self-control operationalizes their financial choices. Using data from the 2017 Survey of Financial Competences of Spanish individuals, this paper analyzes how self-control influences different financial behaviors and attitudes and whether this effect differs between millennials and older generations. The results indicate that self-control does influence the individuals' financial attitudes regardless of generation, whereas in the case of financial behaviors, only those millennials exhibiting the highest levels of self-control are affected by it when deciding on a saving account or a personal loan. These outcomes have numerous significant implications, in addition to providing recommendations to policy makers aimed at engaging millennials in healthier financial behaviors.

TI  - How to Deter Financial Misconduct if Crime Pays?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB  - Financial misconduct has come into the spotlight in recent years, causing market regulators to increase the reach and severity of interventions. We show that at times the economic benefits of illicit financial activity outweigh the costs of litigation. We illustrate our argument with data from the US Securities and Exchanges Commission and a case of investment misconduct. From the neoclassical economic paradigm, which follows utilitarian thinking, it is rational to engage in misconduct. Still, the majority of professionals refrain from misconduct, foregoing economic rewards. We suggest financial activity could be reimagined taking into account intrinsic and prosocial motivations. A virtue ethics framework could also be applied, linking financial behavior to the quest for moral excellence and shared flourishing. By going beyond utilitarian thinking and considering alternative models, we offer a fuller account of financial behavior and a better perspective from which to design deterrence methods.

TI  - Financial Management Behavior Among Young Adults: The Role of Need for Cognitive Closure in a Three-Wave Moderated Mediation Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This three-wave study aims to explore whether the impact of investment literacy on the financial management behavior is mediated by investment advice use and moderated by the need for cognitive closure. A total number of 272 financially independent adults, under 40 years, completed questionnaires at three different times with 3-month intervals. The results reveal that employees with more investment advice use and characterized by high need for cognitive closure show a higher level of financial management behavior, in relation to both the urgency (seizing) of getting knowledge and the permanence (freezing) of such knowledge. The present study contributes to better understand how and when investment literacy drives well-informed and responsible financial behavior. According to these results, interventions to improve financial behavior should focus on the combination of investment advice use and metacognitive strategies used by individuals to make financial decisions.

TI  - Personal Emotions and Family Financial Well-Being: Applying the Broaden and Build Theory
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - The purpose of this article is to show that emotions matter when predicting the financial well-being of U.S. households. The broaden and build theory (BBT) was used to predict that positive emotions would be positively associated with financial well-being and negative emotions would be negatively associated with financial wellbeing. Using a convenience sample of 993 US adults, emotions were found to explain the variation in family financial well-being, measured by income and net worth, of U.S. households beyond demographic variables. More specifically, feelings of contentment, love, anger, anxiety, and loneliness were found to be associated with financial well-being. Results suggest that policymakers, financial professionals, and academics should collect more data on the emotions of individuals to help explain the variation in the financial well-being of U.S. households. Results also provide evidence in support of the financial counseling industry's efforts to incorporate emotions as an important variable when modeling family financial well-being.

TI  - Unraveling the impact of financial literacy on investment decisions in an emerging market
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We examined the impact of financial literacy on investment decisions, taking a sample of 384 investors from India. A multi-dimensional construct to measure financial literacy was developed basis the theory of planned behavior. Investment decisions were measured by taking six proxies on a five-point Likert-type scale. The causal link between financial literacy and investment decisions was examined using simple linear and binary logistic regression. The results exhibited moderate to high levels of financial literacy among investors. Results further confirm that investors' investment decisions are positively influenced by their financial literacy levels. It is concluded that financial literates have a greater likelihood of making informed investment decisions. These outcomes have practical implications for policymakers, managers, employers, and investors, especially in an emerging market context, making a case for relevant financial education programs to empower investors. The study adds to the theory of financial literacy developing a multi-dimensional construct and introducing Macroeconomic Factors as a proxy for investment decisions.

TI  - Cooperative Banks' Business Model at the Crossroads between Financial Performance and Societal Involvement
T2  - EKONOMICKY CASOPIS
AB  - In the aftermath of the financial crisis the European financial system, particularly banks, still struggles to recover the lost public confidence. Ethical financial behavior and customer centricity have gained weight, not only from the viewpoint of banking customers, but also from international organizations' one. The paper aims at analyzing the strengths and challenges associated with a different banking model, namely the cooperative banks' one, in terms of its ability to maintain its genuine, cooperative principles. The paper provides a comprehensive insight into the intrinsic financial indicators and their evolution over time. The descriptive statistics analysis comprises the 23 member organizations of European Association of Co-operative Banks, which represent the cooperative banks operating in EU countries, to have a complete picture of their positioning, in terms of market share, liquidity, capitalization and contribution to the domestic financial depth. Secondly, we conducted an exploratory approach named Cluster Analysis, for two years of reference, in order to identify most resembling business models and gather them in the same cluster. The results emphasized which cooperative member organizations still follow the original cooperative business model and mission, and which of them have migrated towards a more commercial banking one.

TI  - Development of a Battery for the Measurement of Financial Capabilities in Young People
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - Measuring financial capabilities among young people poses a challenge for scholars. In this study, we developed a set of ten scales to assess various behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the construct. We designed a pool of items and invited 746 participants, aged 16 to 29, who were divided into two groups for studying the psychometric properties of the tests. The first group underwent an Exploratory Factor Analysis, while the second group underwent a Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Through these analyses, we identified five dimensions of financial behaviors, four dimensions of financial attitudes, and one dimension of knowledge or financial literacy. The scales were combined to measure two financial capabilities: Financial Saving Capability and Responsible Debt Management Capability. Furthermore, we identified distinct profiles of young people associated with each proposed financial capability. Finally, we offer a conceptual discussion of the financial capabilities construct, present scales with reliable and valid measurements, and propose avenues for future research.

TI  - Is Financial Literacy Dangerous? Financial Literacy, Behavioral Factors, and Financial Choices of Households
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE JAPANESE AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES
AB  - Using original purpose-built 2018 Japanese survey data, we estimate the financial behaviors and attitudes of households. We find that financial literacy plays an important and consistent role in financial decision-making. However, the actual behaviors are counter-intuitive: people with high levels of financial literacy tend to take too many risks, overborrow, and hold naive financial attitudes. That is, financial literacy tends to cause people to become daring and reckless toward some financial aspects. By contrast, financially literate people are better at retirement planning and are indifferent to gambling. Preferences such as risk and loss aversions and discount factors, also play a role in financial choices.

TI  - Web Application Commercial Design for Financial Entities Based on Business Intelligence
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB  - Multiple customer data management has become a focus of attention in big organizations. Although much information is available, it does not translate into significant profitable value-added services. We present a design of a commercial web application based on business intelligence that generates information on social and financial behavior of clients in an organization; with the purpose of obtain additional information that allows to get more profits. This app will provide a broader perspective for making strategic decisions to increase profits and reduce internal investment costs. A case in point is the financial sector, a group of financial entities were used to make measurements and test them. A design to build a web application aimed at achieving a large and ambitious goal by means of defined tools reflecting clients' business needs is proposed. In this research, different techniques and technologies are explored, such as diagrams, frameworks, design, architecture, model entity-relationship, tables, equations, mental maps and development tools. Through the Personal Software Process methodology and with the help of information extraction, consolidation, and visualization, the implementation can be carried out. This article provides the importance of implementing business intelligence in an organization and expands on the steps needed for the implementation of this valuable technology.

TI  - The moderating effects of financial broad-scope trust on consumer knowledge, cognitive effort, and financial healthiness
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR
AB  - Substantial research results suggest the global financial crisis has negatively affected consumers' trust in financial service providers. Notably, trust not only relates to consumer trust in individual companies but also relates to the broader business context in which consumers may plan and carry out their financial behavior. This latter form of trust can be referred to as "broad-scope" trust (BST). BST is especially important in a society context because lack of BST may reduce financial market dynamism, competition, and productivity. Consequently, financial service providers assume an important social responsibility in order to develop BST. Unfortunately, not much is known about the interplay between BST and consumer financial behavior. Based on two surveys comprising 1155 bank consumers and 756 mutual fund investors, respectively, this study investigates the moderating influence of BST on relations between knowledge, cognitive effort, and financial healthiness and also examines the direct influence of BST on cognitive effort and financial healthiness. The results indicate that BST negatively moderates relations between knowledge and financial healthiness and between cognitive effort and financial healthiness. In addition, it is demonstrated that BST negatively influences cognitive effort and positively influences financial healthiness. Our results demonstrate the importance of developing BST as it may ease the burdens put on consumers' financial knowledge and processing capabilities, which in turn may facilitate their financial well-being.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - Self-leadership examines how individuals can motivate themselves through behavior focused strategies, constructive thought patterns, and natural reward strategies. This study examined the potential influence of self-leadership on financial self-efficacy, credit card debt, and student loan debt among college students. Data were collected from a survey of 197 graduate and undergraduate students at a major Midwestern university. The findings suggest students higher in self-leadership tend to have lower student loan debt. Additionally, financial self-efficacy and credit card debt mediate the relationship between self-leadership and student loan debt. The results have implications for the role self-leadership plays in credit card debt, financial self-efficacy, and student loan debt.

TI  - Health insurance satisfaction, financial burden, locus of control and quality of life of cancer patients: a moderated mediation model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between consumers' satisfaction with their health insurance and quality of life (QoL), the mediating role of perceived financial burden in this relationship, as well as the moderating effect of external locus of control (LoC) on the relationship between perceived financial burden and QoL among cancer patients. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional design was employed in order to collect quantitative data by means of a self-administrated questionnaire. Participants consisted of 387 conveniently selected consumers diagnosed with cancer in Iran. Furthermore, the questionnaire was translated into Persian using a forward-backward method. The model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings The results indicate that the more satisfied patients are with their health insurance, the higher QoL they experience, and this relationship is explained through reducing perceived financial burden in terms of direct and indirect costs of the disease. Although external LoC belief is negatively related to QoL, it buffers the negative association between financial burden and QoL. Practical implications Reducing the disparity between consumers' expectation and perception of the comprehensiveness of health insurance policies may relieve consumers' anxiety stemming from financial worries. Originality/value This paper fills a gap in the literature where consumers' perception about quality of insurance and its relationship with their QoL has received little attention so far.

TI  - Money Worries: Examining Demographic Difference in Financial Anxiety
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - We identify key demographic groups that suffer the most from financial anxiety. Identifying demographic groups that suffer the most from financial anxiety will aid in finding policy avenues to improve financial outcomes. With data from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study and Ordinary Least Square regressions, we find that females and those individuals with some college are the most financially anxious. In addition, the separated or divorced worry more than the married, those with children worry more than the childless, and White non-Hispanics worry more than other racial/ethnic groups. Analyses of gender subsamples show that black non-Hispanic males worry more than White non-Hispanic males, while the result of the female subsample is the opposite. The findings of this study have major policy implications, and more research is needed to determine how to best measure financial anxiety and solutions to reduce financial anxiety. Financial counseling and planning professionals can target groups that are most financially anxious. We recommend that financial education include a curriculum to educate and prepare individuals for financial anxiety and its implication on financial outcomes.

TI  - Do the effects of individual factors on financial risk-taking behavior diversify with financial literacy?
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to examine the roles of individual factors on risky investment intention as an indicator of risky financial behavior.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data were collected from a survey instrument and composed of 496 individuals' responses. The authors exploited structural equation modelling and multigroup structural equation modelling for direct and indirect effects, respectively.
   Findings - Results indicate that emotional intelligence and locus of control have a positive impact on financial risk-taking, while risk aversion in general has the negative one. Although financial literacy does not have a direct effect on risky financial behavior, it has important role as a moderator variable, interacting with external locus of control.
   Originality/value - The authors expect this study to contribute into behavioral finance literature in two ways. First, they investigate joint and relative effects of four major factors (i.e. emotional intelligence, locus of control, risk aversion in general and financial literacy) identified in the literature on financial risk-taking of individual investors. Each belongs to a different venue in an individual's psyche and therefore is expected to influence financial risk-taking through different mechanisms. However, the research arguing their roles on the financial risky behavior directly is very limited. Investigating their individual effects is likely to provide unique insights into our understanding of risky financial behavior. Second, the authors also posit and manifest that the effects of the first three of the aforementioned factors on risk-taking intentions are moderated by financial literacy. This finding is likely to provide rather valuable insights pertaining to the emergence of risk-taking behaviors and may shed light on the root reasons behind equivocal findings in previous research regarding the effect of each factor.

TI  - Love, Lies, and Money: Financial Infidelity in Romantic Relationships
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB  - Romantic relationships are built on trust, but partners are not always honest about their financial behavior-they may hide spending, debt, and savings from one another. This article introduces the construct of financial infidelity, defined as "engaging in any financial behavior expected to be disapproved of by one's romantic partner and intentionally failing to disclose this behavior to them." We develop and validate the Financial Infidelity Scale (FI-Scale) to measure individual variation in consumers' financial infidelity proneness. In 10 lab studies, one field study, and analyses of real bank account data collected in partnership with a couples' money-management mobile application, we demonstrate that the FI-Scale has strong psychometric properties, is distinct from conceptually related scales, and predicts actual financial infidelity among married consumers. Importantly, the FI-Scale predicts a broad range of consumption-related behaviors (e.g., spending despite anticipated spousal disapproval, preferences for discreet payment methods and unmarked packaging, concealing bank account information). Our work is the first to introduce, define, and measure financial infidelity reliably and succinctly and examine its antecedents and consequences.

TI  - Antecedents of the Youngster's Awareness About Financial Literacy: A Structure Equation Modelling Approach
T2  - VISION-THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
AB  - Financial literacy has been identified as an important functional area that attains a special concern in the Indian government policies and plans specially designed for the financial market. SEBI has issued various guidelines and awareness programs towards investment financial products, digital payment systems, consumer protection and so on. Therefore, the purpose of the present article is to analyze the level of financial literacy among youngsters in India. The study examined the relationship between the antecedents of financial literacy, that is, financial attitude, financial knowledge and financial behavior. The theoretical purposed model was tested with the help of primary data that was collected with the help of the self-structured questionnaire. A total of 647 responses were obtained from the respondents belonging to the holy city Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India. To identify the financial literacy antecedents and their inter-relationship, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling were applied to the collected data. The findings indicated that in the case of the Indian population, financial attitude and financial behavior were significantly associated with financial literacy. The moderation analysis reveals that males are more particular about financial knowledge and financial behavior in comparison to females. Respondents belonging to the age group of 26-30 years have better financial knowledge. Respondents who have income more than (sic)800 thousand and below two years have more financial knowledge. This article contributes to the theoretical body of knowledge by providing insights about the interesting topic of financial literacy by identifying its antecedents. The study also highlights the impact of the demographic variables as moderators on the antecedents of financial literacy. The outcomes of the study are vital for the government in the designing of public policies. The findings are helpful for the educational program designers for the outlining of the programs and syllabus for the subjects taught in the schools and colleges. The findings are useful for the bank managers to understand the psychological behavior as well as demographic variables for the effective marketing and communication of their financial products.

TI  - Green Credit Policy and asset-debt maturity mismatch in highly polluting enterprises: Evidence from China
T2  - ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND POLICY
AB  - China's Green Credit Policy (GCP) promotes environmentally sustainable practices, which are crucial for ecological responsibility. Despite its importance, the policy's impact on asset-debt maturity mismatches-a key determinant of financial stability-has not been systematically examined. This research scrutinizes the consequences of the Green Credit Guidelines on asset-debt maturity mismatches in China's heavily polluting enterprises, employing a differencein-differences (DID) methodology. An analysis of data from Chinese-listed companies from 2009 to 2017 reveals that the implementation of the guidelines has precipitated a marked shift towards short-term debt as a financing mechanism for long-term assets, particularly noticeable in state-owned and large-scale enterprises. The effects intensify in regions with stringent environmental regulations and companies possessing significant collateral. Moreover, the guidelines amplify financial constraints and decrease long-term debts, prompting firms to strategically embrace greater asset-debt maturity mismatches in response to more rigorous financial conditions. Our findings indicate that although the GCP is designed to promote eco-friendly practices, it inadvertently affects corporate financial decisions, underscoring the complex relationship between environmental policy and financial strategy. This study enhances the understanding of the financial repercussions of environmental policies on corporate actions, offering valuable perspectives to regulators and financial institutions.

TI  - Finnish perspectives on the business of electricity distribution
T2  - OXFORD OPEN ENERGY
AB  - The profits of the Finnish industry of electricity distribution are driven by a rate of return regulation model. Changes in the model caused a remarkable jump in distribution system operator (DSO) profits. The model rewards large costs and gives the DSOs an incentive to build an extremely weatherproof network, to overinvest. Allowed exceptions to lower costs of network construction may not be fully utilized. Risks connected to demographic changes may influence the forecasted network investment profitability. The emergence of energy communities may also affect the DSOs. There may be differences between public and private DSOs<acute accent> financial behavior. The ability of stakeholders to affect regulatory decisions is asymmetric.
   Graphical Abstract
   This paper discusses the Finnish electricity distribution business. The focus is on the Finnish regulation framework, especially the model used in the regulation of returns, the investments made to develop the electricity transfer network, and on the weatherproofing of the network. The investment strategies used in the industry and the ownership of the Finnish DSOs are discussed, and the future of the industry including the possible changes and risks facing the DSOs are explored.

TI  - Financial literacy of high school students in the Netherlands: knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION
AB  - We examined levels of financial literacy (knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and self-reported behavior) among 15-year-old high school students in the Netherlands (N= 2025), and investigated which factors are associated with the different financial literacy components. Our findings show lower levels of financial literacy among students in the lowest track in high school, students with low mathematical ability, immigrant students, students with low SES, students with mothers without a university degree, and students who do not discuss financial matters with family and peers. Notably, our findings show a large gap in financial knowledge levels between the lowest and highest high-school tracks in the Netherlands. These findings are useful for designing effective financial education and intervention programs, and for identifying groups that may benefit the most from financial education programs.

TI  - Do CEOs Who Are Raising Daughters Reduce Company Risk-taking?
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - Family structure and characteristics are important factors that affect both economic development and CEOs' decision-making. Corporate risk-taking reflects the overall risk choices and preferences of decision-makers in relation to various decisions. Using data for Chinese non-state-owned enterprises between the years 2000 and 2019, we examine the association between CEO offspring gender and corporate risk-taking. We find that CEOs who have daughters are associated with a lower level of corporate risk-taking than CEOs who have sons only. Raising daughters significantly stimulates cautious attitudes and behaviors in CEOs and reduces firm overinvestment, thereby lowering the level of corporate risk-taking. Moreover, raising daughters has a more significant inhibitory effect on corporate risk-taking for female CEOs and CEOs who were born in regions with a strong patriarchal culture. Our findings also show that CEOs with daughters can help companies effectively avoid financial crises. Focusing on both parenting behavior and corporate financial behavior, we suggest that the parent-child relationship extends far beyond the scope of the family, providing a broader perspective for understanding corporate decision-making and financial behavior.

TI  - Determinents of Financial Behaviour of Individual Investors: In Context with Financial Literacy, Overconfidence and Herding
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Purpose: Financial decisions largely depend upon Financial Literacy and psychological biases of an individual investor. Drawing upon the behavioural finance theory, this paper articulates the association of Financial Literacy, overconfidence and herding bias of individual investors with their financial behaviour.
   Methodology: The survey method was employed to collect data from 171 salaried individuals, who are living in Delhi, India and investing through Angle Broking Co. (Securities co.). Online structured questionnaires were circulated by using a purposive sampling method to collect the responses. To examine the strength of the relationship between variables, partial correlation and hierarchical regression tests were applied using SPSS software.
   Findings: The findings revealed that only investor's Financial Literacy have a strong positive association with their financial behavior whereas overconfidence and herding bias have negative impact.
   Practical Implications: The findings of this study may serve as a guide to policymakers and the management of financial institutions in developing investment policies as per the financial behavior of individuals.
   Originality/Value: This article in useful for the policy makers, insurance companies and Government agencies should focus on conducting financial education programs for the purpose of increasing financial awareness among individuals.

TI  - Decomposition of the Financial Capability Construct: A Structural Model of Debt Knowledge, Skills, Confidence, Attitudes, and Behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - Based on a nationally representative sample of adult Poles (N = 1,004), we examined structural relationships between financial knowledge, skills, confidence, attitudes, and behavior in debt-domain. We found that financial confidence-at least regarding debt-related issues-is tied to debt attitudes and behavior beyond the extent to which the attitudes and behaviors are linked to objective debt knowledge. Moreover, the relationship between objective knowledge and confidence turned out to be insignificant in our study. These findings suggest that confidence should be used as a separate marker of financial capability. Having established that skills correlate with behavior and attitudes differently than objective knowledge, we argue also to include them separately in financial capability measurements.

TI  - Understanding financial professionals' perceptions of their clients' financial behaviors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThis article describes financial professionals' perceptions of their clients' financial behaviors and the explanatory factors underlying these behaviors.Design/methodology/approachIn this qualitative research, the authors seek to understand financial professionals' experiences in relation to how their clients manage their own finances. The authorse conduct and analyze 26 semi-structured interviews with financial professionals from several industries within the financial sector in Canada.FindingsThe professionals in this study noted that despite their clients' financial knowledge, several other factors can explain these individuals' financial behaviors. They include psychological factors, (such as financial bias, the need for instant gratification, and the lack of awareness regarding the long-term effects of certain types of financial behaviors), financial habits (such as lifestyle, financial planning and lack of discipline) and the financial system's flexibility with respect to debt financing and repayment. These perceptions are categorized according to whether they are related to debt financing or repayment, savings or investments.Originality/valueBy using a qualitative methodology that relies on the perceptions of financial professionals, this study aims to better understand the financial behaviors of individuals and households, and these behaviors' underlying factors. This study's findings could be useful to various stakeholders interested, in one way or another, in financial literacy, such as organizations aiming to strengthen and promote financial literacy, educators, researchers, regulatory bodies of financial institutions and financial advisers.

TI  - SaveWise: The impact of a real-life financial education program for ninth grade students in the Netherlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - This experimental study with a pre-post and follow-up design evaluates the financial education program "SaveWise"for ninth grade students in the Netherlands (n = 713). SaveWise adopts a holistic approach, emphasizing action rather than mere cognition. Benefitting from explicit instruction embedded in real-life contexts, students in the program set a personal savings goal and are coached on how to achieve it. The short-term treatment results indicated that SaveWise expanded the students' level of financial knowledge; encouraged their intentions to save more, spend less and earn an income; and broadly improved their financial and savings behavior. The program demonstrated that it could serve as an effective and low-cost method to enhance the financial literacy of prevocational students, a financially vulnerable group. Although long-term effects were expressed only through financial socialization, this study offers evidence linking curricula to increased knowledge and improved behavior for a specific sample of students.

TI  - The Effect of the Subjective Holocaust Influence Level on Holocaust Survivors' Offspring
T2  - JOURNAL OF LOSS & TRAUMA
AB  - This paper examines how is the Subjective Holocaust Influence Level (SHIL) of Holocaust survivors' offspring (HSO) is reflected in their daily life, habits and wellbeing. For this purpose, we asked 346 Jewish-Israeli HSO about their daily life, habits and emotions and divided them into three groups based on their SHIL. We find that higher SHIL correlated with increased worry, being more suspicious of others, higher anxiety about the future, feeling a need to survive, risk aversion, self-rated health and unwillingness to discard food. However, we found only a minor effect on their financial behavior.

TI  - An Exploration of Overconfidence and the Disposition Effect in the Stock Market
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - This paper offers a comprehensive empirical overview of the impact of overconfidence in the stock market, thus contributing to the existing research literature on this topic. The study employs a bibliometric approach that utilizes the VOSviewer to extract and analyze 277 articles registered between 1992 and January 2023. By providing a detailed analysis of the literature, this research expands our understanding of the impact of overconfidence in the stock market and offers avenues for future studies in this area. The results of this analysis are noteworthy, as they reveal several important findings. These include the exponential growth of scientific production in recent decades, the concentration of research in specific journals indexed in the Journal Citation Reports, the presence of institutional co-author networks, and the thematic and temporal segregation of financial behavior concepts. The most significant finding of this study is the identification of six major clusters: investor behavior during times of crisis; behavioral finance; herding and risk-taking concepts; psychological and cognitive decisions; emotions and decision-making; and the performance of stocks. This temporal evolution of research demonstrates the emergence of various perspectives on the relationship between individual financial behavior and the global market. This study represents a pioneering effort in the field of bibliometric analysis as it is the first to specifically examine the subject of overconfidence in the stock market using this method.

TI  - Financial Literacy Externalities
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - We use unique administrative data and a quasi-field experiment of exogenous allocation in Sweden to estimate medium- and longer-run effects of peoples' exposure to financially literate neighbors on their financial behavior. We contribute evidence of (1) a causal impact of exposure and of a social multiplier of financial knowledge and (2) unfavorable distributional aspects of externalities. Exposure promotes saving in private retirement accounts and stockholding, especially when neighbors have economics or business education, but only for educated households and for substantial interaction possibilities. Findings point to a transfer of knowledge rather than mere imitation or effects through labor, education, or mobility channels.

TI  - The Fetal Origins Hypothesis in Finance: Prenatal Environment, the Gender Gap, and Investor Behavior
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - We find that differences in individuals' prenatal environments explain heterogeneity in financial decisions later in life. An exogenous increase in exposure to prenatal testosterone is associated with the masculinization of financial behavior, specifically with elevated risk taking and trading in adulthood. We also examine birth weight. Those with higher birth weight are more likely to participate in the stock market, whereas those with lower birth weight tend to prefer portfolios with higher volatility and skewness, consistent with compensatory behavior. Our results contribute to the understanding of how the prenatal environment shapes an individual's behavior in financial markets later in life.

TI  - Consuming Dividends
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - This paper studies why investors buy dividend-paying assets and how they time consumption accordingly. We combine administrative bank data linking customers' consumption and income to portfolio data and survey responses on financial behavior. We find that private consumption is excessively sensitive to dividend income. Investors across wealth, income, and age distributions increase spending precisely around days of dividend receipt. Our results are at odds with a number of existing rational and behavioral explanations, such as financial constraints and impulsiveness. Instead, consumption responses reflect "planned" excess sensitivity, driven by investors who select dividend portfolios, anticipate dividend income, and plan consumption accordingly.

TI  - The Cost-Benefit of Aging: Financial Capability and Well-Being across Age Groups in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGING RESEARCH
AB  - A large proportion of older persons in developing countries do not have access to pension, which also constrains their ability to afford healthcare services and entails extensive challenges to the well-being of older people. This study aimed to analyze the financial preparedness of different age groups for retirement in Brazil. Data were derived from a survey to empirically validate the proposed relationships between preparedness for retirement and resilience for the future (financial well-being (FWB) outcomes) on the one hand and among demographic and socioeconomic aspects, behaviors and attitudes, knowledge and experience, and "key" psychological factors on the other hand. The sample consisted of 412 individuals aged between 22 and 79 years. FWB was measured using the financial capability and well-being model and regressed on a number of sociodemographic and psychological variables using linear regression analyses. The results demonstrated that preparedness for retirement was strongly related to older age. Additionally, age was correlated with resilience for the future close to zero, which indicates no relationship. Knowledge and the psychological factors of self-control and confidence were positively and strongly related to better financial behavior for all age groups. In addition, grit and resilience for the future were positively related to better financial behavior in the older age group. Furthermore, the variables of retirement contribution were seemingly not viewed as important to the older group compared with their young and mature counterparts. Multidimensional interventions, especially targeting behaviors and psychological patterns, could, therefore, be recommended in advance to young and mature groups to prepare them to secure their old age and achieve FWB.

TI  - Examining the Impact of Financial Literacy, Financial Self-Control, and Demographic Determinants on Individual Financial Performance and Behavior: An Insight from the Lebanese Crisis Period
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study investigated the effects of financial literacy, financial self-control, and demographic determinants on individual financial performance and behavior during the Lebanese crisis period between 2019 and 2021. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first study that compares the determinants of financial behavior for different generations, genders, marital statuses, and education and income levels. To do so, we conducted a comprehensive survey of 328 individuals and performed a logistic regression analysis. The empirical results show that an individual's financial performance and behavior are positively affected by financial literacy, financial self-control, and demographic factors, in particular education and income levels. In addition, when we focused on the demographic factors, the results reveal that having good financial literacy increases the likelihood of an individual's financial performance and behavior, in particular for Generations X and Z, males and females, single and married people, low- and high-educated people, and low- and high-income individuals. However, having good financial self-control only increases the likelihood of an individual's financial performance and behavior at highly educated levels. The results are robust and come from various performed methodologies, and the results have important policy implications. The policies should be focused on enhancing an individual's financial behavior and helping young adults acquire skills in self-control. Policies could also motivate local financial institutions to offer a variety of financial products and investment opportunities, targeting low-income and low-educated individuals, by providing subsidized funds with parallel mandatory financial studies.

TI  - Field of Study and Financial Problems: How Economics Reduces the Risk of Default
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - This paper documents how extensive economic education can reduce the risk of getting into financial trouble by comparing people who enter business and economics programs with people who enter other higher education programs. To identify the causal effect, I exploit GPA admission thresholds that quasi-randomize applicants near the thresholds into different higher education programs. I find that admission to an economics program reduces the probability of loan default and delinquency by one half. This large reduction is associated with changes in financial behavior, but it is not associated with differences in the level or stability of people's income. Authors have furnished an , which is available on the Oxford University Press Web site next to the link to the final published paper online.

TI  - Experience and Firms' Financing Behavior: A Behavioral Perspective
T2  - GERMAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Using multinomial logit methodology for financing application decisions for bank loans, credit lines and trade credits, we show that firms' financial behavior is driven by their lagged experience. Moreover, the optimism and pessimism of firms (animal spirit) is another important determinant. Our results stress the importance of the behavioral perspective to corporate finance. The policy of quantitative easing of the ECB had only weak effects on the access to banking loans, while it was significantly correlated with lower internal funding. Our results have possible implications to understand the behavioral dynamics of corporate financing structure the in the post pandemic period.

TI  - Financing and supervisory effects of credit ratings: evidence from mergers and acquisitions
T2  - NANKAI BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how credit ratings affect corporate financial behavior from the perspective of merger and acquisition (M&A) decisions. The goal is to test the financing and supervisory effects of credit ratings and study the economic consequences of credit ratings in the context of China. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of Chinese A-share listed companies over the 2008-2017 period, this paper empirically examines the effect of credit ratings on firms' M&A decisions. The authors used a probit model for regression when they tested the effect of credit rating on M&A likelihood and a tobit model when they tested the effect of credit rating on M&A intensity. Findings First, rated enterprises tend to make more acquisitions compared with non-rated enterprises, consistent with the hypothesis that credit ratings alleviate financing constraints. Second, high-rated enterprises are more cautious toward M&As due to concerns about preserving their ratings, which indicates that credit ratings also play a supervisory role in the M&A process. Additional tests show that enterprises reduce M&A activity after a rating downgrade to avoid further deterioration in their ratings; this further supports the supervisory role of credit ratings. Originality/value This paper adds incremental evidence to the literature on the impact of credit ratings on corporate financial behavior and extends the literature on the factors influencing M&As. The authors provided empirical evidence from emerging capital markets for the financing and supervisory effects of credit ratings and provided theoretical guidance for promoting the stable, long-term development of China's credit rating industry.

TI  - The Financial Decisions of Immigrant and Native Households: Evidence from Italy
T2  - ITALIAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB  - Using rich Italian data for the period 2006-2014, we analyze differences in financial behavior between natives and immigrants in a unified setting covering a wide set of outcomes and including a large set of covariates. We document sizeable gaps between native and immigrant households with respect to wealth holdings and financial decisions. Immigrant household heads hold less net wealth than native along the entire wealth distribution. Immigrant status reduces the likelihood of holding risky assets, housing, mortgages, businesses, and valuables, and it increases the likelihood of financial fragility. Standard regression results are corroborated by a propensity score matching strategy. Years since migration, country of origin, and the pattern of intermarriage also matter. The Great Recession has worsened the condition of immigrants in terms of wealth holdings, home ownership, and financial fragility.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This study explores the nexus between digital financial inclusion and household participation in commercial insurance, utilizing data from the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index and the 2018 CFPS database. Using Probit and Logit models, our research uncovers significant regional and risk -preference variations, emphasizing the influence of governance mechanisms. The study underscores the pivotal role of digital participation in a sustainable governance mechanism in shaping financial behavior, as well as the importance of advocating for regulatory interventions, enhanced financial literacy, and infrastructure development to foster equitable insurance access. Moreover, positive determinants, such as education level and social insurance participation, are identified, while discretionary spending emerges as a barrier. This study advocates for expedited digital financial inclusion initiatives to increase financial literacy with strengthened regulatory oversight and governance mechanisms which would ensure sustainable regional development and insurance market resilience.

TI  - Financial decisions of minorities post-2008
T2  - JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE
AB  - We study the financial behavior of minorities over 2007-09. We find that after 2008 and compared to White Americans, African Americans and Hispanics have a higher propensity to increase risk tolerance, optimism, and allocations to risky assets and lower probability of exiting the stock market. These findings cannot be explained by changes in wealth or income, and we speculate that they may be due to the positive effects of the election of President Obama. Specifically, we find that the change in behavior by minorities from 2007 to 2009 is consistent with minorities updating their beliefs about future economic outcomes.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper examines the relation between the level of trust in a country and the cost of debt. Using data on firms located in 22 countries over a 20-year period, we quantify the country trust level and find strong evidence that firms in countries with a higher level of societal trust have lower bond yield spreads. We also find that the impact of trust on the cost of debt is more pronounced in countries with a poor governance environment and during a time of financial crisis. Overall, our results highlight the role of social capital in shaping corporate financial behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Digital real estate in the metaverse: An empirical analysis of retail investor motivations
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - This paper investigates retail investor motivations for digital real estate ownership in the cryptometaverse. Utilizing a detailed financial behavior survey of metaverse landowners' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, we apply principal components analysis to uncover four distinct motivational groups: (1) Aesthetics and Identity, (2) Social and Community, (3) Speculation and Investment, and (4) Innovation and Technology. Our findings reveal that age, education, investment knowledge, risk-taking, and impulsivity significantly influence investor group membership. This research provides valuable insights to investors and developers, underscoring the potential of a platform to attract retail investors with speculative intentions, engagement longevity, and passive or active trading characteristics, contingent on unique crypto-metaverse attributes.

TI  - Mitigating Financial Investment Polarization: The Role of Digital Payments in Enhancing Household Participation
T2  - EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
AB  - This study examines the impact of digital payments on household financial asset investment, using the China Household Finance Survey (2013-2019). Our findings indicate that digital payments positively affect financial market participation and investment size, reshaping asset allocation structures. While households using digital payments show increased participation and investment amounts across various financial assets, a reduction in the weight of deposits is evident. The study highlights two key channels through which digital payments influence financial behavior: enhancing subjective financial literacy and increasing households' attention to financial information. The research emphasizes the role of digital payments in mitigating polarization effects in household financial asset allocation.

TI  - The long-run poverty and gender impacts of mobile money
T2  - SCIENCE
AB  - Mobile money, a service that allows monetary value to be stored on a mobile phone and sent to other users via text messages, has been adopted by the vast majority of Kenyan households. We estimate that access to the Kenyan mobile money system M-PESA increased per capita consumption levels and lifted 194,000 households, or 2% of Kenyan households, out of poverty. The impacts, which are more pronounced for female-headed households, appear to be driven by changes in financial behavior-in particular, increased financial resilience and saving-and labor market outcomes, such as occupational choice, especially for women, who moved out of agriculture and into business. Mobile money has therefore increased the efficiency of the allocation of consumption over time while allowing a more efficient allocation of labor, resulting in a meaningful reduction of poverty in Kenya.

AB  - Household income, assets, and socioeconomic context influence people's financial behavior and their financial literacy. This study uses a mixed methods financial diaries to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the finances of 28 Canadians with low income. Contrary to results from national surveys on financial literacy, we found that these low- and modest- to middle-income participants were careful with their finances by doing things such as paying of one's credit card immediately, deliberately focusing on needs, and tracking one's finances. There were cases of decisions that seemed to harm the participants longer-term financial wellbeing but, in many cases, barriers in banking, the labor market, and government support programs prevented a better choice.

AB  - This study explores and analyses the implications of digital financial services (DFS) on human development from a global perspective. Informed by a systematic literature review of studies published in the past two decades, from 2000 to 2020, this research unveils six overarching themes: contextual conditions, technological skills and financial literacy, consistent trust, shaping financial behavior, energizing economic activities, and supporting financial inclusion. Further analysis categorizes these themes into what constitutes the two intertwined dimensions of DFS: foundational conditions and effectual repercussions. We discuss how these dimensions enhance our understanding of the role information and communication technologies play in contributing to human development. We also present practical implications for different stakeholders in the financial sector.

TI  - Local versus national banking development in Europe: who is the winner?
T2  - EURASIAN BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - This article investigates the role of local banking development, per se, in European SME debt policies, using a cross-country dataset. Moreover, it assesses whether the debt policies of SMEs are mainly driven by local or national banking development. We find that higher levels of local banking development increase the amount of debt used by SMEs. Results suggest that national banking institutions reduce the influence of local banking sectors on SME financial behavior. Several robustness and further tests validate our results, suggesting that whilst the process of international integration and digitalization of financial markets, local banking development is still relevant despite the moderating role of national banking policies. Consequently, policy makers should first and foremost allow headquarters and central banks to better support local banks in integrating national banking policies in order to reduce the financial constraints on SMEs and spur their economic growth.

TI  - Two Aspects of Digitalization Affecting Financial Asset Allocation: Evidence from China
T2  - EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
AB  - The digital economy has a significant influence on the financial behavior of enterprises. According to the panel data of A-share listed enterprises in the manufacturing industry from 2010 to 2020, we discuss how manufacturing enterprises allocate their financial assets in the process of digitalization from the perspective of operating profit and risk taking. The results reveal that ICT investment significantly reduces financial asset allocation, while digital transformation improves the financial asset allocation of manufacturing enterprises. Because ICT investment increases operating profit from the main business, manufacturing enterprises reduce the allocation of short-term and long-term financial assets. We thus propose two phenomena: precautionary saving and substitutional investment. As digital transformation increases risk taking, financial assets are elevated by manufacturing enterprises for the precautionary saving motivation, boosting the short-term financial assets in their portfolios. These findings are further supported by the heterogeneity of innovation characteristics and ownership.

T2  - UCJC BUSINESS AND SOCIETY REVIEW
AB  - Moving towards the Sustainable Development Goals set by the UN for 2030 and the subsequent transition to a green and circular economy necessarily require a transformation of the financial sector and, specifically, the development of financial products that promote the channeling of money towards companies and projects with social and environmental benefits. This research aims to identify the level of knowledge and beliefs about this type of products, as well as estimate the intention of clients to invest in ethical banking and socially responsible financial products.
   The results reveal that knowledge is scarce and that information campaigns must modify the image that customers currently have of these products in relation to their financial behavior and their ability to solve social and environmental problems.

TI  - Shaping crowdlending investors' trust: Technological, social, and economic exchange perspectives
T2  - ELECTRONIC MARKETS
AB  - The rise of crowdlending enables small firms to borrow capital where transaction costs are reduced and financial accessibility is improved. Crowdlending platforms require lenders to depend solely on the information provided by its borrowers. Such information reliance could impact lenders' financial behavior and investment decision and return. In this study, we develop a model to understand what elements and factors influence the formation of trust in crowdlending. Our results suggest that lenders are likely to pay more attention to platform quality and risk mitigation strategy than attractive loan cues. Our findings can aid the crowdlending industry in growing its investor base and increasing potential customers' access to capital. These findings could also assist in developing regulatory guidelines in the crowdlending market.

TI  - How emotions influence behavior in financial markets: a conceptual analysis and emotion-based account of buy-sell preferences
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - We develop a conceptual analysis and account of how emotions influence behavior in financial markets. To motivate our approach and to establish the need for such research, we first review the increasingly important literature on emotions in financial markets. While emotions influence investors in financial markets, there is a lack of precision concerning the exact nature of these influences. To remedy this, we identify and address a number of issues deriving from the current state of the finance literature. One issue concerns the lack of clarity in defining different emotion constructs. Another is the lack of a general emotion-based account of financial behavior. Our contribution is a classification of emotion-related phenomena and an emotion-based account of how anticipatory and anticipated emotions interact to determine investors' buy and sell preferences in asset markets. Preliminary experimental results support our emotion-based account.

AB  - This study aims to propose and validate a financial literacy perception scale for the Portuguese population. The utilized methodology was quantitative, based on a two-part questionnaire survey. The first part studies the sociodemographic profile and the second part evaluates the respondent's perception of financial literacy. The sample consisted of 830 Portuguese individuals, over 18 years old. The main results of this study demonstrate that the financial literacy perception scale presents a tri-factorial structure with satisfactory validity and reliability levels. The three obtained factors are 1-2 years financial planning and goals, long term savings and an affinity for numerical calculation. This study contributes to the increase of scientific knowledge in the field of financial literacy, to the assistance of financial education policymakers in the reformulation of their policies and to the creation of tools to help consumer financial behavior.

TI  - Do Lenders Applaud Corporate Environmental Performance? Evidence from Chinese Private-Owned Firms
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB  - This study extends previous literature on the association between corporate social responsibility and corporate financial behavior by investigating the influence of corporate environmental performance on the cost of debt. Using a sample of Chinese private-owned firms, we document strong and consistent evidence to show that corporate environmental performance is significantly negatively associated with the interest rate on debt-the proxy for the cost of debt. The findings suggest that lenders applaud better environmental performance. Moreover, internal control attenuates the negative association between corporate environmental performance and the interest rate on debt, implying substitutive effects between corporate environmental performance and internal control on the reduction of interest rates on debt. The results are robust to various sensitivity tests and are still valid after controlling for the potential endogeneity between corporate environmental performance and the interest rate on debt.

TI  - BANKING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALIZATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (EVIDENCE FROM AZERBAIJAN AND UKRAINE)
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the banking business' internationalization impact on financial markets, which is especially implemented in developing countries, primarily in post-communist states. The reasons for foreign banks to conquer new markets in this region have been the subject of numerous studies. The article's novelty is the comparative analysis of the banking systems' internationalization in Azerbaijan and Ukraine, through both theoretical and econometric aspects. As a result of existing concepts of banking internationalization's generalization, three generic features were identified: economies of scale, competitive advantage over local banks, customers' financial behavior; based on this, the systematics for theoretical support of this process is proposed.
   Based on the comparison of foreign-owned banks share in developed and emerging countries, it is concluded a presence of the fundamental international banking business' expansion in developing countries on the eve of the global financial crisis, which served as an aggravating circumstance in the spread of negative consequences.
   The level of deposits dollarization and foreign exchange Loans-to-Deposits Ratio proves the key role of international banks in provoking currency credit expansion in both countries; in Ukraine this expansion (due to central bank's irrational actions in foreign exchange regulation) has grown into a credit boom, which especially negatively affected the global financial crisis flow in the state.
   For empirical confirmation of these assumptions, the economic analysis of banking systems internationalization and development indicators in Azerbaijan and Ukraine was realized through VAR-modeling. The key factors were: cross-border net position of international banks for residents of these countries, system's capitalization, Loans-to-Deposits Ratio, share of deposits in bank passives and the actual banking multiplier. The analysis substantiates the significant impact of international banking business on the state of the banking systems, the degree of which depends on the type of trade policy.

AB  - This study examines the effects of religiosity and Islamic financial literacy on Muslims' financial behavior and well-being. Additionally, it investigates the impact of sociodemographic variables on the centrality of religiosity, financial literacy, financial management behavior, and the well-being of Muslim consumers. This research integrates perspectives from Rational Choice Theory, the Rational Choice Theory of Religion, and Behavioral Finance to illuminate the mechanisms behind these relationships. Data were collected through a non-probability sampling method from 1141 Muslim individuals aged between 18 and 65 living in Indonesia. The results indicate that the centrality of religion in the lives of Muslim consumers and Islamic financial literacy significantly affects their financial management behavior and financial well-being. However, the empirical evidence suggests a more substantial effect of Islamic financial literacy than religiosity on both dependent variables.

TI  - Consumer Finance Scales: Comparing English and Spanish Versions of a National Survey in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - Financial scales were developed to understand and explain the financial behavior of adults in the United States The main difference between them is that the Spanish-Language Supplement was composed only of Hispanics who prefer Spanish as their first language. Researchers combined various related questions using factor analysis (principal component analysis) to create the scales for financial anxiety, financial capability, financial readiness, financial self-efficacy, and financial technology. These scales and their corresponding scores allowed researchers to better measure specific concepts related to consumer financial management. Cronbach's alpha showed scales were reliable and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index confirmed the appropriateness of factor analyses. Except for financial capability, all financial scales using the 2018 NFCS State-by-State Survey were validated using the 2018 NFCS Spanish Supplement.

TI  - Blockholder leverage and payout policy: Evidence from French holding companies
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS FINANCE & ACCOUNTING
AB  - This paper focuses on dominant owners' use of leverage to finance their blockholdings and its relationship to dividend policy. We postulate that blockholder leverage may impact payout policy, in particular when earnings are hit by a negative shock. We use panel data for France where blockholders have tax incentives to structure their leverage in pyramidal holding companies and study the effect of the financial crisis in 2008/2009. We find no difference in payout policy and financial behavior during the 1999 to 2008 period between firms with levered owners and other firms. However, in the years 2009 to 2011 following the crisis, dividend payouts increase in proportion to pyramidal debt of dominant owners. We inspect pyramidal entities individually and find that on average only 60% of dividends are passed through to the ultimate owners, with the rest predominantly used to meet debt service obligations of the pyramidal entities.

TI  - The Limits of the "Progressive" Institutional Change: Migration and Remittances Experiences
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - The financial and business expansion towards both sides of the Mexico-U.S. border, what could be called the financial diaspora that accompanies Mexican ' s migration to the United States and U.S. Corporations to Mexico, has been a process full of nuances and components with different characteristics. Beyond the governments and their migratory and investment policies, the characteristics of the different migrant groups and corporations, the cultural gaps, and the "progressive" institutional changes are subject to a dynamic of survival-assimilation-earnings. Even when powerful trials of organization are observed, a strong and imminent current of regressive institutional change (Veblen) has been gaining space. This article is circumscribed to analyze some key aspects of the financial behavior Mexican migrants to the United States, who have become entrepreneurs, have had. Their enormous limitations of financing are exposed, including the different stages to access credit to the businesses of residents in Mexico and to Mexican businesspeople abroad. The article contends the transformation in financing on both sides of the border has been decisive.

TI  - An Assessment Tool to Identify the Financial Literacy Level of Financial Education Programs Participants' Executed by Ecuadorian Financial Institutions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Due to the lack of a tool assessing the effectiveness of Financial Education Programs (FEP) imparted by the financial institutions (FI) in Ecuador by mandate, this research proposes and validates a scale to evaluate the Financial Literacy (FL) level of 314 participants (15-50 years old) after attending an FEP. The final 18-item FL scale, compounded with Financial Attitude, Financial Knowledge, and Financial Behavior dimensions, is reliable and robust according to the Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The average score for FL is 76 out of 100 points. The youngest scored the lowest, and the FI employees the highest. This contribution fulfills a needed FL scale to accurately measure the efforts of FI spreading the FE. It serves as a stepping stone for further research reconfirming its validity and applying the proposed FI's FL scale as a pre-post FL evaluation.

TI  - Financial literacy in Tunisia: Its determinants and its implications on investment behavior
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Given the dynamic changes in the economic environment, especially in financial markets, a need is felt to improve investors' financial knowledge. Financial literacy entails informed financial decisions. The present study investigates the determinants of financial literacy and its impact on investment behavior. A questionnaire has been developed to elicit the study's variables and it is divided into three parts. The first part covers the demographic variables; the second deals with the financial behavior of the Tunisian households, and the third part is devoted to financial literacy.
   The study's findings are two fold: First, individuals with a low level of financial literacy are less likely to invest in the stock market. Second, the financial literacy level is found to be affected by age, education level, and the annual income. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identifying Hidden Factors Associated with Household Emergency Fund Holdings: A Machine Learning Application
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - This paper describes the results from a study designed to illustrate the use of machine learning analytical techniques from a household consumer perspective. The outcome of interest in this study is a household's degree of financial preparedness as indicated by the presence of an emergency fund. In this study, six machine learning algorithms were evaluated and then compared to predictions made using a conventional regression technique. The selected ML algorithms showed better prediction performance. Among the six ML algorithms, Gradient Boosting, kNN, and SVM were found to provide the most robust degree of prediction and classification. This paper contributes to the methodological literature in consumer studies as it relates to household financial behavior by showing that when prediction is the main purpose of a study, machine learning techniques provide detailed yet nuanced insights into behavior beyond traditional analytic methods.

TI  - Does Consumer Confidence Forecast Household Saving and Borrowing Behavior? Evidence for Poland
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - Consumer confidence plays an important role in households' decision-making processes. This study investigates the effects of consumer confidence on household saving and borrowing behavior that are unsatisfactorily considered in previous discussions. The questions of interest are first, whether indexes of consumer confidence have any predictive power on their own for future household saving and borrowing rates, and second, whether they contain information about future household saving and borrowing rates aside from the information contained in other available indicators. In addition to aggregate confidence indicators, their components are used to provide more precise information. Overall, the multiple linear regression analysis (OLS technique) of Polish time-series data gives positive answers to both questions. This finding supports the recommendation of combining the strengths of objective indicators (such as economic fundamentals) and subjective indicators (such as consumer confidence) to improve household financial behavior forecasts.

TI  - Investor preferences, financial literacy and intermediary choice towards sustainability
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Based on a large and representative sample of Italian adults, our study aims to detect the determinants of retail investor preferences for socially responsible (SR) financial intermediaries, i.e., intermediaries adopting environmental, social and governance strategies and offering both traditional and SR financial products. We demonstrate that SR financial intermediaries are chosen by individuals characterized by high self-reported orientation towards SR investments and high financial literacy. Disaggregating financial literacy into its three determinants, we show that the higher the financial knowledge and the more correct financial behavior of retail investors related to savings and financial control, the higher their preference for SR financial intermediaries. On the other hand, individual financial attitude towards savings and spending displays a negative relationship with this preference. Moreover, retail investors with more specific knowledge about portfolio diversification choose more SR financial intermediaries than other people.

TI  - The causal mechanism of financial education: Evidence from mediation analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - This paper uses a field experiment in India and mediation analysis to investigate the causal mechanisms between financial education and financial behavior. Focusing on the mediating role of financial literacy, we propose a broader definition of financial knowledge that includes three dimensions: numeracy skills, financial awareness, and attitudes towards personal finance. We then employ causal mediation analysis to investigate the proportion of the treatment effect that can be attributed to these three channels. Strikingly, we find that numeracy does not mediate any effects of financial education on financial outcomes. For simple financial actions such as budgeting, both awareness and attitudes serve as pathways, while for more complex financial activities such as opening a savings account, attitudes play a more prominent role-though these patterns appear to be sensitive to confounding. We also compare our mediation analysis results to other empirical techniques that have been typically used to study mechanisms, and we discuss how mediation analysis differs from these approaches.

TI  - How Behavioral Aspects Influence the Sustainable Financial Decisions of Shareholders: An Empirical Study and Proposal for a Relevant Decision-Making Concept
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Behavioral finance is an area or sub-discipline of behavioral economics that examines the real financial behavior and decision-making of people, including the knowledge of psychology and sociology. The objective of this paper was to identify and investigate the impact of significant cognitive, psychological and emotional factors affecting the financial decision-making of the shareholders of woodworking and furniture manufacturing and trading enterprises. This could lead to the design of decision-making concepts which take into account not only cognitive but also psychological and emotional factors and their influences on decision-making process, which could positively affect the sustainable development of the aforementioned types of enterprises. The mapping of the addressed issue was carried out by means of an empirical survey in the practice of the Slovak woodworking and furniture manufacturing and trading enterprises in the form of a questionnaire. The results of the survey were evaluated by descriptive, graphical and mathematical-statistical methods. Conclusions and recommendations were formulated based on the identification of key behavioral aspects (knowledge, security, freedom and sadness), the implementation of which could contribute to eliminating negative deviations and errors in the financial decision-making process of shareholders of woodworking and furniture manufacturing and trading enterprises.

TI  - A lack of financial planning predicts increased mortality risk: Evidence from cohort studies in the United Kingdom and United States
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - We investigate whether a lack of planning and future-orientation in financial behavior is associated with a higher mortality risk. Our evidence is based on two nationally representative cohorts of older people living in the United States (n = 11,478) and England (n = 11,298), where we compared individuals' self-reported planning horizons on spending and saving with government mortality records. Controlling for demographics, participants with a 1 SD shorter planning horizon had a 9% greater hazard of dying in the English sample (evaluated over 10 years), and a 7% greater hazard in the US sample (over 22 years). These differences in mortality risk could not be explained by variation in respondent's life expectancy, their financial circumstances or a range of other observable covariates. Similar results are found for self-reported health, with the positive association between longer planning horizons and health strongest for those with fewest financial resources.

TI  - Financial literacy and retirement planning in Ghana
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to investigate the impact of financial literacy on savings and retirement planning in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach The study uses primary data collected from a sample of formal sector workers and probit models, to assess how financial literacy affects retirement planning. Findings The empirical analysis of this study shows that most individuals lack knowledge of basic concepts of finance. This study finds that only about 27% of respondents were able to correctly answer three simple questions on inflation, interest compounding and risk diversification. Generally, the young, the old, women, low-income earners and the less educated perform worst on financial literacy measures. Also, financial literacy has a positive significant impact on the probability of saving for retirement. Practical implications The low level of financial literacy observed should be of concern to policymakers. Evidently, concrete measures are required to strengthen the knowledge of particularly those in the vulnerable groups such as the young, the old, women, low-income earners and the less educated, in order to enable them to prepare adequately for retirement. Originality/value The study contributes to the scant financial literacy and financial behavior literature in developing countries such as Ghana.

TI  - THE FINANCING BEHAVIOR OF AIRLINE COMPANIES
T2  - ANDULI
AB  - Airline companies, including many legacy airlines, have developed global alliances to adapt to dynamic competitive conditions to gain a competitive advantage over other companies. In this way, the number of destinations and network structures of the airline companies have expanded. This study examines the financial factors affecting the capital structure of airline companies that are members of global alliances. In this context, the goal of this study is to reveal the financing behaviors of airlines using theories related to the structure of capital. To this end, we used secondary financial data of member airlines in strategic alliances. For the scope of the study, the period of 2005-2017 was examined, and the panel data analysis method was used. Empirical results of the study indicate that: a) There are significant differences between short-term and long-term debt behaviors of the airlines that were analyzed, b) While long-term debt behavior of airlines is in accordance with the Trade-Off Theory, short-term debt behavior is in accordance with the Pecking Order Theory, and c) In the global alliances, the long-term financial behavior is similar to the traditional low-cost business model of airlines.

TI  - Does Gender Influence Investment Choice? A Psychosomatic Study of GCC Entrepreneurs
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - Entrepreneurs with behavioral finance biases are more likely to make irrational or financially detrimental decisions. Understanding financial behavior biases can assist in making sound financial decisions. Behavioral finance is a new topic that can assist researchers in better understanding investor behavior and preferences while purchasing and selling stocks. Using measures such as independent t-tests and average Likert five-point scale scores, this study seeks to determine how entrepreneurs make investment decisions and whether gender makes a difference. The study is empirical, and data from 1000 entrepreneurs were collected through convenience sampling. The study's main findings show that there are numerous factors to consider while investing in stocks, including family planning, children's education, investment security, and recurring income. Both men and women attempt to invest in many asset classes, but certain investments are extremely risky, while others are low risk. As a result, investors should assess risk based on their age and experience rather than their gender, this indicates that an investment in venture capital has nothing to do with gender but everything to do with the investor's age.

AB  - This study presents a retrospective of the Journal of Consumer Affairs (JCA) using bibliographic analysis between 1967 and 2019. The results indicate that both the number of JCA's publications and citations grew markedly over time. The dominant contributors to the journal are authors affiliated with U.S. institutions. Trends show increasing organizational diversity and collaboration among authors. The journal's central themes are consumer perception, consumer behavior, financial behavior, consumer spending patterns, financial literacy, consumer decision-making processes, and marketing practices. Statistically significant relationships exist between the following article attributes and citations based on our negative binomial regression analysis. Age has a negative association with citations, but the direction of association turns positive when considering non-linearity. A positive association exists between the number of authors, references, and U.S. affiliation. A negative relationship exists with article order, non-academic author, top institution affiliation (FT100), funding, lead article, title length, and conceptual article.

TI  - A GENDERED STUDY OF ATTITUDE TOWARDS MONEY IN DELHI NCR
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - Money Attitude determines the financial behavior of an individual. Both males and females are expected to demonstrate different money attitude due to difference in socialization and childhood orientations. This preliminary study attempts to determine the contrast in money attitude of males and females in Delhi and National Capital Region and present a comparative analysis in terms of their spending and saving habits. Data from 117 male respondents and 126 female respondents was collected. Money attitude was measured by adopting four sub-dimensions of Money Attitude Scale (MAS) developed by Yamauchi & Templer (1982). Descriptive analysis and independent t-test has been devised to test the dissimilarity in money attitude between male and female in Delhi NCR. The results bring about contrast across gender in terms of the four sub-dimensions of MAS. The research has implications for marketers, sociologist, economists, psychologists, and financial planners. The further research can be extended in terms of demographic factors.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EAST-WEST BUSINESS
AB  - Little research has investigated the relationship between FoMO (fear of missing out) and financial behavior and underlying this association remains largely unknown. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between envy and FoMO, investment involvement, investment engagement, and satisfaction. Proposed conceptual model was tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) among 1,741 individual investors. Research data were collected by convenience sampling method from individuals who are over 18 years of age and reported financial saving or individual investment. The inclusion criteria for participation included individuals over 18 years of age who reported financial saving or individual investment. Participants completed an online survey containing measurements regarding envy, FoMO, investment involvement, investment engagement, and satisfaction. The results indicated that there are significant and positive relationship between all of the constructs. This study highlights the underlying mechanism between FoMO and individual investment behavior, which has important theoretical and practical implications for understanding decision-making and behavior in the financial area.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose In Indonesia, the Islamic Economics and Finance Sector is growing rapidly, but the literature on Islamic financial literacy is still minimal. This study aims to show research opportunities with the theme of Islamic financial literacy, especially inclusive Islamic financial planning through bibliometric analysis of Scopus and connected papers. Design/methodology/approach A comma separated value (CSV) file containing more than 2,000 references meta data was used for analysis on Vos Viewer in the period of 1963-2020. The grouping of network visualization maps is done using six keywords, namely, "Financial Literacy," "Financial Inclusion," "Islamic Financial Literacy," "Financial Planning," "Personal Finance" and "Household Finance." Findings The findings complement the keywords that are generally used as references in the formation of theories regarding inclusive Islamic financial planning. After combining the "ris" file from the connected paper, the most used terms are financial knowledge, financial education, financial behavior, financial decision-making process, financial inclusion, risk sharing and financial discourse. Originality/value The proportion which planned to be applied in Indonesia will differentiate the inclusive Islamic financial planning framework from what has been done before. This study outlines the basis of the relevant literature review in the theme of Islamic financial literacy research, especially inclusive Islamic financial planning.

TI  - Robust Bayesian analysis of a multivariate dynamic model
T2  - PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB  - Recently, a Bayesian approach has been widely used to infer parameters of complex models from finite sample data in business, finance, social and physical sciences. Bayesian applications in finance literature are growing due to their exposure to prior beliefs that macroeconomic variables influence the financial behavior of customers, investors and firm's performance. This paper employs a robust Bayesian analysis model to capture a complex multi-dimensional process and estimate the required parameters of interest. It considers a class of prior distributions for the parameters that is a mixture of natural conjugate base priors and a contamination class of prior distributions. The conditional type-II maximum likelihood posterior densities and posterior means for the coefficients vector and autoregressive parameter are derived for the coefficients vector and autoregressive parameter of interest. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method has been used for obtaining the marginal posterior densities and Bayes estimators for various combinations of the parameters. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated on Indian financial firms' balance sheets data between 1992 to 2015 to observe the sensitivity of the proposed model. The result shows most of the corporate performance variables are significantly affecting the firm's profitability with the exception of interest coverage ratio. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Analyzing the Effects of Financial Education on Financial Literacy and Financial Behaviour: A Randomized Field Experiment in Croatia
T2  - SOUTH EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - In this paper, we examined the financial attitude and financial behavior of students and determined their level of financial literacy through a survey. We found that female students report less interest in finance, have less confidence in their financial abilities, and have a lower financial literacy score than male students. On average, we can conclude that students have a low level of financial literacy. In this study we found factors that influence financial literacy which are age, student's GPA, whether they already took some form of personal finance course, a proxy for numeracy, and place of birth in terms of a capital city. Furthermore, based on controlled experimental field research, we conducted financial training, and investigated causal evidence of the effectiveness of financial education. A training intervention to increase financial literacy was effective and improved financial attitude but increasing financial literacy through means of education was insufficient for making better financial decisions since students did not report a lower frequency of impulsive buying or a higher hypothetical savings rate. We found no evidence that female students were affected by this training any differently than male students.

TI  - THE MOVE TOWARDS CASHLESS SOCIETY: HOW TO IMPROVE CONSUMERS' USE OF BANK CARDS IN RETAIL STORES?
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The World Health Organization says money can spread all varieties of bacteria and viruses. A measure that can be taken to help stop the spread of Covid-19 is decreasing or ideally, eliminating, the use of cash and promoting the use of contactless payments. Cash remains a frequently used retail payment method specifically for small-value purchases. The switch from cash to cards and other payment methods is one of the major trends in consumer shopping financial behavior. This research investigates explaining factors of bank cards use for payment purposes. It builds on an integration of the Technology Acceptance Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior to explain customers' intention to use bank cards. Data was collected with a face-to-face survey in retailing context. The proposed model was tested through the PLS-SEM approach. Results show that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and attitude are prominent predictors of the behavioral intention to use bank cards for payment purposes in retail stores. The findings provide insights to service vendors and merchants on how to increase customers' use of cards rather than cash.

TI  - Irrational or Rational? Time to Rethink Our Understanding of Financially Responsible Behavior
T2  - ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Models of finance rationality expect individuals to actively prepare for retirement by consistently investing and building a diversified asset portfolio, with any behavior deviating from these expectations being identified as irresponsible. This framework of (ir)rationality and (ir)responsibility ignores the role of constraints in shaping financial behavior. Extending economic geographic insights on everyday financial practices as complex processes of meaning-making, we reveal how varied approaches to retirement savings are shaped by the experience of constraints inherent in a capitalist welfare state. Using the accounts of forty-two interviewed women and people with a minority ethnic background in the UK, we show how the interplay between everyday rationalities and structural constraints construct variegated financial subjectivities and practices that reflect the context that individuals face. Our findings contribute to the theorization of variegated financial subjects and disrupt the application of corrective policy measures, such as financial education, which put more pressure on individuals rather than tackling the inequalities inherent in the capitalist welfare state broadly and in the pension system specifically.

TI  - In the quest for effective factors of satisfaction with life: Insights from intra-couple interaction and financial management variables
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the factors affecting life satisfaction with reference to particular reports from both partners in the relationship. The study was conducted within a group of 500 heterosexual couples. The accuracy of the actor-partner interdependence models (APIM) which offer in-depth insights into the dyadic relationships between female and male partners were estimated. The results of the chi-square test enabled us to reject the hypothesis of actor indistinguishability, therefore the model proposing distinguishability with respect to gender was explored further. The results suggest that women's credit management behavior patterns predict changes in her assessment of well-being. Moreover, the financial behavior patterns of women have an impact on the assessment of well-being as reported by their male partners. Moreover, shared goals and values turned out to be significant with regard to the assessment of quality of life for both women and men. The obtained results provide an insight into the difficulties experienced within relationships and indicate the importance of the roles assumed in various areas of financial management.

TI  - MODELING OF EURO STOXX 50 INDEX PRICE RETURNS BASED ON INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION SURPRISES: BASIC AND MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - There are a big number of researches which analyzing stock price returns. Some of them is based on fundamental analysis theory. Meanwhile other studies are based on efficient market hypotheses and financial behavior theories. However, there is not enough researches combining the characteristics of these theories into one. Such kind of researches in the scientific literature is usually referred to macroeconomic news, announcements, surprises, expectations studies. These studies examine not only the actual but also the predictive values of macroeconomic indicators announcements, normalizing them and thus creating absolutely a new surprise indicator. Purpose of this paper is modeling EURO STOXX 50 index price returns based on Industrial production surprise indicator. Empirical part shows that the best models for explaining EURO STOXX 50 index price returns was obtained at the 40 and 42 in different surprise indicator scenario. The coefficient of determination was obtained respectively 24.70% and 21,80%. Meanwhile applying machine learning method of artificial intelligence, a much more accurate models were obtained. The coefficient of determination respectively was 33,22% and 26,60%.

TI  - Industry, Firm, and Country Level Dynamics of Capital Structure: A Case of Pakistani Firms
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The capital structure appears to be one of the most researched and the most controversial areas in modern corporate finance. Prior literature on determinants of capital structure has concentrated on firm and country level factors by employing static modeling. Static modeling has certain limitations, which do not allow companies to establish an optimum capital structure in line with economic uncertainty. This study makes a worthy contribution to the existing body of knowledge by filling the gap in the evolution of capital structure by employing a dynamic framework of the financial sector of Pakistan. In addition, the study brings into focus sectors' importance in determining the firm's financial behavior. Based on secondary financial sector data from 2006-2019, the article addresses the issues by employing two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM). The findings of the study validated the existence of dynamic capital structure across the financial sector of Pakistan and reinforced the substantial impact of sectors' unique environment on leverage mechanism. The results are robust under alternative estimation approaches and offer useful policy implications.

TI  - The role of social psychological factors in vulnerability to financial hardship
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Previous research attributes vulnerability to financial hardship either to structural inequities or to poor financial behavior. Less attention has been paid to the role of social psychological factors or to the relative contribution of demographics, behavior, and social psychology in understanding an individual's vulnerability to financial hardship. While studies have examined psychosocial factors in financial outcomes, we argue that these factors represent a missing perspective in the construction of interventions to lessen vulnerability. We further argue that a holistic perspective considering all three factors is needed to address vulnerability to financial hardship. Capitalizing on the richness of the CFPB National Financial Well-Being Survey data (n = 6394), we examine the unique contribution of psychosocial factors in explaining an individual's financial vulnerability over and above demographics and behaviors. Using four different measures of financial hardship, we find that all three types of factors play important roles in understanding vulnerability to financial hardship. Our findings suggest that more holistic measures and interventions are needed to enhance consumer financial well-being.

TI  - Integrating affect, cognition, and culture in Hispanic financial planning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - Debt is at a peak and consumers purport needing help with financial planning. To better understand the antecedents of financial planning behavior, the purpose of this paper is to examine the importance of cultural values in financial decision making within the context of Hispanic American consumers. A new conceptual model is proposed to integrate affect (cultural value) and cognition (financial knowledge) in financial planning.
   Design/methodology/approach - To uncover respondents' views on cultural values, financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial planning behavior, an online survey hosted on a business school's website was distributed to members of two Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. The survey consisted of five parts, and took each respondent an average of 15 minutes to complete. The final data set has 158 observations.
   Findings - Results analyzed using structural equation modeling confirmed the hypotheses that financial knowledge, attitude, and perceived control simultaneously influence Hispanic consumers' intentions to purchase financial planning products or services. More interestingly, these results confirm that multiple different routes coexist in the decision-making process, especially within the Hispanic financial planning context.
   Originality/value - Key contributions of this paper include the conceptualization of cultural value as an antecedent to Hispanic financial behavior; detailing the different routes to financial decision making for US Hispanic consumers; and informing financial service managers on marketing strategies toward Hispanic consumers.

TI  - Behavioral Factors on Individual Investors' Decision Making and Investment Performance: A Survey from the Vietnam Stock Market
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The stock market shows the current health of an economy, and investment performance represents it. This study aims to clarify the relationship between financial behavior and investment decisions as well as its impact on investment results. Determine the influence of behavioral factors on individual investors' investment decisions and investment performance on the Vietnam stock market. The study surveyed 250 investors. The main analytical methods used are Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Research results show that Heuristic, Prospect, Market, and Herding directly and positively affect investment decision-making. Besides, the above factors have a direct and positive effect on investment performance. In particular, the Prospect factor has the strongest influence on investment decision-making and investment performance. The major findings of this study suggested that the important role of Heuristic, Prospect, Market, and Herding on Investment Decision-making and Investment Performance. Prospect had the strongest impact on Investment decision-making (beta = 0.275). Heuristic had the second strongest impact (beta = 0.257), then Herding (beta = 0.202), and finally Market (beta = 0.189) had the weakest effect. Regarding Investment Performance, the Prospect factor has a higher degree of impact than Heuristic Herding and Market.

TI  - The Psychology of COVID-19 Economic Impact Payment Use
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - This study investigates how American adults' personality and financial self-efficacy (FSE) beliefs contributed to how they used their COVID-19 CARES Act Economic Impact Payment (EIP) for spending needs, spending wants, and financial transactions (save, invest, debt repayment). The results from a sample of 1172 Amazon MTurk users collected in July 2020 suggest that both personality traits and FSE beliefs were associated with EIP use. Specifically, this study finds that FSE and conscientiousness emerged as the most robust predictors of EIP use across all categories of financial behavior with a greater allocation of EIP funds to saving and less to spending needs and debt repayment. Additionally, greater FSE is associated with investing, while greater conscientiousness is connected to more spending on wants. The results suggest that saving habits associated with personality and FSE persist in a crisis environment, and pre-crisis preparedness may allow for greater spending flexibility on wants. Significant relationships were also found for openness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. The findings highlight how people use unexpected financial windfalls during crises and uncertainty and how personal characteristics contribute to this decision making.

TI  - The effect of testosterone on economic risk-taking: A multi-study, multi-method investigation*
T2  - HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR
AB  - Testosterone has been suggested to influence individuals' economic decision making, yet the effects of testos-terone on economic behavior are not well-understood and existing research is equivocal. In response, in three studies, we examined the extent to which testosterone affected or was associated with several different facets of economic decision making. Study 1 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study examining loss aversion and risk-taking (N = 26), whereas Study 2 was a larger double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subjects study examining loss aversion and risk-taking behavior (N = 117). As a methodological compliment, Study 3 was a larger correlational design (N = 213) with a highly accurate measure of endogenous testosterone examining a wider range of economic behaviors and trait-like preferences. Broadly, the results of all three studies suggest no consistent relationship between testosterone and financial behavior or preferences. Although there were significant effects in specific cases, these findings did not replicate in other studies or would not remain significant when controlling for family-wise error rate. We consider potential contextual moderators that may determine under what circumstances testosterone affects economic decision making.

TI  - The Relationship Between Financial Education in Young Adults and Financial Literacy: A Review of the Literature in Canada and the United States
T2  - ACCOUNTING PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Professional accounting bodies in Canada and the United States, and throughout the world, have funded programs to improve financial literacy for many years. This ongoing interest stems from the expected benefits of improved financial behavior for individuals, society, and financial markets. However, the fact that relatively little research on financial literacy has been published in accounting journals suggests that few accounting academics are aware of, interested in, or motivated to work on the topic. This review helps to identify what we know about the effectiveness of financial education programs intended specifically for young adults, who constitute the demographic group likely to gain the most from improved financial literacy. Our review identifies factors that impinge both on the effectiveness of financial education programs and the research examining these programs. Noteworthy factors include (1) a lack of theoretical frameworks to guide the programs and research on the programs, (2) a tendency for outcome measures to capture financial knowledge rather than financial behaviors, and (3) the need for stronger research designs. We also note some possible instructional design considerations in developing financial education programs and highlight financial literacy as a promising area of research for accounting academics. Our findings can help guide improvements to financial education programs and encourage further research to assess the effectiveness of financial literacy programs.

TI  - Socioemotional Wealth (SEW) of Family Firms and CEO Behavioral Biases in the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Agreed upon by the UN member states, Agenda 2030 assumes joint action for long-term sustainable development. These actions are focused on the implementation of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where actions are assumed to lead to the suppression of negative externalities of human activity. It is stressed that the objectives of sustainable development can only be achieved through deep institutional changes in most dimensions of the economy, including the entrepreneurship dimension. Entrepreneurship plays a pivotal role in the sustainable transformation of the community, as the related activities of companies are the source of the desired structural changes. Entrepreneurial projects make the biggest contribution to the objectives of sustainable development through research and development, investment in new technologies, and innovation. The biggest threat to sustainable entrepreneurship is firms' aggressive corporate financial strategy, which most often results from CEO overconfidence and aggressive financial behavior. The aim of the article is to indicate differences in corporate financial strategies regarding the status of the company (family or non-family) and CEO characteristics (overconfident or non-overconfident). The fulfilment of this aim by analyzing a selected EU member country (Poland) found more aggressive behavior of overconfident CEOs in non-family firms. It was also found that family firms are a fairly coherent group of companies that implement a more conservative corporate financial strategy regardless of CEO characteristics. We can state that family power can curb CEO overconfidence and its impact on aggressive financial strategy. This means that family firms are much more able to create sustainable entrepreneurship and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within a market framework.

TI  - Building financial resilience through financial and digital literacy in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - EMERGING MARKETS REVIEW
AB  - Globally, 1.7 billion adults still lack access to formal financial services, with a large percentage living in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Current financial inclusion strategies seek to enhance these vulnerable populations' access to financial services with the aim of building more inclusive and financially resilient societies. With the Fintech movement and over 67% of the world's population having a mobile phone, digital financial literacy is gaining momentum. Nevertheless, negligible research has measured its impacts on financial behavior. This study uses data from the InterMedia Financial Inclusion Insights (FII) surveys for seven South Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries to investigate the relationship between multidimensional measures of financial and digital literacy and resilience-building financial behaviors, including saving, borrowing, and risk management. The findings consistently show that both financial and digital literacy are key factors to building inclusiveness and financial resilience. Heterogeneities are identified across regions, as well as for poor, rural, and female households. A robustness check is also included to address potential endogeneity. The results emphasize the need to redefine traditional financial literacy to include digital literacy, with important implications for countries considering both as a dual approach to improving households' long-run financial resilience.

TI  - Online betting intensity is linked with Extraversion and Conscientiousness
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY
AB  - Introduction Extraversion and Conscientiousness are well-studied personality traits associated with reward processing and goal prioritization, respectively, and bear on individual differences in financial risk-taking. Using unique large datasets, we investigated the link between these traits and male online gamblers' actual betting participation and intensity.
   Method We combined datasets containing online horse betting data (during 2015-2016) from the Finnish monopoly betting company, administrative registry data from Statistics Finland, and personality trait measures from the Finnish Defence Forces corresponding to Extraversion and Conscientiousness as defined in the five-factor model. We modelled associations between these traits and betting participation (n = 471,968) and intensity (n = 11,217) among male horse bettors (age = 36-53).
   Results Controlling for demographics and IQ, individuals scoring high on Conscientiousness (or Extraversion) were less (or more) likely to bet and less (or more) intensive bettors-even when personality was measured 16-34 years before betting occurred. One SD personality score increase represented an annual decrease (Conscientiousness) or increase (Extraversion) of euro570-754 in spending.
   Conclusions Extraversion and Conscientiousness are implicated in real-life financial behavior with tangible consequences for individuals. These effects are stronger than for many known demographic variables used in gambling studies and persist up to 34 years after personality has been measured.

TI  - Static and Dynamic Evaluation of Financing Efficiency in Enterprises' Low-Carbon Supply Chain: PCA-DEA-Malmquist Model Method
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The dual-carbon target brings severe challenges to enterprise financing. Low-carbon supply chain financing has become a key measure by which enterprises break through the financing bottleneck. How to accurately evaluate and optimize the financial efficiency of a low-carbon supply chain is of great significance. We developed a financial behavior scale of the low-carbon supply chain for enterprises and constructed the evaluation index system for financing efficiency of enterprises' low-carbon supply chain. Based on the qualitative and quantitative data of 205 listed companies, we combine the PCA model with the DEA-Malmquist model to conduct static and dynamic analysis of the financing efficiency of enterprises' low-carbon supply chain. The results show that the financing efficiency of the culture, sports, and entertainment industries needs to be improved. The pure technical efficiency of information transmission, software, and information technology services is low. The total factor productivity index of water conservancy, environment and public facilities management, and the real estate industry fluctuated significantly. In this regard, enterprises must combine the characteristics of the industry and improve the financing efficiency of the supply chain using low-carbon processes of improvement, selection of low-carbon environmental protection materials, and collaborative supply chain emission reduction to break the financing constraints of enterprises and promote the realization of the national dual-carbon target.

TI  - Financial anxiety: a systematic review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeFinancial anxiety has become a global concern and a growing research area with significant potential to contribute to the behavioral and personal finance literature. Despite this, the literature is fragmented and inconsistent. Prior studies vary greatly in the breadth of definitions and measures of financial anxiety. There has been no systematic evaluation of literature on financial anxiety antecedents, consequences, and coping strategies. This systematic review fills this gap.Design/methodology/approachWe followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched Scopus and Web of Science and identified 55 eligible studies published between 2009 and 2024.FindingsFinancial anxiety is defined and measured differently in different research domains. We identified several antecedents, including socio-demographic factors (e.g. gender, age, ethnicity, income, employment, racial background, and language proficiency), personality traits, compulsive and impulsive buying behavior, depression or other mental issues, family health issues, and the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences of financial anxiety, including psychological and psychic health, societal and personal relations, financial behavior and well-being, and job-related outcomes. In addition, the literature presents six financial anxiety coping strategies (self-imposed coping mechanisms, spiritual and theological resources, increased financial capability, social and family support, seeking professional help, and language proficiency training). Several future research directions are presented.Originality/valueThis review represents the first systematic compilation and evaluation of the research findings on financial anxiety.

TI  - Unlocking the neural mechanisms of consumer loan evaluations: an fNIRS and ML-based consumer neuroscience study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - Introduction This study conducts a comprehensive exploration of the neurocognitive processes underlying consumer credit decision-making using cutting-edge techniques from neuroscience and machine learning (ML). Employing functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), the research examines the hemodynamic responses of participants while evaluating diverse credit offers.Methods The experimental phase of this study investigates the hemodynamic responses collected from 39 healthy participants with respect to different loan offers. This study integrates fNIRS data with advanced ML algorithms, specifically Extreme Gradient Boosting, CatBoost, Extra Tree Classifier, and Light Gradient Boosted Machine, to predict participants' credit decisions based on prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation patterns.Results Findings reveal distinctive PFC regions correlating with credit behaviors, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) associated with strategic decision-making, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) linked to emotional valuations, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) reflecting brand integration and reward processing. Notably, the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the right vmPFC contribute to positive credit preferences.Discussion This interdisciplinary approach bridges neuroscience, machine learning and finance, offering unprecedented insights into the neural mechanisms guiding financial choices regarding different loan offers. The study's predictive model holds promise for refining financial services and illuminating human financial behavior within the burgeoning field of neurofinance. The work exemplifies the potential of interdisciplinary research to enhance our understanding of human financial decision-making.

TI  - Socio-economic empowerment in rural India: Do financial inclusion and literacy matters?
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - Financial literacy as a major catalyst in the area of inclusive growth has obtained utmost prevalence, based on which this study intended to analyze the role of financial literacy in ensuring financial inclusion which further enhances socio-economic empowerment in rural areas of Karnataka, India. In order to conduct the study 398 responses (i.e. 93% response rate) were collected through comprehensive questionnaire which was then analyzed using SPSS 26 and SPSS AMOS 23 software, as SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) was used to evaluate the proposed conceptual model, as well as two-way ANOVA to analyze the demographic effect on the components. The study outcome confirmed that financial inclusion is highly affected by the financial literacy of a rural community in a direct way; but when they can take effective financial decision and are responsible in financial behavior, they tend to show more financial inclusion which has contributed to their socio-economic empowerment. Realizing the dominant role of financial literacy one of the key policy implications of this article is that the Indian government may begin spending considerable amounts of money to promote financial literacy, which can significantly expand financial inclusion. Furthermore, measures might be taken to discover the gaps in digital financial transaction (online and mobile banking) where the Government of India should be aggressive in building the infrastructure for financial inclusion, which would aid in the socio-economic growth of the rural people.

TI  - Financial self-efficacy: a determinant of financial inclusion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial self-efficacy (FSE) and financial inclusion (FI) among individual financial consumers in Uganda.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a quantitative approach and cross-sectional research design, a sample of 400 individuals from urban Central and rural Northern Uganda was drawn. SPSS and AMOS(TM) 21, regression analysis and structural equation models were used to establish the hypothesized relationship between FSE and FI.
   Findings - The results suggest a strong positive and significant relationship between FSE and FI. The results further suggest that other variables which were controlled for, such as age and gender, had significant influence on an individual's usage of formal financial services.
   Research limitations/implications - The study was assessed using both potential and actual consumers of financial services collectively. However, if separately assessed, possibly there would be a variation in behavioral responses toward FI.
   Practical implications - Formal financial service providers need to enhance individuals' levels of confidence in management of finances and utilization of formal financial products and services, so that the financial consumers can realize the changes in financial behavior and consequently FI. Social implications - The enhancement of individuals' level of confidence in evaluating the available financial service options will guide them to take financial decisions that will improve their livelihood.
   Originality/value - The results contribute toward the limited empirical and theoretical evidence for FSE and FI from a behavioral demand-side perspective.

TI  - Explainable AI for Psychological Profiling from Behavioral Data: An Application to Big Five Personality Predictions from Financial Transaction Records
T2  - INFORMATION
AB  - Every step we take in the digital world leaves behind a record of our behavior; a digital footprint. Research has suggested that algorithms can translate these digital footprints into accurate estimates of psychological characteristics, including personality traits, mental health or intelligence. The mechanisms by which AI generates these insights, however, often remain opaque. In this paper, we show how Explainable AI (XAI) can help domain experts and data subjects validate, question, and improve models that classify psychological traits from digital footprints. We elaborate on two popular XAI methods (rule extraction and counterfactual explanations) in the context of Big Five personality predictions (traits and facets) from financial transactions data (N = 6408). First, we demonstrate how global rule extraction sheds light on the spending patterns identified by the model as most predictive for personality, and discuss how these rules can be used to explain, validate, and improve the model. Second, we implement local rule extraction to show that individuals are assigned to personality classes because of their unique financial behavior, and there exists a positive link between the model's prediction confidence and the number of features that contributed to the prediction. Our experiments highlight the importance of both global and local XAI methods. By better understanding how predictive models work in general as well as how they derive an outcome for a particular person, XAI promotes accountability in a world in which AI impacts the lives of billions of people around the world.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY OF STUDENTS IN CHOSEN UNIVERSITIES - RESEARCH PLATFORM FOR REGULATORY PROCESSES OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IN SLOVAKIA
T2  - E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT
AB  - The main goal of this paper is to compare the level of financial literacy among the selected faculties of economics in Slovakia and to elaborate a comparison of financial literacy level at both input and output level, i.e. between the university students at the beginning of their Bachelor study and the university students who are in the final stage of their Master study. In addition, we want to analyze the level of financial literacy by means of practical tasks aimed at confirmation or rejection of the prospect theory principles. Concerning methods we statistically process our primary data which were collected through the survey 2015/2016 from Slovak University of economics in Kosice, Presov and Bratislava. Inter alia, we analyze correlative data dependence of selected variables. The survey is focused also on financial behavior of respondents and their skills in terms of financial literacy concept. Last but not least, we deal with features of respondents' financial decision making under the conditions of risk and uncertainty. At first, we show that statistically significant dependency of FL level on respondents' sex does exist. Male respondents reached higher FL than female ones. Hypothesis of better high school education of economy at Business Secondary School was rejected, rate of financially literate respondents who attended Grammar School or Business Secondary School is comparable. Subsequently, students in their last year of studies at EKF TUKE and NHF EUBA have significantly higher level of FL than those students who are at the beginning of their studies. Contrary, at FM PU the rate of financially illiterate first-year students was lower than the rate of financially literate students in their last year of studies. We found out a correlation of FL with decision-making based on prospect theory. The results of the presented research provide important information for policy makers who should reflect on present status of this issue in Slovakia.

TI  - E-Banking Convergence and the Adopter's Behavior Changing Across EU Countries
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - The concepts of internet banking and mobile banking have led to changes in people's financial behavior in terms of earning, consuming, and saving. This new concept, which entered the market quite recently, was used at the beginning of the new digital technology in various types of activities, banking operations, and nowadays these services are used by all people who want to save through banks or create new sources of income, as well as to make quick currency exchanges without going to credit institutions. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze people's behavior toward new digital technologies, e-banking adoption, and non-banking financial institutions internet services. The objectives pursued are: whether e-banking users are homogeneous in their characteristics in the EU 27 and which users have the most convergent or divergent behavior in the EU 27. Statistical data taken from Eurostat 2023 was used for the Sigma convergence analysis, the time series taken into consideration being from 2004 to 2022. The results showed that the changes in the procedural-fiscal-financial sphere are the ones that fully reflect the two principles underlying the tax evolution: digitization and simplification. These results confirm that people are adopting the new digital technology and change their behavior from consumer to prosumer. The study shows that all most categories adopted e-banking using new digital technologies when it comes to consumption and saving, with few exceptions that should be carefully supported.
   E-Banking convergence and the adopter's behaviour within the EU CountriesThe concepts of internet banking and mobile banking have led to changes in people's financial behavior in terms of earning, consuming, and saving.

These results confirm that people are adopting the new digital technology and change their behavior from consumer to prosumer. The study shows that all most categories adopted e-banking using new digital technologies when it comes to consumption and saving, with few exceptions that should be carefully supported. Digital transformation is not just about buying new, modern equipment, or retrieving data quickly and securely, but also about the technical implementation of state-of-the-art IT systems. It should be noted that digitization has had important effects on both public and private organizations and people, which can be translated as follows: time saved in people's interaction with public and private organizations; efficiency in administrative processes; transparency in their work. The economic environment becomes much more attractive and leads to investment and innovation in all areas. The digitization of all public or private services would also strengthen the administrative capacity of the whole population. Through studies, research, and future studies, it is essential to analyze and demonstrate that new digital technologies and their use could lead to the elimination of tax fraud, increased public confidence in local or central government and confidence in business. Finally, we can say that it is essential that new research in the field of digitization and e-banking use strengthens the literature reviews and explains at a higher level the answers to all research questions.

TI  - Financial Literacy on College Students in the Context of Tuxtepec, Oax
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The objective of this study is to determine the variables that explain the knowledge of financial literacy among college students in Tuxtepec, Oaxaca, and to identify whether the level of financial literacy that prevails in these students differs by gender, age and school grade. To do so, the study is based on a theoretical reference recently exposed by Goyal and Kumar (2021), who analyzed 502 articles between the years 2000 to 2019, in their findings they found that the gender gap and financial education, impacts on financial behavior. The participants of the study were 600 college students of a public sector Institution. The statistical procedure for data analysis was: first, the instrument was validated with Cronbach's alpha and normality through the values of skewness and kurtosis, then the correlation matrix, Brattle's test of Sphericity with Kaiser and the sample adequacy measure were calculated, and the extraction of components under the criterion of eigenvalues > to 1 and total variance. Finally, to verify if there is a difference in relation to the variables of financial education, gender, age and employment status, an ANOVA analysis is performed. Finally, the findings show that there is a difference between the variables: Gender and financial literacy (Saving and Investment); Age (Spending and Credit); Employment Status (Income, Money Management, Spending and Credit, Saving and Investment). This leads us to think that the higher level student presents a low level of financial knowledge, which could affect their personal growth, and that the gap of gender, age and employment status makes a difference in relation to the variables studied.

TI  - Households' intentions under financial vulnerability conditions: is it likely for the COVID-19 pandemic to leave a permanent scar?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The authors draw on psychological reactance theory, collective mental programming, psychological profiles and financial vulnerability experiences to assess the possibility that the pandemic may induce transformative changes in households' behavioral intentions related to financial decisions after the pandemic is over. Design/methodology/approach Using a unique survey data drawn from four different countries located in North America, Europe, Africa and Latin America, the authors show that the stressful conditions that accompanied the pandemic have instigated a state of financial vulnerability and stimulated instinctual defensive mechanisms among consumers. Findings The study results indicate that households have intentions to make defensive decisions in spending, consumption, planning and investment. Furthermore, the authors report evidence that personal psychological heterogeneity (as an individual factor) and collective mental programming (as a cultural factor) play a significant role in shaping households' postpandemic financial intentions. Research limitations/implications The study findings carry important practical implications. For financial institutions, marketers and financial advisors, the authors' work implies that individual and collective factors affect people's perception and behavioral intentions in response to financial adversities. For social planners and legislators, the authors' work shows that they should expect not only short-term but also long-term reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Originality/value Most research on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on households' financial behavior focuses on transitional adjustments made during the pandemic, and little emphasis has been placed on potential postpandemic adjustments. The authors contend that it would be a mistake to analyze the pandemic-induced crisis as a temporary financial hardship.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Financial Education, and Downstream Financial Behaviors
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - Policy makers have embraced financial education as a necessary antidote to the increasing complexity of consumers' financial decisions over the last generation. We conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship of financial literacy and of financial education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201 prior studies. We find that interventions to improve financial literacy explain only 0.1% of the variance in financial behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples. Like other education, financial education decays over time; even large interventions with many hours of instruction have negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time of intervention. Correlational studies that measure financial literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We conduct three empirical studies, and we find that the partial effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial literacy to control for omitted variables. Financial education as studied to date has serious limitations that have been masked by the apparently larger effects in correlational studies. We envisage a reduced role for financial education that is not elaborated or acted upon soon afterward. We suggest a real but narrower role for "just-in-time" financial education tied to specific behaviors it intends to help. We conclude with a discussion of the characteristics of behaviors that might affect the policy maker's mix of financial education, choice architecture, and regulation as tools to help consumer financial behavior.

TI  - Is It Necessary to Launch a School-Based Financial Literacy Curriculum? Evidence From China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - As starting university is a critical independence milestone for many young people, it would also be the best time to provide them with some financial education (FE). Although there have been many initiatives aimed at enhancing individual financial literacy (FL) and/or financial decision-making, meta-analyses have shown that the effectiveness of FE has been mixed. This study examined the driving forces behind the decision by college students to enroll in a targeted financial literacy curriculum (FLC) and the impact of this attendance on their FL. An endogenous switching model (ESM) was employed to account for the heterogeneity in the decision to attend or not attend the FLC and to counteract any unobservable characteristics. It was found that students with higher self-perceived FL did not prefer to attend the FLC; however, for others, FLC attendance was found to significantly boost their FL in areas such as financial knowledge (FK), financial attitude (FA), and financial behavior (FB), especially for the non-attendees under the counterfactual framework. These "non-attendees" were observed to have some characteristics (e.g., prior knowledge) that made them more financially literate regardless of attendance; however, if they had attended the FLC, they would have gained a greater FL than the attendees. As the FL of the attendees would have been much lower if they had not attended, the FLC appeared to be particularly important for the attendees, which strengthened the case for making the FLC a compulsory part of a general college education.

TI  - The WALLET Study: Examining Early Memory Loss and Personal Finance
T2  - INNOVATION IN AGING
AB  - Background and Objectives This feasibility study tests a new approach for assessing personal finance in older persons with early memory loss. The project examines 2 primary outcomes that gauge the financial viability and well-being of older adults: wealth loss and financial exploitation. The overall objective is to determine the association of financial literacy and management, financial decision-making, and cognition with wealth loss and financial exploitation. Research Design and Methods This cross-sectional study recruited 46 participants who were 60 years of age or older. Participants were classified as having mild cognitive impairment, perceived cognitive impairment, or no cognitive impairment. The study coordinator arranged with each participant to obtain copies of their main checking account statements for 12 consecutive months within the previous 2 years and, if appropriate, credit card statements. All statements were de-identified and assigned a random ID number. Participants then completed 2 telephone interviews. Results The average participant age was 72 years (standard deviation [SD] = 7.7); 84% were female, 39% White, and 35% currently married. Average education was 16.2 years (SD = 2.4); mean yearly household income was almost $42,000 (SD = 25,752); and monthly social security payments averaged $1,446 (SD = 1,244). Our results indicate that the methods used to analyze checking account statements, followed by telephone interviews to verify identified trends, were useful in developing a financial behavior index to measure wealth loss. Discussion and Implications We demonstrate an alternative method for assessing personal finance using person-centered principles, which we believe are critical in the presence of diminished or impaired cognition. Our findings offer an innovative method for assessing the risk for wealth loss and financial exploitation.

TI  - Risky decision-making strategies mediate the relationship between amygdala activity and real-world financial savings among individuals from lower income households: A pilot study
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH
AB  - Lower financial savings among individuals experiencing adverse social determinants of health (SDoH) increases vulnerabilities during times of crisis. SDoH including low socioeconomic status (low-SES) influence cognitive abilities as well as health and life outcomes that may perpetuate poverty and disparities. Despite evidence suggesting a role for financial growth in minimizing SDoH-related disparities and vulnerabilities, neurobiological mechanisms linked with financial behavior remain to be elucidated. As such, we examined the relationships between brain activity during decision-making (DM), laboratory-based task performance, and money savings behavior. Participants (N = 24, 14 females) from low-SES households (income<$20,000/year) underwent fMRI scanning while performing the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), a DM paradigm probing risky- and strategicDM processes. Participants also completed self-report instruments characterizing relevant personality characteristics and then engaged in a community outreach financial program where amount of money saved was tracked over a 6-month period. Regarding BART-related brain activity, we observed expected activity in regions implicated in reward and emotional processing including the amygdala. Regarding brain-behavior relationships, we found that laboratory-based BART performance mediated the impact of amygdala activity on real-world behavior. That is, elevated amygdala activity was linked with BART strategic-DM which, in turn, was linked with more money saved after 6 months. In exploratory analyses, this mediation was moderated by emotionrelated personality characteristics such that, only individuals reporting lower alexithymia demonstrated a relationship between amygdala activity and savings. These outcomes suggest that DM-related amygdala activity and/or emotion-related personality characteristics may provide utility as an endophenotypic marker of individual's financial savings behavior.

TI  - A multi-attribute data mining model for rule extraction and service operations benchmarking
T2  - BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose Customer differences and similarities play a crucial role in service operations, and service industries need to develop various strategies for different customer types. This study aims to understand the behavioral pattern of customers in the banking industry by proposing a hybrid data mining approach with rule extraction and service operation benchmarking. Design/methodology/approach The authors analyze customer data to identify the best customers using a modified recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) model and K-means clustering. The number of clusters is determined with a two-step K-means quality analysis based on the Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin and Calinski-Harabasz indices and the evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS). The best-worst method (BWM) and the total area based on orthogonal vectors (TAOV) are used next to sort the clusters. Finally, the associative rules and the Apriori algorithm are used to derive the customers' behavior patterns. Findings As a result of implementing the proposed approach in the financial service industry, customers were segmented and ranked into six clusters by analyzing 20,000 records. Furthermore, frequent customer financial behavior patterns were recognized based on demographic characteristics and financial transactions of customers. Thus, customer types were classified as highly loyal, loyal, high-interacting, low-interacting and missing customers. Eventually, appropriate strategies for interacting with each customer type were proposed. Originality/value The authors propose a novel hybrid multi-attribute data mining approach for rule extraction and the service operations benchmarking approach by combining data mining tools with a multilayer decision-making approach. The proposed hybrid approach has been implemented in a large-scale problem in the financial services industry.

TI  - Intention to use buy-now-pay-later payment system among university students: a combination of financial parenting, financial self-efficacy, and social media intensity
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - In the last five years, new 'buy now pay later' (BNPL) and digital credit services have gained popularity among young people, including university students. Despite offering processing conveniences compared to traditional consumer credit, BNPL usage among students raises concerns about the risk of unsustainable debt levels. This research aims to examine the impact of financial parenting on student's financial self-efficacy and their use of BNPL services. In addition, the study investigated how financial self-efficacy and social media intensity (SMI) affect the relationship between financial parenting and the intention to use BNPL services. The data from 354 second-year university students were analyzed using a moderated mediation model through macro process ver 4.0. The results revealed that financial parenting positively influences financial self-efficacy and reduces university students' likelihood of using BNPL services. Moreover, financial self-efficacy directly affects the intention to use BNPL and is a mediator between financial parenting and the intention to use BNPL. The study also found that SMI has a dual role in predicting the intention to use BNPL services and moderating the relationship between financial parenting and the student's intention to use BNPL. IMPACT STATEMENT In recent years, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) method has undergone significant developments. This method allows consumers to buy goods and pay later with installments or defer payments for a certain period. It has become increasingly popular, especially among the younger generation who value convenience and flexibility in shopping. However, excessive debt and unwise financial management are risks associated with this method, particularly among students. Our study focused on the intention of college students to use BNPL, considering financial parenting, financial self-efficacy, and social media intensity. The results of our study can be useful for parents and educators in monitoring and controlling students' financial behavior, especially regarding the use of BNPL

TI  - Comparative analysis of Poland and selected countries in terms of household financial behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - EQUILIBRIUM-QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND ECONOMIC POLICY
AB  - Research background: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the reduction in income or the total loss of jobs have affected the financial behaviour of consumers worldwide. Managing the budget in times of turbulence and crisis has posed a challenge for households.
   Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to determine to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the financial behaviour of the inhabitants of various countries and how Poland has stood out from the rest.
   Methods: Due to the orderly nature of the questions analysed, non-parametric tests were used in the analysis. The distribution of current expenditure in comparison with the period before the pandemic was analysed, as well as the results of comparative analyses with Mann-Whitney U tests for comparison of Poland with Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France (974), Germany, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the USA. A study was carried out on the relationship between planning for the future, having debts and savings and financial behaviour after the COVID-19 pandemic and the metric variables in the group of Poles via Chi square and a series of Tau Kendall's tests.
   Findings & value added: There has been a fall in expenditure compared to the period before the pandemic, which may explain the lack of opportunities to spend money, the fall in revenue and the freezing of expenditure for fear of an uncertain future. There has also been a change in the way payments are made. Payment cards and purchases made over the Internet are increasingly popular. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers are trying to save more, but not everyone can afford to do so. Long-term value added of this paper is analysis of change in the model of financial behavior of households under the shock of the pandemic in international comparisons of the analysed countries.

TI  - Understanding sources of financial well-being in Romania: A prerequisite for transformative financial services
T2  - JOURNAL OF SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which financial behavior and financial well-being are affected by cognitive and non-cognitive factors in a specific Romanian post-communist context. This study shows that financial well-being is significantly linked to both financial education and to a set of non-cognitive factors. This paper offers strategic insights on what financial services should communicate to consumers and how they should be communicated, achieve the mutual benefits of the transformative paradigm.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study uses an online sample of 1,602 participants, representative of the general population in Romania concerning income and education, to collect data on financial anxiety, financial security and financial saving behavior (dependent variables), self-control, optimism, future orientation, deliberative thinking and financial literacy (independent variables). This paper measures the latent constructs - as composite indices, using partial least squares - path modeling. Working with WarpPLS software version 6.0 allows exploration of both linear and non-linear relationships involved in the model, along with their practical and managerial implications.
   Findings
   The results indicate that the key component to address in the development of financial services (in the post-soviet context) is financial anxiety. This study finds that, in contrast to Western countries, in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE), financial education is not always a panacea. Additionally, financial security is not always the most important goal for consumers.
   Practical implications
   This paper suggests managerial recommendations for redefining the relationship between banks and the Romanian population, focused mainly on diminishing financial anxiety and increasing financial security, as key elements of transformative financial services.
   Originality/value
   The study highlights the significant role played by behavioral variables in shaping financial well-being in Romania, being among the very few investigations illustrating the relevance of the topic in post-communist countries. This research shows unique challenges for the design of transformative financial services in a specific (post-communist) setting and provides insights on how financial services marketing can become more effective in the CESEE region.

TI  - Is household registration system responsible for the limited participation of stock market in China?
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the effect of China's unique household registration system (hukou) on stock market participation. Design/methodology/approach In an effort to estimate the effect of hukou on households' financial behavior, we draw on data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and use probit model and tobit model to test the effect of hukou on households stock market participation. Findings The results are with strong interpretative power over the limited participation of stock market in China-investors living in urban areas with urban hukou are more likely to participate in stock markets and allocate a larger fraction of financial assets to stocks and remarkably robust to a battery of robustness checks. The dual structure of social security caused by the household registration system could explain this result. Furthermore, marriage plays such a role of integrating social resources attached to hukou that only the marriage of individuals with urban hukou could significantly promote households' participation in the stock market. For married families, a household in which both husband and wife have urban hukou has a greater possibility to invest in stocks relative to those with rural hukou. Originality/value This paper contributes to the literature in two ways. First, much literature focuses on the stock market limited participation puzzle and gives explanations from the perspectives of individual heterogeneity and financial markets. This paper examines the effect of hukou. Such an idea is instructive to some developing countries where residents are treated differently because of the institutional reason. Second, the effects we find are economically meaningful. Our estimates indicate that medical insurance attached to hukou can explain almost 58% of the impact of hukou, which suggests that the key to reforming China's current household registration system is to make welfare separate from hukou. Moreover, homogamy based on hukou widens the gap of households' risky assets, which provides a new view to understand the income gap in the cities of China and the heterogeneous effect of marriage on stock market participation.

TI  - IMPROVING FINANCIAL EDUCATION STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
T2  - ECONOMICS ECOLOGY SOCIUM
AB  - Introduction. Modern society has long agreed that financial education is one of the pillars of its sustainable development. In many countries, action plans were prepared, strategies developed, training courses were aimed at increasing the level of financial education, but after a few years it is again clear that the problem has not been solved, there are very few examples of success and it is not known whether these successes are the result of the above measures. The need of change the strategies in place today in financial education is slowly emerging. There is an urgent task of improving the strategy of financial education at the present stage of development of society.
   Aim and tasks. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the current financial education strategy on the example of one particular country - Georgia, its logical consequences and find the levers that will make this strategy more effective or outline the contours of the new strategy.
   Results. The results of the work done in Georgia in the field of financial education over the past six years were analyzed. Comparison of the stated goals and actual results of the current strategies of financial education is carried out. The study is based on the analysis of the determinants of financial behavior of human, the main postulates of behavioral economics. The methods of logical generalization, synthesis, analysis and deduction are widely used in the research to reveal the cause-and-effect relationship between mental models of thinking, financial education and financial stability of the individual. Also examined the development policy measures adopted by the World Bank. An assessment of their relevance for improving financial education is carried out. The importance of considering mental models of thinking in achieving goals set in various spheres of society was noticed. Also, as a result of the analysis, new approaches were identified that improve the strategy of financial education.
   Conclusions. Strategies need to be developed based on the mental models of the population of a particular country taking into account the psychological aspects that are significant for the members of a given community. It is necessary to process the information provided by the population, not only semantically, but also etymologically, within the framework of the measures outlined in the strategy and use categories in the context to which the society is more sensitive. More successful examples of financial education development policies need to be considered.

TI  - Role of Parental Financial Socialisation on Financial Literacy among Youth
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The purpose of the study is to investigate the role of parental financial socialization on the financial literacy among the youth between the age group of 15-24. The study analyzed four variables of parental financial socialization on the financial literacy. Parental financial socialization is the deliberate process of bringing up the children in such a way that the financial knowledge, skills and attitude is being transferred, which may reflect in their financial behavior and outcomes. These variables were identified based on the relationship exhibited, financial decision making, teaching method adopted and responsiveness that the parent and child may share. As it is evident from the existing literatures that parental financial socialization is identified as the primary factor which influences the financial knowledge and behavior of any individual, the effort was made to focus on the younger generation based on the selected variables namely financial teaching and monitoring, financial budgeting, parental relationship and parental responsiveness. Financial literacy plays a vital role in the capital formation, thereby leading to productive investments and ultimately to the economic development of the country. Financial literacy has three dimensions, which includes financial knowledge, attitude and behavior. The study only focused on the awareness and attitude of the youth based on the family socialization.The data was randomly collected from 100 respondents by framing a structured questionnaire from the state of Kerala.The data analysis was doneon the parental influence to the financial literacy by conducting regression analysis on financial literacy and the four variables of parental financial socialization. It was found that the financial teaching and monitoring is not having a significant relationship with financial literacy. It was also found that, the most influencing variables being parental relationship with their children and family budgeting by the involvement of the youth.The overall effect of the variables on the financial literacy was made by using multiple linear regression. The results indicate that the four variables under the study are not much explaining their effect on the financial literacy, as such the inference is drawn as parental socialization factors have no significant effect on the financial literacy among the youth. The financial literacy and its effect on the demographic variables like gender, educational qualification and employment status was made. The result from the study indicated that male youth were more inclined to financial knowledge than the counterpart. But the Mann Whitney U test indicates that there is no gender difference. The educational qualification possessed by the youth does not indicate a positive relationship with the literacy. It was found that the financial literacy is different among the employed youth and the unemployed youth.One third of the sample indicated that they were unaware of the importance of savings as they were not motivated by their parents to make them save, when they were between the age of 8-15. The study tries to shed some lights on the increasing need for parental involvement in bringing up the youth so as to make them more inclined to savings and investment.

TI  - The Impact of Controlling Shareholders' Share Pledge on Enterprise's Innovation Investment-Evidence from Listed Firms in Coastal Region of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Utilizing the data of A-share listed companies in Chinese coastal areas from 2008 to 2017, this paper empirically analyses the relationship between the pledge of controlling shareholders' equity and the enterprise innovation. The results show that: (1) Controlling shareholders' share pledge will restrain innovation investment, but this negative impact will only play a role when the share pledge rate is high; (2) After subdividing the nature of property rights, it is found that the restraint of controlling shareholders' share pledge on enterprise innovation is more significant in coastal non-state-owned enterprises than in state-owned enterprises.

TI  - Exploring undergraduates' money-management life: insight from an emerging economy
T2  - YOUNG CONSUMERS
AB  - Purpose Undergraduates are expected to be future leaders responsible for business and nations. Given that sound financial decision-making is critical to their success in their careers and lives, it is important to understand the money-management behaviour of undergraduates. In the context of developing countries, the body of knowledge on money-management behaviour is dominated by functional financial literature and there is little research on factors beyond this. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring economic, social and psychological factors that influence money-management behaviour of undergraduates in a developing nation (Sri Lanka) and how undergraduates respond to these influences. Design/methodology/approach The study used a qualitative exploratory approach. Data collection was carried out using focus group discussions and individual interviews amongst undergraduates in a leading Sri Lankan state university. Findings The results indicate that undergraduates adopted both careful and risky money-management approaches. The subthemes, specifically identified under economic, social and psychological factors, revealed how undergraduates responded to each of these factors and the influence of contextual and cultural differences in their money-management behaviour. Research limitations/implications - Findings of the study revealed the importance of promoting innovative educational strategies to change the dependability mindset of undergraduates and to promote stress-management strategies that will assist them to enhance their personalities and creativity in making financial decisions. Theoretical and practical implications and future research directions are provided. Originality/value The literature scores in developing context are limited to exploring the existing pattern and the levels of the functional financial literacy. This study has deepened the authors' understanding of how the developing context affects undergraduates' response to the factors relating to their money-management behaviour. The findings from this study will be useful to government, financial institutions, educational institutions, parents and those who have a keen interest in encouraging healthy money-management behaviour in undergraduates.

TI  - Responsible access to credit for sole-traders and micro-organizations under unstable market conditions with psychometrics
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - In a context of market volatility, the growing complexity of financial products, and a shift towards self-employment, there is an increasing demand for inclusive financial services for sole traders and micro-organizations. To address this need, we conducted a study using real-time data from a Fintech lender in the Czech Republic to assess the effectiveness of a new financial literacy based psychometric credit scoring model (PSM) in improving access to finance for micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSME) sector, particularly sole traders, and micro-organizations, during volatile market conditions. This study affirms that PSMs play a significant role in responsibly including this underserved sector. Specifically, we observed a 30% higher approval rate and a 23% lower default rate when utilizing the PSM versus the traditional credit scoring model (TCSM). Moreover, during the period of substantial market volatility and instability, such as the state-of-emergency during the COVID-19 pandemic, the PSM exhibited a 13% higher approval rate at a 20% lower default rate than the TCSM. This evidence supports the proposition that PSMs offer a viable option for promoting financial inclusion and targeted financial education among MSMEs in the face of instable financial markets.

TI  - Motivation for emergency and retirement saving: an examination of Regulatory Focus Theory
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Can Regulatory Focus Theory be used to better understand consumers' saving attitudes and behaviours? The theory posits that prevention- and promotion-oriented personality traits may influence financial decision making. Using secondary and experimental survey data, two research questions were examined: (1) Are promotion- and prevention-related saving goals, in combination with promotion- and prevention-oriented personality traits, related to attitudes towards saving behaviour? (2) To what extent does the match between these goals and traits affect actual saving behaviour? Findings confirmed that promotion-oriented consumers were less likely to save for prevention goals, while the opposite was true for prevention-oriented individuals. Further, consumers' saving goal and personality trait-based regulatory focus were found to influence cognitive attitudes towards saving. The discussion focuses on how these findings and theoretical perspectives may predict and influence consumers' financial decision making.
