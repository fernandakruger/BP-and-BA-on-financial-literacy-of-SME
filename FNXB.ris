TI  - Self-esteem, financial knowledge and financial behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Financial knowledge is an important but insufficient driver of responsible financial behavior. Having a positive evaluation of oneself may also be essential for individuals to initiate and persist with the daunting process of financial management. In this study, we distinguish subjective financial knowledge from objective financial knowledge, and we propose that self-esteem relates to financial behavior both directly as well as indirectly through subjective financial knowledge. Results based on a nationally representative dataset of U.S. adults suggest that self-esteem significantly relates to individual financial behavior after controlling for financial knowledge and other socioeconomic factors. The association between self-esteem and financial behavior could be both direct and indirect through subjective financial knowledge. These findings highlight the importance of psychological traits such as self-esteem in explaining financial behavior difference. Its implications are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Culture and confidence in financial knowledge testing
T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - This paper studies the effect of cultural differences in confidence on financial knowledge test answering behaviour. Using Australian household survey data, I examine a sample of second generation and early arriving first generation immigrants as their differing cultures can be separated from the common economic and institutional environment they experience. Individuals from collectivist countries of ancestry are 9.1% more likely to respond with 'don't know' compared to those from individualist countries of ancestry. Results are robust to controlling for individual and country level factors, alternative measures of culture, a battery of sensitivity tests on sample selection criteria and subsample analysis. Additional analysis reveals that women from a collectivist country of ancestry are 21% more likely to respond with 'don't know' than males from an individualist country of ancestry. These findings call into the question the validity of financial knowledge tests in solely assessing knowledge.

TI  - Bank customers complaints, financial knowledge and gender
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING-REVISTA ESPANOLA DE FINANCIACION Y CONTABILIDAD
AB  - This work aims to analyse the relationship between financial knowledge and the propensity of consumers to complain in the event of disagreement with a financial institution. A sample of 8,286 individuals from the Survey of Financial Competencies elaborated by the Bank of Spain is analysed. The results reveal that individuals with greater financial knowledge show a greater propensity to complain, presumably due to their heightened ability to detect possible fraud or abusive practices by financial entities. Gender itself is not relevant in the propensity to complain. However, when the sample is divided by gender, financial knowledge is more relevant for women than men. Additionally, the results reveal that in the female sample, propensity to complain is affected by self-confidence, in contrast to the male sample. The results suggest that the authorities should take practical steps to include financial knowledge in the educational curriculum.

TI  - Are there urban-rural gaps in Spaniards financial knowledge?
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - Our objective is to analyze whether there are urban-rural gaps in financial knowledge of Spanish people. For this purpose, we use data from the Survey of Financial Competences conducted by the Bank of Spain and the Spanish National Securities Market Commission on a representative sample of the Spanish population aged between 18 and 79 during the last quarter of 2016 and the first half of 2017. From this microdata base, we estimate qualitative response models in which each of the dimensions of financial knowledge (inflation, compound interest and risk diversification) acts as dependent variable on a set of explanatory variables. Among the latter is one that measures whether the respondent lives in an urban or rural area. Our results reveal that there are urban-rural gaps in the financial knowledge of Spaniards over 39 years old. We also find conclusive results about the effect of other socioeconomic factors on the financial knowledge of Spaniards. Thus, the probability of being financially illiterate is higher for those who are women and have low income and low educational attainment. Meanwhile, being born in another country, self-confidence, and contracting financial products are all of them factors that have positive implications for financial knowledge of Spanish population.

TI  - Self-employment, financial knowledge, and retirement planning
T2  - JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - The level of self-employed individuals' financial knowledge holds implications with respect to financial stability, economic welfare, and growth of young enterprises. This study found that self-employed individuals did not differ significantly from employed workers in terms of their financial knowledge. Self-employed workers were less likely than employed workers to be engaged in financial practices that improved their long-term financial health. However, there was no difference in the level of confidence in future retirement prospects between self-employed individuals and their employed counterparts. With the ongoing erosion of social protection systems, this research provides a basis for addressing the issue of relatively poor retirement planning among self-employed workers.

TI  - Measuring financial knowledge: a macroeconomic perspective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS AND ECONOMIC POLICY
AB  - Building an indicator which measures countries' financial knowledge allowing comparisons between them and throughout time is the objective of this paper. Currently, this is a lack in this research field, whose previous works were oriented to microeconomic analysis using survey that not only covered interviewees' financial knowledge but also some of their individual characteristics (e.g. race, ethnic, gender, age, among others). Perhaps that is why there is empirical evidence about the effect of this knowledge on matters such as saving and retirement planning, stock market participation, product and services choice, or over-indebtedness, for example. But its effects on economic variables like development and inequality (among others) have hardly been explored. Therefore, the longitudinal design of our Financial Knowledge Index might contribute to turn definitively towards the macroeconomic perspective in this incipient research field. Our results are consistent with previous works and reveal those countries which have more robust and more mature financial system (some of them have financial matters in their school curricula) register better positions respect with the rest of them.

TI  - Validating Financial Knowledge Scale Using Item Response Theory
T2  - VISION-THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
AB  - It is important to have knowledge about financial products and services to make rational financial decisions. Financial knowledge is a wider term and hence difficult to measure. The previous studies have used various methods and instruments to measure it. But there is a need of comprehensive and validated instrument to measure the financial knowledge. In this study, an attempt has been made to measure financial knowledge using a scale consisting of multiple-choice questions on basic and specific financial knowledge related with banking products and services. Each correct answer has been scored '1' and each wrong answer has been scored '0'. This dichotomous scale has been validated using Item Response Theory. The theory focuses on the appropriateness of the questions (items) included in the scale with respect to difficulty and discriminability. The results reveal that the overall instrument fulfils both the criteria. The test consisting of twenty-two items is reliable as well as valid with the discrimination index having all positive values ranging from 0.23 to 1.96 and the difficulty index ranging from -5.66 to 0.90. The purpose of this article is to encourage the usage of validated scales for the measurement of financial knowledge and discourage the perplexity in the field of financial knowledge and financial literacy.

TI  - Gender differences in financial knowledge overconfidence among older adults
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - This study explores gender differences in financial knowledge overconfidence among older adults using the 2016 Health and Retirement Study. We find that older females have relatively lower objective financial knowledge than do older males, while they evaluate themselves to be as financially knowledgeable as older males. Further, several measures of overconfidence in financial knowledge are higher in older females than older males. A number of robustness checks, including a propensity score matching method, use of a polygenic risk scores, and a test of reproduction using the Survey of Consumer Finances corroborate these gender differences. Results from decomposition analyses of overconfidence indices show that relatively lower crystallized intelligence of older females is one of the main reasons that widens the gender gap among older adults. Lower likelihoods of attaining a college education degree and being in a relationship are additional contributing factors that explain the gender gap. This study provides insights into understanding the gender gap in financial knowledge and its implications for government education or intervention programs to support older adults' wellbeing in retirement.

TI  - Self-employment, gender, financial knowledge, and high-cost borrowing
T2  - JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Poor financial decisions are a primary cause of small firm failure. This research therefore reports on an examination of antecedents behind questionable financial borrowing practices among self-employed individuals. Poor financial decisions are proxied as the use of high-cost short-term payday loans, check-cashing services, and the like (collectively, alternative financial services, AFS). More than 20 percent of self-employed individuals in the United States reported having borrowed from AFS providers, a practice that is arguably symptomatic of the poor financial decisions that could lead to business failure. Self-employed individuals, particularly those with high levels of financial self-efficacy (an attribute important to entrepreneurship) are particularly likely to employ AFS borrowing. Overconfident individuals, including self-employed individuals, comprise a disproportionate fraction of AFS users. This work also found that financial knowledge among self-employed people is, on average, no higher than that among employees, and low financial knowledge is also associated with AFS usage. Women, even though generally less financially knowledgeable than men, are relatively less likely than men to use AFS borrowing.

TI  - Financial knowledge of university students in Korea and Germany
T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB  - This study compares the financial knowledge of Korean (N = 1006) and German (N = 1346) university students. The country-specific adaptations of the US-American Test of Financial Literacy was used to assess financial knowledge. Financial knowledge can be divided into three areas (everyday money management; banking; insurance). German students show a slightly higher knowledge of everyday money management and insurance. Korean students tend to be stronger in the area banking. The paper examines the impact of gender on financial knowledge and the role of financial information gathering. A gender difference is determined in Germany, but not in Korea. Male students in Germany score higher than female students. An analysis of variance shows that Korean as well as German students who inform themselves more frequently about financial topics achieve a higher financial knowledge score. The article shows that it is possible to validly measure financial knowledge in Germany and Korea, which have different economic systems.

TI  - PREDICTING INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR'S INTENTION TO INVEST: A COMPARISON BETWEEN ACTUAL AND PERCEIVED FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - This paper aimed to empirically check and evaluate statistically significant differences in structural relationships of actual and perceived financial knowledge, risk tolerance, and risky investment intention, via in total of 995 questionnaires sent to a sample group of the informal laborers in southern Thailand. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was used to analyze the results. It is worth noting that even though both actual and perceived financial knowledge affected each individual's risk tolerance, still perceived knowledge affected more the individual's risk tolerance. The actual and perceived financial knowledge that the individuals possess would enable them to make sound investments. Our study added the multi-group analyses in order to investigate if gender affected each individual's decision-making on investment. The results revealed that in the case of men, both actual and perceived financial knowledge positively correlated with risky investment intention, whereas in the case of women only actual financial knowledge did. The key point from our study indicated that confidence or self-perceived knowledge was a significant factor affecting individual decision-making on investments. Hence, the educators and policymakers should provide effective lessons on financial knowledge by creating actual knowledge in order to help avoid overconfidence.

TI  - Give mind to the gap: Measuring gender differences in financial knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Prior research consistently finds a gender gap in financial knowledge where males appear to outperform females. Despite the wealth of studies attempting to explain this gap, none have considered whether the gender gap may be a product of measurement method. This study re-examines the gender gap with item response theory (IRT) which can account for guessing behavior and differential item functioning. Survey data on 184,869 individuals from 39 countries and territories is analyzed. Results show that when IRT is employed, a gender gap exists in only 54% of the sample. In contrast, when a conventional measurement approach is used, there is a gender gap in financial knowledge in 81% of the sample. These results reveal that prior measurements may underestimate women's financial knowledge and inflate the gender gap.

TI  - Is Income Inequality Influenced by Financial Knowledge? A Macroeconomic and Longitudinal Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB  - Our objective is to analyze whether financial knowledge influences income inequality. For this purpose, we resort to a new index of financial knowledge that differs from the existing ones in that it is both longitudinal and macroeconomic. We use this index as one of the explanatory variables of the Net Gini Index in our panel data estimations. Based on a sample of 63 countries over the period 2008-2014, our results allow us to conclude that financial knowledge is related to income inequality and that, moreover, this relationship is non-linear. Thus, increases in financial knowledge could reduce income inequality when starting from relatively low levels of such knowledge. However, at a certain threshold, the income redistributive effect of financial knowledge could disappear or even reverse. Even so, national strategies for financial education could be useful to achieve economic equity in those countries where financial knowledge levels are low. In addition, we shed light on the effect that other variables (such as institutional quality or under-education) have on income inequality.

TI  - THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL EDUCATION IN ADOLESCENT CONSUMERS' FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE ENHANCEMENT
T2  - MARKET-TRZISTE
AB  - Purpose - The aim of this paper was to challenge the purpose of financial education in the context of financial literacy of adolescents, and to test the efficiency of the developed high-school study book and program "My money, my future". Also, the purpose was to identify the predictors of financial knowledge before conducting the workshop, as well as the characteristics of adolescents with best performances on the financial knowledge test.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - The data was collected from a purposive sample of teenagers who participated in "My money, my future" program from October 2016 to February 2018 and the questionnaire employed was a three-part tool.
   Findings and implications - Financial interventions contribute to young people's financial knowledge. Interest, previous financial education and ownership of a bank account were found to be valid and reliable predictors of higher levels of knowledge among teenagers. Furthermore, most high school students in the sample reported they had already engaged in saving behaviour, and more than half of them claimed to have bank accounts. Financial knowledge after the workshop was significant compared to their knowledge before the workshop. Greater knowledge before the workshop led to significantly higher levels of knowledge afterwards. Differences in the levels of financial knowledge were also tested with respect to gender.
   Limitations - The sample only includes high- school students and the research was conducted exclusively on the territory of the Republic of Croatia.
   Originality - The paper emphasized the importance of financial education programs in increasing the level of financial literacy and efficiency of future financial decision making among adolescents.

TI  - Financial Knowledge Matters Entrepreneurial Decisions: A Survey in the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB  - Knowledge, general and specific, plays a role in entrepreneurship. Little is known about the role of general knowledge in entrepreneurial intentions. This study fills the gap by proposing financial knowledge as general knowledge and entrepreneurial education as specific knowledge, and investigates their effects on entrepreneurial intentions and the three motivational factors including attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Using survey data of 480 undergraduates and the structural equation modeling approach, we find a significant impact of financial knowledge on entrepreneurial intentions and all three motivational factors. Entrepreneurial education does not have a significant direct impact but has an indirect effect on entrepreneurial intentions through attitude and perceived behavioral control. These results are important to educators and policymakers to design appropriate policies to improve financial knowledge due to its significant role in entrepreneurial decisions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This exploratory study employed quasi-experimental research methods to investigate the relationship between adult participation in a comprehensive workplace financial education program and changes in financial knowledge levels. Results revealed a positive association between participation in the education program and changes in financial knowledge levels, even when controlling for demographic and socioeconomic differences between the participant and non-participant groups. However, results did not support an association between perfect attendance in the program and changes in financial knowledge. Evidence from this study provides meaningful insight into the association between adult financial education and financial knowledge and offers guidance for the future development of effective comprehensive workplace financial education programs.

TI  - Regional Comparative Analysis on the Determinants of the Spaniards' Financial Knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB  - Are there regional differences in the determinants of financial knowledge in the Spanish adult population? To answer this question, we use data from the Spanish Survey of Financial Competences to estimate qualitative response models in which each of the "big three" of financial knowledge (inflation, compound interest, and risk diversification) acts as a dependent variable on a set of explanatory variables concerning the particularities of individuals. We find that, while some factors determine financial knowledge in a generalized way in most regions and in the same direction (e.g., gender, education, self-confidence), others do so in different ways depending on the region analyzed. Among the latter are health status and financial fragility (where, in both, the different degree of social protection between regions may play an important role), as well as birthplace and age, among others. Rurality also stands out as having different implications in Navarra than in the rest of the regions. We conclude by proposing to use both longitudinal and aggregate indicators of financial knowledge in Spanish regions in order to analyze in the future related issues that are beyond the possibilities offered by microdata bases.

TI  - The Relationship Between Financial Knowledge, Investment Strategy and Satisfaction From Pension Schemes: Evidence From India
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - This study aims to examine antecedents of the pension schemes in Indian context. The relationship between the factors underlying the perception of subscribers towards the pension plan: financial knowledge, investment strategy, and satisfaction of investors (employees) is examined. Further, the effect of financial security, future financial goals, risk appetite, and secured returns on the investment strategy and satisfaction are explored. After checking the measurement properties of the structured survey instrument using the structural equation modeling with Lisrel package, data collected from 480 employees working in various administrative units of a State in the northern part of India, were analyzed. The Hayes's PROCESS was used in analyzing the moderated moderated-mediation complex model and the results reveal that (i) financial knowledge is positively related to (a) investment strategy, and (b) investor satisfaction. The investment strategy mediated the relationship between financial knowledge and employee satisfaction. Further, the results indicate that future financial goals (first moderator) and financial security (second moderator) moderated the relationship between financial knowledge and investor satisfaction mediated through investment strategy. The results also documented that risk appetite moderated the relationship between investment strategy and investor satisfaction; and secured returns moderated the relationship between financial knowledge and employee satisfaction. The novelty of this study stems from the three-way interaction between the financial knowledge, future financial goals, and financial security in influencing the financial strategy. The implications for research and practice are discussed.

TI  - Financial knowledge and responsible credit card behavior: exploring mediators and moderators
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeUnder the background of low consumer financial knowledge and accumulated credit card liabilities, this study investigates the relationship between financial knowledge and responsible credit card behavior using data from the 2019 China Household Finance Survey (CHFS). From the perspective of consumer economic well-being, this study defines accruing credit card debt to buy houses and cars when loans with lower interest rates are available as irresponsible credit card behavior.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses probit regressions to examine the association between financial knowledge and responsible credit card behavior because the dependent variable is a dummy variable. To alleviate endogeneity problems, this study uses instrument variables and Heckman's two-step estimation. Furthermore, to explore the potential mediators in this process, this study follows the stepwise regression method. Finally, this study introduces interaction terms to examine whether this association differs in different groups.FindingsThe results indicate that financial knowledge is conducive to increasing the probability of responsible credit card behavior. Mediating analyses reveal that the roles of financial knowledge occur by increasing the degree of concern for financial and economic information and the propensity to plan. Moderating analyses show that the effects of financial knowledge on responsible credit card behavior are stronger among risk-averse consumers and in regions with favorable digital access.Originality/valueThis study measures responsible credit card behavior from the perspective of the consumer's well-being, which enriches practical implications for consumer finance. Furthermore, this study explores the potential mediators influencing the process of financial knowledge that affects responsible credit card behavior and identifies moderators to conduct heterogeneous analyses, which helps comprehensively understand the nexus between financial knowledge and credit card behavior. By achieving these contributions, this study helps to curb the adverse effects of irresponsible credit card behavior on consumers' well-being and the economic system and helps policymakers promote financial knowledge to fully prevent irresponsible credit card behavior.

TI  - How Overconfident Financial Knowledge Hinders Retirement Planning? Mediating Analysis and Heterogeneity of Retirement Funding Sources
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - Under the background of general financial knowledge confidence and insufficient retirement planning, this study investigates the relationship between overconfident financial knowledge and consumer retirement planning. Using data from the National Financial Capability Study, this study employs probit regressions and finds that consumers with overconfident financial knowledge are less likely to have retirement planning, that is, contribute to retirement accounts regularly. This study further explores the mediators in this relationship and concludes that consumers who are overconfident in their financial knowledge tend to be more preference to risk, fail to make ends meet, and do not care about their financial situation, therefore are less likely to plan for retirement. Furthermore, compared to retirement accounts such as 401(k) that are through an employer, consumers with overconfident financial knowledge are more willing to engage in those such as IRA that are not through an employer. This study also finds that underconfident financial knowledge, another type of incorrect subjective evaluation of financial knowledge, is positively associated with retirement planning. Based on these findings, this study recommends policymakers reduce financial knowledge overconfidence, guide individuals to regularly pay attention to their financial situation, and encourage employers to actively participate in retirement plans.JEL Classification: D12, N30, D80, D91.
   Using data from the NFCS in 2012, 2015, 2018, and 2021, this study investigates the relationship between overconfident financial knowledge and retirement planning. This study finds that consumers who are overconfident in their financial knowledge are less likely to plan for retirement, namely not regularly contribute to a retirement account like a 401(k) or IRA. Mediating analyses reveal that consumers who are overconfident on their financial knowledge tend to be more preference to risk, fail to make ends meet, and do not care about their own financial situation, therefore are less likely to plan for retirement. This study also distinguishes the different types of retirement accounts and concludes that the negative relationship between overconfident financial knowledge and retirement planning is more significant in consumers that only engage in 401(k)-type (through an employer) compared to those only engage in IRA-type (not through an employer). Besides, this study also finds a positive relationship between underconfident financial knowledge and retirement planning.

TI  - Gender Differences in Financial Knowledge among College Students: Evidence from a Recent Multi-institutional Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - Women's disadvantage in financial knowledge impedes their progress toward gender equality and produces negative consequences for both individuals and households. To better understand the gender gap in financial knowledge and shed light on possible intervention strategies, this study focused on gender differences in financial knowledge specifically among college students. Drawing on data from the most recent administration of the Study on Collegiate Financial Wellness (SCFW; N = 18,107) among current college students from 38 public four-year institutions, we investigated the gender financial knowledge gap and paid particular attention to the roles of family financial socialization, financial education, and financial behaviors. We identified a sizable gender gap in financial knowledge, even after controlling for other potential factors. OLS regression models and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analyses showed that financial education-indicated by majoring in Business and STEM fields and formal financial courses in high school-was most related to the gender gap in financial knowledge scores. Hands-on financial behaviors were positively associated with financial knowledge acquisition, particularly for female students. In addition, the family socialization process was largely not associated with students' financial knowledge scores or the gender knowledge gap. Based on these findings, we discussed potential intervention strategies for promoting financial knowledge and reducing the gender gap among and beyond college students.

TI  - Adoption of students' loan schemes: the contingent role of financial knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Purpose - Despite the introduction of structural reforms to the students' loan scheme (SLS) in Ghana's higher education sector, patronage is still low. This paper aims to examine the complexity of technological and behavioural factors underpinning the low rate of students' loan adoption in Ghana. It further contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring the moderating role of financial knowledge in the hypothesized relationships.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a positivistic research approach, a sample of 700 tertiary students with experience in accessing STSs were surveyed. An 88% response rate was realized and the data analysed using descriptive statistics, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.
   Findings - Four dimensions of technological factors (relative advantage, trialability, observability and compatibility) and two of behavioural factors (attitude and control behaviour) were positively related to adoption of the SLS. Financial knowledge only moderated the relationship between compatibility, attitude, behavioural control and students' loan adoption.
   Practical implications - Financial knowledge plays a critical role in influencing the investment decisions of people. Management of SLSs needs to offer financial education to targeted parents/students to clear misconceptions. It is also imperative that all other technical challenges are addressed to enhance adoption rates for the SLS. Review of guarantor requirements is needed also.
   Originality/value - This paper introduces financial knowledge as a moderating variable to investigate the hypothesized relationships. It offers a developing country insight into how technological/behavioural factors and financial knowledge might be impacting adoption of SLSs.

TI  - Financial Knowledge and Short-Term and Long-Term Financial Behaviors of Millennials in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - This study investigates the role of financial knowledge in various short-term and long-term financial behaviors among Millennials in the United States. Results from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) indicate that Millennials have lower levels of objective financial knowledge and similar levels of perceived financial knowledge as compared to all households. Consistent multivariate results find financial knowledge to be positively associated with performing positive short-term and long-term financial behaviors. Results are found to be robust across different measurements of financial knowledge and behavior, and the issue of the potential for reverse causality is specifically addressed. This study provides a comprehensive financial profile of Millennials with important insight for policymakers as well as financial practitioners.

TI  - Informal financial education and consumer financial capability: The mediating role of financial knowledge
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - With the development of the economy, family wealth continues to accumulate, and more and more consumers participate in financial management affairs. As an important way to improve financial knowledge, informal financial education is vital to consumer financial capability. Utilizing data from the 2012, 2015, and 2018 US National Financial Capability Study and the approaches of ordinary least squares and ordered probit regression are employed to produce more accurate estimates. Meanwhile, the study also explores the mediating effects of financial knowledge between informal financial education and consumer financial capability. The results show that informal financial education has a positive effect on the improvement of consumer financial capability. Besides, financial knowledge partially mediates the nexus between informal financial education and consumer financial capability. Therefore, policymakers are encouraged to formulate measures to promote financial education programs not only in schools and universities but also in workplaces or communities. Companies also should offer more opportunities for their employees to receive financial education and further enhance their financial capability. Consumers should be aware of the importance of financial education and actively learn financial knowledge to improve financial capability and further enhance financial satisfaction.

TI  - Investigating the associations of consumer financial knowledge and financial behaviors of credit card use
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - The growing economic uncertainty makes consumers realize the importance of financial pre-paredness and management ability. Based on the U.S. National Financial Capability Study dataset from 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018, this study explores the nexus between consumer financial knowledge and financial behaviors of credit card use. The results indicate that financial knowl-edge positively affects consumer credit card ownership and desirable financial behaviors of credit card use, and is negatively related to undesirable credit card behaviors. The results are robust to different regression methods and after removing income outliers. The heterogeneity test shows that financial knowledge cannot enhance desirable credit card behaviors because of the income limitations in the low-income group. Therefore, there are implications for policymakers, financial sectors, and consumers to improve consumers' usage of credit cards and cultivate proper con-sumption habits by enhancing consumer financial knowledge.

TI  - Financial Knowledge and Private Health Insurance: Does Age Matter?
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - (1) Background: The paper focuses on the relationship between financial knowledge (FK) and holding private health insurance (PHI), and also focuses on the effect of age on the aforementioned relationship. (2) Method: The study was carried out on a sample of 8055 individuals taken from the 2016 Financial Competences Survey (the only one available), prepared by the Bank of Spain. Unlike previous studies that limited themselves to considering numeracy as a proxy for FK, in this study, two levels of FK-basic and advanced-are considered. (3) Results: The results indicate that a higher level of FK, specifically advanced FK, increases the probability of an individual holding PHI. Regarding age, it has been observed that the relationship between FK and PHI is only relevant in middle and older age, but not in younger and adults. Therefore, it is appropriate to differentiate between basic and advanced FK, and we confirm that age exerts a moderating effect on the influence of FK on PHI. (4) Conclusion: We conclude that FK-specifically, advanced FK for middle-aged and older people-is relevant to the likelihood of an individual holding PHI, which can improve health and financial wellbeing.

TI  - Effect of financial knowledge and information behavior on sustainable investments: evidence from India
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT
AB  - This study aims to explore the relationship between information behavior and sustainable investments in the Indian context. First, a conceptual model is developed and the relationship between information access and subjective financial knowledge and information behavior of investors. Then, after checking the psychometric properties of the survey instrument, data collected from 301 investors in the southern part of India was analyzed using structural equation modeling (Smart PLS software). The results indicate that (i) information access and subjective financial knowledge are positively associated with information behavior, (ii) information behavior is positively related to risk propensity, (iii) risk propensity and cognitive biases are positively related to sustainable investments, and (iv) risk propensity mediates the relationship between information behavior and sustainable investments. Finally, the implications for investors and practicing managers are discussed.

TI  - The Effect of Personal Finance Education on The Financial Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviour of University Students in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - There is much debate about the impact of personal finance education on financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, particularly based on studies in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (US). This paper makes a contribution to this debate, drawing on analysis of a survey of 521 undergraduate students at Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) in Indonesia in 2015. As part of that study, we measured the impact of a 14-week personal finance education course on financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. Our findings show that, when controlling for other factors, the personal finance course did, indeed, have a positive and statistically significant impact on financial knowledge. However, there was no statistically significant impact of the course on financial attitudes or behaviour. Our analysis also shows that family financial socialisation was an important driver of financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviour while other drivers of financial behaviour included income, work experience, year/field of study and discussing money with friends. We do not argue here that formal financial education is unimportant but that its role in changing attitudes and behaviour should be considered carefully if this is, indeed, its aim.

TI  - The influence of financial knowledge on the credit behaviour of small and micro enterprises: the knowledge-based view
T2  - JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The rich financial knowledge of small and micro business owners helps to enhance the formal credit demand of small and micro enterprises and change the credit channel preference of small and micro enterprises. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between financial knowledge and the credit practices of 290 small and micro enterprises in China's Jiangsu and Shandong provinces based on their formal credit needs and preferred channels of credit. Design/methodology/approach To measure the degree of the credit constraints of small and micro enterprises, this study applied questionnaire surveys to obtain information on the credit demand and supply of 363 small and micro enterprises in the Jiangsu and Shandong provinces. Firstly, a probit model is used to study the influence of financial knowledge on the formal credit demand and credit acquisition possibility of small and micro enterprises, and tool variables and a biprobit model are used to deal with the possible errors of endogenesis and sample selection. Secondly, a tobit model is used to study the influence of financial knowledge on the credit access of small and micro enterprises in different channels, and tool variables and a Heckman two-stage model are used to deal with endogenesis and possible errors in sample selection. Finally, this study carried out a series of robustness tests to make the conclusions more reliable. Findings This study is based on the perspective of the knowledge-based view to explore the impact of financial knowledge on the credit behaviour of small and micro enterprises. This study found that financial knowledge can increase a small and micro enterprise's formal credit needs and drive the small and micro enterprise to actively apply for loans. Furthermore, financial knowledge has a significant and positive influence on the acquisition of formal credit and approved lines of formal credit and a significant and negative influence on the acquisition of informal credit and approved lines of informal credit. Research limitations/implications The results indicated that increased financial knowledge can increase the likelihood of a small and micro enterprise to prefer formal credit and reduce the likelihood of it to prefer informal credit channels. Originality/value Financial knowledge is the ability to master basic economic knowledge and financial concepts as well as the ability to use knowledge to manage and allocate financial resources. The rich financial knowledge of small and micro business owners helps to enhance the formal credit demand of small and micro enterprises and change their credit channel preference. This paper offers a new perspective on the problems of credit constraint, low participation in formal credit markets and high participation in private credit markets among China's small and micro enterprises and valuably supplements the research literature.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - The present study seeks to determine the financial literacy level of Indian higher education students on the components of financial knowledge, attitude and behaviour. The paper also makes an attempt to study the interdependencies in financial literacy component: financial knowledge, attitude and behaviour and to assess the impact of financial awareness on financial literacy. This study considers primary source of data. A total sample of 600 Indian higher education students from different governmental and private institutions of Kanpur, Prayagraj and Aligarh was chosen to determine the financial literacy level. The findings of the study showed that more than half of the students were found to be low financial literate. There is a strong interrelationship found between the financial literacy components: financial knowledge, attitude and behaviour. In the linear regression analysis significant relationship found between the independent variable financial awareness and dependent variable financial literacy. The empirical findings of the study helps to explain how the financial literacy components: financial knowledge, attitude and behaviour influence the financial literacy level among the Indian higher education students. The result clearly showed that there is a need of serious policy measures to be taken in the field of financial literacy/education.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial socialisation experiences, socio-economic factors, demographic characteristics and the financial knowledge of first year undergraduate students. Design/methodology/approach Using a questionnaire, data were collected from a sample of 450 first year university students from both private and public universities. A multivariate regression method was adopted to examine the influence of financial socialisation among respondents of different ethnic groups and their social backgrounds on the individual's financial knowledge. Findings The findings indicate that: firstly, financial knowledge is low among first-year university students in Sarawak. Secondly, male respondents outperform female counterparts in terms of financial knowledge. Thirdly, parental financial socialisation remains the main source of financial knowledge among the students. Fourthly, there are significant differences in financial knowledge across ethnic groups. Research limitations/implications It is paramount to implement financial education programmes to elevate the financial literacy for both youth and parents since parents remain the primary source of financial socialisation for young adults. Practical implications The study suggests that financial knowledge varies according to gender and ethnicity. Hence, financial education programmes should be designed to accommodate the differences between groups based on ethnicity and gender to achieve the best outcome. Originality/value This is the first study that draws a representative sample of university students in Sarawak that examines the effects of ethnicity, gender and parental financial socialisation on financial knowledge among first year university students.

TI  - Role of financial knowledge, financial socialisation and financial risk attitude in financial satisfaction of Indian individuals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - The purpose of the present study is to examine the influence of financial knowledge and financial socialisation on financial satisfaction of an individual with financial risk attitude as a mediator with special focus on tier II city of India. The authors have adapted scales from literature on financial knowledge, financial socialisation, financial risk attitude and financial satisfaction to create a questionnaire. The mediated regression analysis was performed to test hypothesised relationships. Significant positive relationships were found between financial knowledge and financial satisfaction with financial risk attitude as mediator. Similarly, the relationship between financial socialisation and financial satisfaction with financial risk attitude as mediator were also found to be significantly positive. Financial risk attitude is observed to bear a mediating affect between financial knowledge and financial satisfaction, as also between financial socialisation and financial satisfaction. This research is an attempt to develop a framework for financial satisfaction in a developing country, aimed at the most vulnerable economic class. It is based on data from India, and the results have been found to be significant.

TI  - Does mobile payment use lead to overspending? The moderating role of financial knowledge
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AB  - Although consumers have increasingly adopted mobile payments as a new payment method, little academic attention has been given to the consequences of mobile payment use and whether the relationship may vary by individual factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether and how mobile payment use influences financial behaviors, particularly overspending behaviors. This study focuses on three aspects of overspending behaviors: consumption, money management, and credit card behaviors. Using a consumer sample (N = 21,457) from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), our results showed that mobile payment users are at a much higher risk of overspending than non-users. We further examined the moderating role of financial knowledge in the relationship and found that having more financial knowledge helps buffer the extent to which mobile payments exacerbate overconsumption and difficulty with money management. The findings contribute to the mobile payment literature by empirically examining the consequences of adopting a new payment method. The findings have practical implications for service providers in the mobile payment industry on how to design and develop interventions to reduce the unfavorable effects of mobile payment use among consumers.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - This study intends to investigate how aspects such as financial knowledge and the rate of technological advancement influence the lifetime of enterprises in developing nations like Pakistan. For this purpose, a survey study was designed to obtain data from 325 business owners in different parts of the country. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was utilized to analyze this dataset. According to the analysis outcomes, not only do practices connected to financial literacy and innovation play a crucial role in a firm's long-term viability, but they also have a substantial beneficial impact on the company's viability. The research concluded that an increase in financial knowledge, expertise, and experience in corporate operations helps the continued viability of firms. Knowledge of financial concerns also predicted the company's ability to innovate and adapt. In addition to the environmental sustainability of the business. As a result, it was concluded that it plays the role of a mediator in the link between innovation and the ongoing existence of businesses. Because of this, financial literacy is now acknowledged as a vital knowledge resource for determining one's financial course of action, which was not the case previously. According to the study's conclusions, for businesses to continue to be sustainable, authorities need to enhance their financial literacy level and adopt sustainability models into their day-to-day operations.

TI  - FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE FOR CORPORATE BOARDS: WHAT SHOULD BOARD MEMBERS KNOW?
T2  - INDEPENDENT JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT & PRODUCTION
AB  - Although there is a vast body of research on corporate governance and corporate boards, no one seems to have addressed yet the following question: What should corporate board members know of financial theory and practice to properly discharge their fiduciary responsibilities? The lack of reflection on this issue is somewhat surprising given the central role financial matters are supposed to play in board's discussions and decision making. The objective of this study is to offer a first reflection on this question. Different views of what a corporation is and who "owns" it, whether it is only shareholders or also a broader set of other stakeholders, result in different requirements concerning the financial knowledge board members should have. One such view is agency theory which considers that the main role of management is to create value for shareholders. From this perspective it will follow that board members should understand primarily the dynamics of value creation, with the concomitant focus on long-term strategy formulation. Another view is stakeholder theory which stresses the importance of the survival of the corporation. In this case the board should be conversant primarily with short term financial management, specially cash or liquidity management. The counterintuitive result is that when the board gives priority to the interests of shareholders, in opposition to the interests of other stakeholders beyond what law and good commercial and management practice recommends, it should focus primarily on long time value creation, while the more inclusive stakeholder view requires more attention on short-term cash management.

TI  - Subjective financial knowledge, prudent behaviour and income The predictors of financial well-being in Estonia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study how subjective and objective knowledge of finance, behaviour in managing personal finances and socio-economic status affect financial well-being.
   Design/methodology/approach - The financial well-being score is constructed in quantitative financial literacy survey data from Estonia as the arithmetic mean of four statements on a five-point scale. Four hypotheses are tested in multiple regression analysis.
   Findings - Subjective knowledge has a stronger relation with financial well-being than objective knowledge. Financial behaviour score and income level correlate with financial well-being.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper contributes to literature on financial literacy, subjective financial knowledge and financial well-being. In future research, psychological factors and future orientated financial well-being should be included, and their relationship to subjective well-being could be analysed further.
   Practical implications - The results highlight the importance of subjective knowledge and sound behaviour for improving financial well-being. Providers of financial services should address these more in the design of their services and communication.
   Social implications - Policymakers developing national strategies for financial education need to address subjective financial knowledge for increasing financial well-being in society.
   Originality/value - Knowledge, behaviour and subjective knowledge have not been used simultaneously in the analysis of financial well-being in Europe before.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR BUSINESS
AB  - This research aims to classify college students into meaningful groups based on their subjective financial knowledge (SFK), objective financial knowledge (OFK), and comparative financial knowledge (CFK) using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA). LPA captures underlying dynamics within the grouping variables and compares group differences. Results of LPA suggest three groups of college students in the sample, and the groups differed in levels of financial well-being (FWB), financial risk tolerance (FRT), and financial education experience (FEE).

TI  - Risk-Taking, Financial Knowledge, and Risky Investment Intention: Expanding Theory of Planned Behavior Using a Moderating-Mediating Model
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - This research examines the impact of financial knowledge on risky investment intention via the lens of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). The research developed a comprehensive model to test the mediation effect of the three TPB antecedents on the link between financial knowledge and risky investment intention. The research investigates the moderating effect of risk-taking on the link between three TPB constructs and risky investment intention. For these purposes, we used a pre-tested survey, was directed to senior university students in public universities in Saudi Arabia. The findings of SmartPLS showed a significant positive influence of financial knowledge on attitudes towards risky investment, subjective norms (SNs), and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Both SNs and PBC have a significant positive influence on risky investment intention. Nonetheless, the personal attitude of students failed to have a significant direct or mediating influence on risky investment intention. Additionally, risk-taking did not have a moderating effect on the link between personal attitude and risky investment intention. Students belong to a risk-adverse culture, which could justify the insignificant impact of their personal attitudes on risky investment intention. On the other side, SNs and PBC have a mediating effect on the link between financial knowledge and risky investment intention. Risk-taking has a moderating effect on the link between SNs, PBC, and risky investment intention. The research extends the use of TPB by validating its assumptions about driving the investment intention of university graduates.

TI  - Explanatory mechanisms of the decision to buy on credit: The role of materialism, impulsivity and financial knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate the mechanisms that explain why people choose to buy on credit. The individual characteristics of materialism, impulsivity and financial knowledge were analysed in order to better understand the relationship that exists between payment conditions and the decision to purchase on credit. Two experiments with a total sample of 409 respondents were conducted. Our analyses reveal that the offer of a discount for payment in cash has a negative effect on the propensity to buy on credit, regardless of whether interest was charged or not. Personal characteristics also play an important moderating role: individuals with high levels of materialism and impulsivity tend to buy on credit more. When the type of product is hedonic as opposed to utilitarian, there are larger variations in the average intention to buy on credit. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Financial Knowledge, Confidence, Credit Use, and Financial Satisfaction
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This article investigates associations between confidence about financial knowledge and two outcome variables, financial behaviors and financial satisfaction. On one hand, subjective financial knowledge (confidence) is necessary to make proactive decisions, yet overconfidence has been associated with a range of negative financial behaviors and outcomes. Both types of objective and subjective knowledge may be related to critical financial behaviors and choices such as credit card usage which in turn may be associated with financial satisfaction, an important component of consumer well-being. This article analyzes data from the 2015 National Financial Capability Study to examine how financial knowledge confidence relates to credit card behaviors and financial satisfaction. We use mediation and floodlight analyses to uncover relevant relationships between variables of interest. We find evidence that confidence is associated with healthy credit card use that contributes to financial satisfaction. We also observe strong interactions with knowledge to find that confidence is more strongly associated with credit card use and overall financial satisfaction as knowledge increases. Findings from this study can help financial educators and advisors to deliver the right mix of financial knowledge to better financial choices and behaviors.

TI  - Life insurance consumption across generations: The roles of financial knowledge, planning horizon, and self-control
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS
AB  - Life insurance enhances households' capacity to absorb financial shocks and protects against personal risks that no one likes to contemplate. This is even more important in times of economic hardship such as now, when many Europe countries and particularly Spain are going through difficult times due to rising inflation, the war in Ukraine, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although previous studies have analysed the driving forces of life insurance demand, the influence of the individual's financial planning horizon, financial knowledge, and financial self-control have been underexplored. This study analyses the influence of personal financial attributes on life insurance demand and, in so doing, explores whether the effects of such attitudes differ across different generational cohorts (i.e., the silent generation, baby boomers, Gen Xers, and millennials). The data, taken from the Survey of Financial Competences, comprises 7245 Spanish individuals. Evidence from multivariate analyses reflects the relevance of standard sociodemographic characteristics in explaining individuals' decisions to become life insurance holders. In contrast, evidence does not support a statistically significant relationship in the case of behavioural variables such as financial self-control and the financial planning horizon.

TI  - Gender, Education, and Financial Socialization as Determinants of Financial Knowledge: An Empirical Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The main aim of the paper is to assess the level of financial literacy among business students. It further aims to investigate the role of external factors that may determine financial literacy. The external factors considered in this study are gender, grade point average, specialization, financial education, and financial socialization. Standard scales such as the Test of Financial Literacy, the Big Three, and other instruments were adapted to measure Financial Knowledge. Further, the study also explored relationships between several factors and the financial knowledge of students. These factors included a student's gender, specialization, number of finance or related courses studied, current Grade Point Average, and financial socialization. A total number of 303 valid responses were received through an online questionnaire administered to business students studying in a public university in the country. Statistical tests namely independent samples t-Test, one-way ANOVA, and correlation analysis were performed in SPSS 28.0. Results show that the overall financial knowledge of students is above average. Gender, number of finance or related courses, and financial socialization do not exhibit any significant relationship with financial knowledge. Current GPA and specialization show significant relationships. The findings of this study have important sectoral and research implications.

TI  - Exploring the Interplay of Cognitive Style and Demographics in Consumers' Financial Knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Despite substantial research and advances in consumers' financial knowledge, many Americans still lack basic financial skills. One overlooked research area is the relationships between consumers' cognitive style and subjective knowledge and objective knowledge, and how these relationships vary by demographics. Based on a nationwide study (n = 817), results indicate that consumers' perception of their subjective financial knowledge varies by cognitive style, with those consumers having an intuitive cognitive style, having a higher perception of their subjective financial knowledge than those who are more analytical. More nuanced results suggest that subjective knowledge is related to the interplay of cognitive style with demographics, whereas objective knowledge is not dependent on this interplay. These and other results illustrate that understanding nuances of financial knowledge is still of pressing importance to ensure consumer well-being.

TI  - The role of learning motivation on financial knowledge among Vietnamese college students
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Using survey data from 730 undergraduates in Vietnam, we find that learning motivation and its components, especially self-efficacy, finance learning value, and achievement goals, significantly correlate with students' financial literacy performance. In addition, these correlations are moderated by student characteristics, among which academic seniority, university type, parents' education, and extra math study during high school matter the most. Our results raise significant implications to policymakers, researchers, and educators that include understanding the role of motivation and incorporating it in financial literacy education and intervention programs and considering the moderation roles that individuals' characteristics play in the motivation-financial literacy link. We encourage more research in these areas.

Many of these experiments are published in top economics and finance journals. The evidence shows that financial education programs have, on average, positive causal treatment effects on financial knowledge and downstream financial behaviors. Treatment effects are economically meaningful in size, similar to those realized by educational interventions in other domains, and robust to accounting for publication bias in the literature. We also discuss the cost-effectiveness of financial education interventions. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Financial knowledge and 401(k) investment performance: a case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - We explore whether investors who are more financially knowledgeable earn more on their retirement plan investments compared with their less sophisticated counterparts, using a unique new dataset linking administrative data on investment performance and financial knowledge. Results show that the most financially knowledgeable investors: (a) held 18% points more stock than their least knowledgeable counterparts; (b) could anticipate earning 8 basis points per month more in excess returns; (c) had 40% higher portfolio volatility; and (d) held portfolios with about 38% less idiosyncratic risk, as compared with their least savvy counterparts. Our results are qualitatively similar after controlling on observables as well as modeling sample selection. We also examine portfolio changes to assess the potential impact of the financial literacy intervention. Controlling on other factors, those who elected to take the financial literacy survey boosted their equity allocations by 66 basis points and their monthly expected excess returns rose by 2.3 basis points; no significant difference in volatility or non-systematic risk was detected before versus after the survey. While these findings relate to only one firm, we anticipate that they may spur other efforts to enhance financial knowledge in the workplace.

AB  - We examine the impact of female-led venture firms' knowledge of alternative forms of financial capital and its effect on their financial performance as compared to male-led ventures. We contend that women chief executive officers (CEOs) leading such ventures faced unique historical and stereotypical challenges that impeded their financial knowledge and subsequent firm performance. We utilize liberal and social feminism frameworks, complemented with homophily theory to illustrate how female CEOs can overcome these challenges by increasing the percentage of women in the ownership structure of female-led venture firms.

T2  - BENCHMARKING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - PurposeThe present study aims to investigate the effects of sector 4.0 technologies, particularly Financial Technology (Fintech), on Sustainable Business Success (SBS) within the Indian garment sector. It aims to analyse the impact of Fintech Integration (IF) and Extent of Financial Knowledge (EFK) on sustainability performance, with a focus on understanding the mediating effect of Financial Accessibility (FA) in this relationship.Design/methodology/approachThe study utilizes covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) to analyse data collected from 683 enterprises in the Indian garment sector. The theoretical frameworks of Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT) and the Resource-Based View are employed to guide the research.FindingsThe investigation reveals that Fintech Integration (IF) and environmental friendliness knowledge significantly impact the promotion and maintenance of sustainability within the Indian garment sector. Moreover, the study highlights the moderating influence of financial Accessibility (FA) on the associations among fintech integration, Extent of Financial Knowledge, and sustainability attainment. Furthermore, sensitivity studies demonstrate that improved financial access positively affects a firm's sustainability performance.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the existing literature by addressing significant knowledge gaps and offering practical insights for managers and policymakers in the Ready-Made Garments (RMG) industry. It provides a comprehensive approach that integrates fintech and financial expertise to enhance credit accessibility and foster long-term viability for enterprises within the Indian garment sector. The originality lies in its holistic perspective, combining technological integration with the Extent of Financial Knowledge to drive sustainability in a specific industrial context, thus providing valuable guidance for industry stakeholders.

TI  - Islamic finance in global markets: Materialism, ideas and the construction of financial knowledge
T2  - REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB  - In light of the dramatic expansion Islamic finance (IF) has experienced over the past few decades, the industry has received increasing attention, not only within Muslim economies, but all around the world, as illustrated by the involvement of numerous non-Muslim public and private institutions. As the Islamic financial movement is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon, this paper critically examines the 'materialist'-led contributions in the social sciences (especially in economics and finance) on the rise of this alternative set of practices and ideas. In doing so, social constructivism is introduced as a fertile intellectual framework to complement the current debates on this topic. At the end of this paper, three new perspectives on IF are distilled from the latter's encounter with social constructivism. These reside in (1) providing an alternative epistemological position on the encounter between conventional and Islamic financial knowledge; (2) highlighting the presence of structures of authority in the emergence of financial alternatives such as IF; and (3) emphasizing the role of key economic agents/institutions in the global diffusion of Islamic financial ideas.

TI  - Sharia Financial Knowledge And Financial Behavior As A Basis For Measuring Financial Literacy
T2  - QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB  - Our daily life is inseparable from financial problems. Problems in finances are more often caused by errors in management, as well as errors in distinguishing between needs and wants. One of the reasons for the number of poor people in Medan City is their lack of ability to manage their finances to meet their daily needs. The level of public financial literacy will also provide benefits to the financial sector, especially those directly related to the public's contribution to the use of financial products and services. The conventional financial system approach is very different from the Islamic financial system or what is commonly referred to as Islamic finance. This study aims to analyze the level of knowledge of Islamic finance, and financial behavior, and also analyze the effect of knowledge of Islamic finance on financial behavior and the level of Islamic financial literacy of members of the Muhammadiyah organization in Medan City. This type of research is quantitative research with the method of deduction. Research is included in the type of correlational research. Data The population in this study is a large Muhammadiyah family in the city of Medan with the sampling process using the purposive sampling method. Data sourced from respondents was obtained through questionnaires. This research uses SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) analysis tool. The results showed that in general the level of Islamic financial knowledge of Muhammadiyah members was low, but financial behavior was good. The behavior and knowledge of members ' Islamic finance show a positive and significant correlation. At the literacy level, the results show that members of the Muhammadiyah organization are generally classified as less literate.

TI  - Examining Antecedents of Health Insurance Literacy: The Role of Locus of Control, Cognitive Style, and Financial Knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Today's consumer is expected to make health-care decisions that have serious implications for their welfare. However, a major barrier to these decisions is a basic lack of understanding of health insurance. A critical first step is to examine drivers of health insurance literacy and in turn offer interventions that can have a positive impact on consumer welfare. This article explores the relationship between relevant consumer psychographics, financial knowledge, and demographics with health insurance literacy. Results indicate that while demographics play a role, the degree to which consumers believe a situation or event is under their own control (i.e., locus of control), how they process information (i.e., cognitive style), and consumer's financial confidence (i.e., subjective knowledge) is a critical indicator of their health insurance literacy. Cluster analysis reveals three "faces" of health insurance literacy.

TI  - Entrepreneurs on their financial literacy: evidence from the Netherlands
T2  - VENTURE CAPITAL
AB  - Using a representative survey of Dutch entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals, (i) we measure their subjective financial knowledge and the extent to which they ask for advice when managing their companies, and (ii) we examine whether subjective financial knowledge and the demand for advice are related to the firm economic performance. We find that the respondents feel more comfortable with accounting subjects than they do with strategic ones, of which they feel that they know the least. Entrepreneurs with a greater extent of financial knowledge are more likely to report a higher gross margin and higher revenue growth for their firm. These entrepreneurs are also less likely to seek advice and to delegate financial decisions. Seeking professional advice does not increase the likelihood of an entrepreneur having better performance. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs' degree of financial knowledge is related to the success of their businesses, while seeking advice is not significantly correlated with better firm performance.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between financial literacy and long- and short-term financial behaviors by age group for those without a college degree. Financial literacy was measured and discussed in the context of three components: objective financial knowledge, confidence in financial knowledge, and financial ability. Financial ability was significant in each age group and had the highest odds ratios of the three components of the financial literacy construct for the short-term index. Both confidence in financial knowledge and financial ability were significant in each age group for budgeting while objective financial knowledge was not. The results suggest that confidence in both knowledge and ability are important influences on positive financial behaviors for those without a college degree.

   This research applied two quantitative studies with customers of banks in a Latin American country. The literature review and the results of the data analysis founded the development of a model that relates bank information transparency and subjective financial well-being through consumer financial knowledge.
   Findings
   By being transparent banks may transform the financial well-being of their customers. Particularly, this paper shows that consumer financial knowledge mediates the relationship between bank information transparency and the subjective financial well-being of individuals. However, the mediational effect occurs by subjective but not objective financial knowledge.
   Research limitations/implications
   The mediational model of this research does not take in consideration the role that individual factors play in the exposition and processing of the information provided by banks and its final impact on the subjective well-being of individuals. Also, this paper does not explore potential moderators of the theoretical relationships neither include cultural variables in the analysis.
   Originality/value
   Firm transparency has been related to various constructs in the marketing literature; however, its impact on consumer financial well-being is under-researched. This paper shows that companies need to aim to increase the subjective financial knowledge of their customers as a way to improve ultimate well-being of their customers.

TI  - Financial Education Effects on Financial Behavior and Well-Being: The Mediating Roles of Improved Objective and Subjective Financial Knowledge and Parallels in Physical Health
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING
AB  - How does financial education lead to improved financial behavior and higher financial well-being? An influential Consumer Financial Protection Bureau model introduced in 2015 proposes that the goal of financial education is to improve financial well-being and that financial education does so by increasing financial knowledge, which improves financial behavior, which improves financial well-being. In this study, the authors test links in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau model, examining the differential roles of objective and subjective knowledge. They also test whether an analogous model might capture effects of physical health education on physical health knowledge, behavior, and well-being. They report a quasi-experiment comparing changes in financial and physical health knowledge, behavior, and well-being at two time points in a semester for students enrolled in a personal finance class, a personal health class, or neither. This study reports the first causal estimates of flow from financial education to financial knowledge to financial behaviors to a validated measure of subjective financial well-being. Financial education caused large changes in both objective and subjective knowledge. Yet only subjective knowledge mediated the large effects of financial education on changes in downstream behaviors. The authors find weaker but similar results for physical health. The findings suggest that financial education efforts should be refocused to foster subjective knowledge and improved behavior.

TI  - Financial Literacy in Malaysia, 2015-2018
T2  - MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the state of financial literacy of Malaysians using data from the OECD (INFE) Financial Literacy Survey conducted in the year 2015 and 2018. Besides the three components of financial literacy, namely, financial knowledge, financial attitude and financial behaviour, this paper also analyses the financial vulnerability of individuals. The effects of socio-demographic factors excluding gender are significant in determining financial literacy levels. Generally, Malaysians do not think that they have high financial knowledge, and the objective financial knowledge assessment reflects this as less than 40% of the respondents meet the minimum financial knowledge target score. There are no significant differences in the level of financial knowledge between 2015 and 2018 but financial attitude towards money usage has worsened in 2018 when compared to 2015. However, in terms of financial behaviour, Malaysians are generally active savers, set long-term financial goals, make considered and informed purchases, and keep a close watch on their personal affairs. Malaysians are financially vulnerable, but they seem more prepared in weathering the storm and having financial cushions for emergencies in 2018 compared to 2015. The findings suggest that more effort is needed in educating Malaysians on fundamental financial concepts and ways to enhance their financial cushion.

TI  - Compulsive Buying Behaviour of Credit Card Users and Affecting Factors Such as Financial Knowledge, Prestige and Retention Time: A Cross-sectional Research
T2  - VISION-THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
AB  - A leading concern in client and vender relations is that the rising new situation of influence deploying of the credit card market. This situation is accountable for compulsive buying, which has disapprovingly exaggerated consumers, leading to impossible debt levels. Financial counsellors search for why and how individuals get themselves into financial debt. Compulsive buying behaviour and credit card could have a powerful effect on consumers' financial stability. Further, in place of comprehending credit card usage and compulsive buying, this study correlates them with wealth attitudes such as power-prestige, financial knowledge and retention time. A cross-sectional descriptive research design using convenience sampling and non-probability sampling with quota samples of 313 credit cardholders was surveyed. The outcome showed that those with power-prestige money attitudes are likely to have free usage of credit cards through compulsive spending. Results also showed that those with a higher financial understanding have lower compulsive spending off the credit card.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT & APPLIED SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - This study assesses the impact of financial education on financial capability (literacy) of young adults in Punjab, Pakistan. Combination of objective financial knowledge, financial attitudes and financial behaviors constructed financial capability. Results indicate that business students are more financially capable than non-business students. The result of the study reveals that Master's degree level education in finance has significant positive impact on financial capability as compared with study of finance in other education levels. The financial education index has highly significant positive impact on financial knowledge, financial attitudes and financial capability index. However, financial education does not improve the financial behaviors of young adults. Moreover, the results also revealed that degree in finance has positive association with financial capability.

TI  - Entrepreneurial Awareness and Entrepreneurial Intention: Understanding the Role of Family and School
T2  - STUDIES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMICS
AB  - This study aims to examine the factors that affect entrepreneurial awareness and intention in Junior High School students This research used a quantitative approach with PLS-SEM by considering that the model employed unobserved variables and measured using different scale. This research applied convenience sampling and obtained 97 Junior High School students spread across Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi (the Greater Jakarta) as the research samples. Furthermore, this research proved that entrepreneurial awareness and self-efficacy significantly affected entrepreneurial intention. On the other hand, entrepreneurship education, financial knowledge, and entrepreneurship experience did not significantly affect entrepreneurial intention. Meanwhile, entrepreneurial awareness was influenced by financial knowledge. The results proved that financial knowledge mediated the effects of financial socialization on entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial awareness. Meanwhile, financial knowledge had some effects on entrepreneurial intention through entrepreneurial awareness. The empirical results emphasized the importance of the role of families and schools in building entrepreneurial awareness and intention.

TI  - The Value of Financial Education During Multiple Life Stages
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - This study examines the timing of financial education and its impact on short-term and long-term financial behavior. We also explore the power of financial education on financial knowledge and examine the link between financial knowledge and positive financial behavior. Exposure to financial education during multiple life stages leads to a better financial outcome. Financial education taught via multiple channels, including high school, college, the workplace, and at home, is the most optimal in the long run. For those who did not attend college, being exposed to financial education in high school is significantly associated with positive financial behavior. We cite implications for all financial education advocates. Policymakers in the financial capability arena can stay abreast of the channels of financial education that produce the most fruitful economic and societal gains.

TI  - Financial Literacy among the Millennial Generation: Relationships between Knowledge, Skills, Attitude, and Behavior
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - This study aims to determine the level of financial literacy among the millennial generation and to examine the correlation of their financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial skills with their financial behavior. Multiple choice questions were used to measure financial knowledge with results grouped into three categories: low, moderate, and high. Financial attitude, financial skills, and financial behavior were also grouped using the quartile method into three categories: poor, fair, and good. Chi-squared analysis was used to test the hypotheses, with correspondence analysis conducted to identify the characteristics of the millennial generation and to graphically illustrate the gap. Regarding financial attitude, financial skills, and financial behavior, the proportions of respondents in the 'fair' category, were 70.6%, 66.5%, and 72.2%, respectively. Significant relationships were found not only between financial attitude and financial management behavior, but also between financial skills and financial management behavior. However, the relationship was not significant between financial knowledge and financial behavior.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThe study investigated the relationship between future time perspective and financial well-being among Chinese working millennials and its serial mediators, such as financial goal clarity, subjective financial knowledge and responsible financial behaviour, to foster consumer resilience in the financial realm.Design/methodology/approachA total of 526 Chinese working millennials (Mage = 31.78) participated in the online survey in response to questions on demographic characteristics and items to measure the variables adopted in the research model. Covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) and AMOS version 27 were used to test the research hypotheses.FindingsThe results revealed a positive correlation between future time perspective and financial well-being. Moreover, the results showed that financial goal clarity, subjective financial knowledge and responsible financial behaviour serially mediated the correlation between future time perspective and financial well-being.Practical implicationsThe findings provide implications for companies and policymakers to refine their intervention programmes to boost young millennials' future time perspectives in reinforcing their financial knowledge and financial goal clarity which in turn fosters their responsible financial behaviour in contributing to financial well-being in boosting their overall consumer resilience. Future studies should deepen the way in which the studied factors are leveraged as a tool to improve individuals' resilience in the economic realm.Originality/valueThe findings of this study shed light on the underlying mechanisms that drive and promote the financial well-being of Chinese working millennials.

TI  - INVESTOR BEHAVIOUR AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS: EVIDENCE FROM PAKISTAN STOCK EXCHANGE
T2  - ASIAN ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - This research aims to understand the influence of behavioural factors on investment decisions in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). This study gathered primary data using a survey-based questionnaire from 318 individual investors. The issue being investigated in this study is how behavioural elements, such as sentiment, overconfidence, over-and under -reaction, and perceived market efficiency, affect investment choices made on the PSX, with a particular emphasis on the limited predictive power of herd behaviour. The sample data were analysed using partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) based approach. Results indicate that financial knowledge, sentiment, overconfidence, over-and under-reaction, and perceived market efficiency significantly affect the investment decision. Interestingly, herd behaviour does not play a significant role in predicting investment decisions. However, we are certain that this study will provide a better understanding of the relationship between behavioural factors and an investor's investment decision in Pakistan.

TI  - Personal finance behaviour: a reasoned action approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose This study sought to examine the impact of financial knowledge, financial attitude, locus of control and income on financial behaviour. Design/methodology/approach The study employed the reasoned action approach framework by Fishbein and Ajzen (2010), with formal sector workers in three districts of Ghana as the population. Questionnaires were used to collect data and analysed using partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). Findings The results of the study revealed that perceived financial knowledge, financial attitude and locus of control had a significant positive relationship with financial behaviour intention. The assertion that actual financial knowledge and income influence actual financial behaviour was not supported by the findings. However, income moderated significantly the intention-actual financial behaviour relationship. Practical implications The findings imply that having financial knowledge or earning a higher income in itself does not guarantee the good financial behaviour of people. It is recommended that financial education must focus on developing good financial attitudes and beliefs to enhance the needed behavioural change. Originality/value To the best of the researcher's knowledge, there is no study of financial behaviour that adopts the methodology and variables used in this research in Ghana.

TI  - Influence of Financial Literacy and Educational Skills on Entrepreneurial Intent: Empirical Evidence from Young Entrepreneurs of Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This paper attempts to study the impact of Financial Literacy on Youth Entrepreneurial Intent in Pakistan. A closed-ended self-administered structured questionnaire covering financial literacy, computer knowledge, financial attitude, and financial knowledge with Entrepreneurial Intent was collected from young entrepreneurs. The research tried to investigate the education level with computer skill to inspect the effect of financial literateness on young generation Entrepreneurial Intent in the context of Pakistan. The research model was tested using PLS-SEM and authenticating a measurement model through the advanced methodology and their association with Entrepreneurial Intent. Results revealed that financial literacy and its two parts (financial attitude and financial knowledge) have a positive impact on Entrepreneurial Intent. The size of the joint impact of financial literacy and its components on Entrepreneurial Intent was assessed to be adequate. Entrepreneurial Intent is essential for creating new firms to maintain economic development. Furthermore, it is determined in this research that if youth has better financial knowledge and financial attitude, the probability of Entrepreneurial Intent increases. This suggests that if the youth in Pakistan desire to attain a higher limit of Entrepreneurial Intent, they must implement financial literacy models for enhancing and promoting their current Entrepreneurial Intent.

TI  - The roles of peers and social media in building financial literacy among the millennial generation: A case of indonesian economics and business students
T2  - COGENT SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB  - Students of the millennial generation have several characteristics, including being wasteful in their management of money and being highly dependent on information and communication technology. These phenomena mean financial literacy is important for them, in order that they become capable, wise, and efficient individuals who are future-oriented in managing their personal finances. This study aims to create a model for developing the financial management behavior of students. It covers five variables, namely financial behavior, financial attitude, financial knowledge, social media exposure, and peer influence. By using purposive sampling and a five-point Likert scale questionnaire, this study collected data from 327 students spread across several universities in Indonesia. The results of the descriptive analysis show that the students' financial management behavior (FMB), financial attitude, and financial knowledge are classified as good. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis using the single-composite indicator technique shows that 58% of FMB is influenced by financial exposure from social media, financial attitude, and peer influence. Social media exposure and peer influence take on a strategic nature. Financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial behavior are internal variables related to financial literacy. Further research would need to identify the external variables that have a potential influence on the internal variables of financial literacy.

TI  - Effect of parental financial teaching on college students' financial attitude and behavior: The mediating role of self-esteem
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - This study investigated the effect of parental financial teaching on college students' financial attitude and behavior and the mediating roles of college students' self-esteem and financial knowledge within these re-lationships. An online survey including questions on demographics, parental financial teaching, self-esteem, financial knowledge, attitude, and behavior was given to a sample of 193 undergraduate and graduate stu-dents at a Midwestern university in the U.S. A model consisting of nine hypotheses reflecting these relationships was established and tested by structural equation modeling. The results revealed that parental financial teaching positively affected financial behavior both directly and indirectly through self-esteem and financial attitude. Most importantly, self-esteem played a mediating role in connecting parental financial teaching to students' financial attitude and behavior, whereas financial knowledge did not play any role. Consequently, this study found that parents' financial teaching positively influences their children's financial attitude and behavior by increasing their self-esteem.

TI  - The impact of financial literacy on negotiation behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB  - This research investigates the role of financial literacy on initiating and achieving a favorable negotiation outcome in an employment context. With a goal of improving long-term financial well-being, extant research examines whether increasing a person's understanding of basic financial concepts ("financial literacy") improves his/her financial decision-making. The current research proposes broader effects of financial literacy via negotiation behavior. We follow prior research to measure financial literacy both objectively (as the accurate assessment of basic financial concepts, "financial knowledge") and subjectively (as confidence in the application of basic financial skills and concepts, "financial confidence"). In a series of studies engaging students from undergraduate business courses and adults recruited from an online crowdsourcing service, this research examines the relationship between these measures of financial literacy and (a) the likelihood of initiating a negotiation and (b) the likely outcome from a negotiation, if initiated. Results suggest that financial confidence impacts participants' willingness to engage in negotiation, while financial knowledge impacts the level of participants' first offer. These findings suggest financial literacy has important implications for career advancement and compensation, as well as the successful management of interpersonal communications, even in fields not traditionally thought of as focusing on numerical reasoning skills.

TI  - Financial literacy and fraud detection*
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - Who is better at detecting fraud? This paper finds that more financially knowledgeable individuals have a higher propensity to detect fraud: a one standard deviation increase in financial knowledge increases fraud detection probabilities by 3 percentage points. The result is not driven by individuals' higher financial product usage and is observed to be moderated by individuals' low subjective well-being, effectively depleting skills to detect fraud. Interestingly, prudent financial behavior relating to basic money management is found to have negligible effects for detecting fraud. The findings attest to the fact that fraud tactics are increasingly complex and it is greater financial knowledge rather than basic money management skills that provide the degree of sophistication necessary to detect fraud. The paper draws policy implications for consumer education programs to go beyond cultivating money management skills, and provide advanced financial knowledge necessary for tackling fraud.

TI  - The relationship between migration background and knowledge and understanding of personal finance of young adults in Germany
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION
AB  - Financial knowledge and understanding is needed to function well in society; however, young people with a migration background in Germany have been found to perform worse on tests of financial knowledge than those without. Very little investigation has been made into the relationship between financial knowledge and language ability, and ostensibly no in-depth investigation has been made into the connection between frequency of use of the local language and how it correlates to performance on such tests. In this paper we examine the relationship between migration background and knowledge and understanding of personal finance of young adults in Germany. We administered a validated German version of the Council for Economic Education's Test of Financial Literacy to 1037 individuals between the ages of 17 and 25 and controlled not only for migration background but also for frequency of German language use. In line with results of previous studies, we found participants with a migration background generally had less financial knowledge than those with no migration background. More specifically, migrants who spoke predominantly a language other than German at home demonstrated less financial knowledge than those who spoke German at home with their families. Thus, it is not migration background per se, but rather more obscure variables related to migration background that may influence performance on such tests of financial knowledge.

TI  - Determinants of Subjective Financial Well-Being Across Three Different Household Income Groups in Malaysia
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - Macro level economic and social indicators indicate disengagements between objective measurements and subjective consumer perceptions of the Malaysian economy. Objective measures show positive signals while subjective consumer perceptions depict pessimistic feelings about the economy. To provide more insights on this disparity, data is collected from 1867 Malaysian households to assess their subjective financial well-being (SFWB). In this vein, this study first examines the level of SFWB, financial stress, financial behaviour, financial knowledge, and locus of control (LOC) among Malaysians across three household income groups. Second, the study examines the association between financial stress, financial behaviour, financial knowledge, and LOC, with SFWB. For both objectives, the sample is split into three household income groups (low, middle and high income households, or the B40, M40 and T20, respectively) to analyse the differences. The results show that SFWB is at an average level of 5.2 out of 10 for the overall sample, with significant differences observed between the B40, M40 and T20 groups with SFWB scores of 4.3, 5.1 and 6.2 respectively. Financial behaviour and LOC have a significant positive relationship with SFWB, while financial stress and financial knowledge have a significant negative relationship with SFWB across all households. However, among the B40 group, financial knowledge had no significant relationship with SFWB. Lastly, the findings are discussed and policy recommendations for policymakers are provided.

TI  - Financial literacy environment scan in Mozambique
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - This research aims to scan financial literacy in Mozambique, assessing its levels and identifying the sociodemographic factors that influence it, generalizing to the developing countries. Quantitative research was performed using a survey database of 3,875 respondents collected in Mozambique. Our results document that more than 61% of the respondents did not answer correctly the questions regarding financial literacy, which indicates that the levels of financial literacy in Mozambique are low. Individuals are not qualified to make the most appropriate financial decisions and end up compromising their financial well-being. It was also found that age impacts respondents' financial knowledge, gender influences financial behavior, educational level influences financial knowledge and behavior, and the training area influences financial knowledge, attitude, and behavior. This article contributes by providing information regarding the financial literacy of Mozambique, which is still scarce and providing a sci-entific basis for decision-makers to improve public policies regarding financial literacy.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Investigating the financial overconfidence of student-athletes
T2  - SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose There is a paucity of empirical research that explores the financial well-being of collegiate student-athletes. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the key aspects of financial well-being (e.g. financial knowledge, financial self-efficacy and finance-related stress levels) of varsity athletes at US colleges and universities. Design/methodology/approach The authors used data from the National Student Financial Wellness Study. The data were analyzed using general linear regression models. Findings The findings suggest student-athletes have lower financial knowledge than students who are non-athletes. Despite their lower levels of financial knowledge, these student-athletes report higher levels of financial self-efficacy. Furthermore, even when controlling for scholarship funding, student-athletes reported lower levels of financial stress than their counterparts. One could interpret this as student-athletes having a false sense of confidence in their money management behaviors. This overconfidence can impact many areas of their overall financial well-being. Alternatively, non-athletes may not be as financially confident as they should be. Research limitations/implications This study could be replicated with stronger measures (e.g. Financial Self-Efficacy Scale), with the inclusion of subjective financial knowledge measures, comparing the impact of demographic variables. As, most financial constructs have gender differences (Farrellet al., 2016) and race differences (Amatucci and Crawley, 2011) and depend upon college major (Fosnacht and Calderone, 2017). Another limitation of this study is the small percentage of student-athletes, a common problem with research in this area. Further research is also needed to unpack the finding that self-efficacy decreases at higher levels of financial knowledge. Practical implications It is evident that college students (athletes/non-athletes) need financial education. For universities and college coaches, this study could be used as a rationale for providing financial education for their athletes. The addition of financial courses could be used as a recruiting tool for collegiate coaches and benefit the university. Requiring financial education could also benefit universities long term as it may potentially increase the donor possibilities by alumni. As a final note, it is important that financial courses figure out ways to improve financial self-efficacy alongside financial knowledge, as findings suggest both are integral to decreasing financial stress. Social implications Less than 4 percent of universities in the USA require students to take a personal finance course (Bledsoeet al., 2016). If more universities included personal finance as a graduation requirement and did more to engage student-athletes (and non-athletes) in financial planning, then the average level of financial knowledge would likely improve on campuses across the USA. In addition, increasing young adults financial self-efficacy could improve financial stress which is linked to mental health and physical health. Originality/value This study provides the first empirical look into the financial well-being of collegiate student-athletes across the USA. Although there are many benefits to participation in college sports, student-athletes face additional time pressures and a predisposition to clustering around certain majors. Findings suggest that collegiate athletes need additional support around their financial literacy and non-athletes may need support developing financial self-efficacy.
   These two findings should be used by academic institutions and athletic departments to determine how to encourage financial health in their student-athletes and general student body.

TI  - Empirical investigation of the Fintech and financial literacy nexus: Small business managers' insights in Cameroon
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Recent and ongoing advancements in the field of ICT have led to the introduction of increasingly diversified financial products, and their use is improving people's level of financial knowledge and skills. This article aims at assessing the effect of Fintech on the level of financial literacy of small business' managers in Cameroon. To this end, information was gathered using a questionnaire from 209 small business managers in Cameroon. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), and multiple linear regression are used. Results lead to two main conclusions. On the one hand, unlike knowledge of their existence, the frequency of use of Fintech tools is better able to contribute to improving financial literacy levels overall. On the other hand, specifically, this result is of increased importance when it comes to competence and self-confidence in managing financial affairs. As a result, increasing the utilization of financial technology instruments in companies is imperative for efficiency.

TI  - How does financial literacy influence undergraduates' risk-taking propensity?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
AB  - Previous evidence is contradictory about the financial literacy-individual's risk-taking propensity relationship. Therefore, this article attempts to examine the relationship between financial literacy and risk-taking propensity in a university environment, considering for the first time the financial literacy's multidimensional nature (i.e., financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial behaviour). Applying Covariance-Based Structural Equation Models to 568 Spanish undergraduates, our results show that: (1) financial knowledge and financial behaviour directly and positively affect risk-taking propensity; (2) financial attitude indirectly and positively affects risk-taking propensity through financial behaviour. These findings are relevant since they provide new insights into the association mechanism that explains the financial literacy-undergraduates' risk-taking propensity relationship.

TI  - Mediating Effect of Financial Behaviour on the Relationship Between Perceived Financial Wellbeing and Its Factors Among Low-Income Young Adults in Malaysia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The main objective of this study is to investigate the associations between financial knowledge, locus of control (LOC) and perceived financial wellbeing (FWB) with financial behaviour as a mediator among young adults from low-income households in Malaysia, controlling for education and income. The sample of this study consisted of 482 young adults from five different zones in Peninsular and East Malaysia, which were selected using a multi-stage sampling technique. Data were collected using a set of questionnaire-based surveys. The data were then analysed using Covariance Based Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The study found that financial knowledge and external LOC as well as financial behaviour were significantly correlated with the perceived FWB of low-income young adults in Malaysia. The results also revealed that financial behaviour mediates the influence by financial knowledge and internal LOC on perceived FWB controlling for education and income. The findings of this study provide insights into the factors of perceived FWB of low-income young adults in Peninsular and East Malaysia. Policymakers, government and non-government organisations may utilise this study to develop new policies, financial programmes or campaigns to enhance the FWB of low-income young adults in Malaysia.

TI  - Financial Literacy, Savings Culture and Millennials Students Behavior Towards Retirement
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The objective of this work is to know, based on gender, the level of financial literacy of millennials students in the city of Veracruz; whether they have a savings culture and their behavior regarding retirement savings. For this, the descriptive cross-sectioned method was used, with a sample of 120 millennials students from Veracruz between 17 and 40 years of age. The data was obtained from an electronic survey applied through WhatsApp and Facebook. The instrument used was designed with items taken from surveys by Lusardi and Mitchell (2014), CONSAR+ (2017), Banamex (2014) and Banamex-UNAM (2008). Subsequently, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to test the reliability of the instrument. The main findings are that this group has basic financial knowledge, however, not enough to handle more complex financial products such as bonds. In terms of gender, it is men who have a higher level of financial literacy, while it is women who have a greater culture of saving and are more aware of the importance of saving for retirement.

TI  - Do Incentives Matter for the Diffusion of Financial Knowledge? Experimental Evidence from Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN ECONOMIES
AB  - Many development interventions involve training of beneficiaries, based on the assumption that knowledge and skills will spread 'automatically' among a wider target population. However, diffusion of knowledge or innovations can be slow and incomplete. We use a randomised field experiment in Uganda to assess the impact of providing incentives for knowledge diffusion, and pay trained individuals a fee if they share knowledge obtained during a financial literacy training. Our main results are that incentives increase knowledge sharing, and that it may be cost-effective to provide such incentives. We also document an absence of assortative matching in the social learning process.

TI  - MEASURING ISLAMIC FINANCIAL LITERACY AND DISCOVERING ITS RELATIONS WITH ENTREPRENEURSHIP AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN TURKEY
T2  - BILIMNAME
AB  - Financial Inclusion is one of the important parts of the financial system and Islamic Financial Literacy is a concept that requires knowledge about the Islamic financial system and can contribute positively to financial inclusion. This research has several goals. First, it aims to determine students' Islamic financial literacy levels in various faculties in a Turkish university. Secondly, it is aims to investigate the relationship between Islamic financial literacy level and financial attitude and behavior. Third, the impact of Islamic financial literacy on the entrepreneurial tendency is predicted. Finally, determining whether the level of Islamic financial literacy differs according to various demographic factors, especially the faculty variable, whether it is taking finance, or Islamic finance courses, is among the sub-objectives of the study. The universe of the research consists of students studying in the third and fourth grades of the faculties of business, engineering, and theology at Duzce University. 513 questionnaire data obtained within the scope of the research and data were analyzed with SPSS 25 statistical program. As a result of the research, Islamic Financial Knowledge levels and Islamic Financial literacy were gauged. It was determined that the Islamic Financial Knowledge levels and Literacy were quiet low among students and, students taking Islamic finance courses had high Islamic finance literacy. Also, looking attractiveness did not put a difference on Islamic financial knowledge, it provided a statistically significant relationship between those looking attractive to entrepreneurship and those not looking attractive to entrepreneur with respect to Islamic financial literacy level.

TI  - Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour to Explore Predictors of Financial Behaviour Among Working Adults in Malaysia
T2  - FIIB BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - The current study sought to explore the predictors of financial behaviour among working adults based on the theory of planned behaviour. This study employed the correlational cross-sectional questionnaire-based research design. In total, 558 samples were obtained through a purposive sampling technique. The measurement model and proposed research model were evaluated using partial least squares structure equation modelling. The findings revealed that financial knowledge is positively associated with the attitudes towards retirement, perceived behavioural control, subjective norms, and financial behaviour of working adults. In addition, the findings demonstrated that retirement attitude, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms each had a positive relationship with behavioural intention towards planning for retirement. Furthermore, the results showed that behavioural intention and perceived behavioural control are positively associated with the financial behaviour of working adults. The findings could aid financial educators and advisors in delivering the correct blend of financial knowledge to assist working adults in making better financial decisions and practising proper financial behaviour.

TI  - Advisors for micro-entrepreneurs: is one as good as another in accessing alternative finance?
T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - Using a novel large database of Italian micro-entrepreneurs, we investigate how different sources of external business advice affect access to alternative finance. We distinguish three categories of external business advice: professional financial, professional non-financial, and non-professional. We also test whether financial knowledge of micro-entrepreneurs enhances their advice seeking for financial decision-making. We find that the use of alternative financial instruments increases when external business advisors are used, but some are more useful than others. Only professional financial advice is shown to increase the probability of accessing alternative finance by micro-enterprises, while non-professional and professional non-financial advice does not have the same effect. We also find that being more financially literate increases the probability that micro-entrepreneurs seek advice from highly professional sources, i.e., objective financial knowledge helps shape the quality of financial advice requested.
   Do external business advisors help micro-entrepreneurs access alternative finance? Yes, they do. But only if they are professional financial advisors. Focusing on Italy, where 90-95% of all SMEs are micro-SME, as in the most of EU-27 Member States, our paper demonstrates that the source of advice matters to access alternative finance. We distinguish three categories of external business advice: professional financial (financial intermediaries and external financial consultants), professional non-financial (external accountants and public institutions), and non-professional (relatives, friends, and business partners). Only professional financial advisors increase the probability of using alternative financial instruments by micro-enterprises, while non-professional and professional non-financial advisors do not. This implies that micro-entrepreneurs, to diversify their sources of funding, should overcome their concerns related to the value and expense of specialized financial advisory services and improve their use. Moreover, our paper shows that being more financially literate increases the probability that micro-entrepreneurs seek advice from highly professional sources. From a policy perspective, this implies that governments should encourage and support the use of business professional financial advisors among micro-entrepreneurs, both directly by giving tax advantages to financial advisory services, and indirectly by strengthening financial education programs targeting micro-entrepreneurs.

TI  - Investor preferences, financial literacy and intermediary choice towards sustainability
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Based on a large and representative sample of Italian adults, our study aims to detect the determinants of retail investor preferences for socially responsible (SR) financial intermediaries, i.e., intermediaries adopting environmental, social and governance strategies and offering both traditional and SR financial products. We demonstrate that SR financial intermediaries are chosen by individuals characterized by high self-reported orientation towards SR investments and high financial literacy. Disaggregating financial literacy into its three determinants, we show that the higher the financial knowledge and the more correct financial behavior of retail investors related to savings and financial control, the higher their preference for SR financial intermediaries. On the other hand, individual financial attitude towards savings and spending displays a negative relationship with this preference. Moreover, retail investors with more specific knowledge about portfolio diversification choose more SR financial intermediaries than other people.

TI  - Antecedents of indebtedness for low-income consumers: the mediating role of materialism
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this is to propose a model in which materialism is a mediator of the effects of self-esteem, impulsiveness, attitude toward debt, attitude toward credit card and economic vulnerability on consumer indebtedness. The effects of financial knowledge, financial ability, credit card use and demographic variables are also taken into account. Design/methodology/approach Survey data from a sample of 1,245 low-income consumers from Brazil were used to test the hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Findings First, materialism has a significant effect on consumer indebtedness; at the same time, it is influenced by self-esteem, impulsiveness and attitude toward debt. Second, materialism acts as a mediator, e.g. higher impulsiveness triggers materialism, which influences debt level. Third, indebtedness is higher for women and those who use a higher number of credit cards and are more educated.

TI  - A Comprehensive Approach to Measuring Financial Vulnerability and Literacy: Unveiling Connections
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - In the aftermath of the 2007-08 financial crisis, the worsening financial conditions of households increased concerns about their financial vulnerability (FV). In this context, policymakers embraced the notion of financial knowledge to foster sound financial behaviors among individuals and households, aiming to mitigate the detrimental effects of FV on households' financial wellbeing and the overall economy. However, the relationship between FV and financial literacy remains inconclusive. This lack of definitive findings may stem from limitations in measuring FV and narrow focus on specific dimensions of financial literacy. This paper analyzes the relationship between financial literacy and FV by creating a comprehensive measure of (the level of) FV and considering different dimensions of financial literacy. Using a sample of 8,554 individuals in Spain obtained from the 2016-17 Survey of Financial Competences, we construct a continuous measure of FV by using Nonlinear Principal Components Analysis (NLPCA). Then, we employ OLS and ordered probit regressions to examine the potential association between different dimensions of financial literacy and FV. The findings indicate that the level of FV is negatively related to self-perceived financial knowledge, while no statistically significant relationship is found regarding objective financial knowledge. Evidence also reveals that "highly financially included" individuals are more likely to exhibit financial resilience. These findings highlight the need for the development of financial education initiatives that are action-oriented.

TI  - What makes Americans fall behind in their finances? Evidence from the national well-being survey
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The question of how often Americans fall behind on their finances is analyzed using the National Financial Well-Being survey of the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. An ordered logit model is proposed to study the effect of individual and household characteristics on the likelihood of falling behind in one's finances. The analysis shows that traditional variables such as income, age, education, and health are statistically significant predictors of falling behind in one's finances. In addition, the study shows that the volatility of income, saving habits, and individuals' financial knowledge significantly contribute to the explanation of Americans' economic behavior.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY
AB  - This study analyses the relationship between geographic space, social networks, and financial knowledge in interregional equity crowdfunding flows based on the concept of financial ecology. Using data from a leading Dutch equity crowdfunding platform, we find that interregional crowdfunding investment decreases with geographic distance. Furthermore, the negative effect of distance is weaker if interregional social networks are strong and if the investor region has a high concentration of the financial industry. The results extend the conceptual foundation of financial ecology by explaining how individual behaviors affect the macro-level output of a financial ecology.

TI  - Financial Literacy on College Students in the Context of Tuxtepec, Oax
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The objective of this study is to determine the variables that explain the knowledge of financial literacy among college students in Tuxtepec, Oaxaca, and to identify whether the level of financial literacy that prevails in these students differs by gender, age and school grade. To do so, the study is based on a theoretical reference recently exposed by Goyal and Kumar (2021), who analyzed 502 articles between the years 2000 to 2019, in their findings they found that the gender gap and financial education, impacts on financial behavior. The participants of the study were 600 college students of a public sector Institution. The statistical procedure for data analysis was: first, the instrument was validated with Cronbach's alpha and normality through the values of skewness and kurtosis, then the correlation matrix, Brattle's test of Sphericity with Kaiser and the sample adequacy measure were calculated, and the extraction of components under the criterion of eigenvalues > to 1 and total variance. Finally, to verify if there is a difference in relation to the variables of financial education, gender, age and employment status, an ANOVA analysis is performed. Finally, the findings show that there is a difference between the variables: Gender and financial literacy (Saving and Investment); Age (Spending and Credit); Employment Status (Income, Money Management, Spending and Credit, Saving and Investment). This leads us to think that the higher level student presents a low level of financial knowledge, which could affect their personal growth, and that the gap of gender, age and employment status makes a difference in relation to the variables studied.

TI  - Identifying financially illiterate groups: An international comparison
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Targeted policy interventions are more effective than one-size-fits-all initiatives. This paper proposes the use of k-means cluster analysis to identify vulnerable groups with respect to financial literacy. Using a rich sample of 12 countries, we distinguish 4 groups with varying financial literacy levels, and examine their socio-economic characteristics. The results suggest that individuals in the most vulnerable financially illiterate groups are on average, single, less-educated and unemployed with low incomes. This contrasts with those in the strongest group: individuals with the highest financial knowledge, financial behaviour and financial attitudes scores are on average highly educated males who live together with a partner. They earn a high income and hold several financial products. Integrating these insights into national strategies which promote financial literacy will not only lead to more effective but also to more efficient policy initiatives by focusing on the particular weaknesses of certain subgroups and using the appropriate transmission channels.

TI  - Children's understanding of financial literacy and parents' choice of financial knowledge learning methods in Malaysia
T2  - METHODSX
AB  - Financial literacy is an essential lifelong skill that should be taught to children at any age. It holds the key to develop a generation of adults who are knowledgeable about money and the economy. Additionally, OECD (2018) suggests that using digital tools could significantly enhance financial literacy and well-being. Therefore, this paper aims to: (i) assess the financial literacy level of primary school children in the northern region of Malaysia and (ii) explore interactive and engaging methods for teaching financial literacy. The sample size was determined using Krejcie and Morgan's (1970) approach, resulting in 419 primary school students aged 7 to 12 and their parents. An online questionnaire was employed, and multi-regression analysis was conducted. The findings highlighted those primary students displayed a high level of financial literacy, scoring above 80 % on the questionnaire. Furthermore, parents expressed a preference for their children to enroll in personal finance subjects offered by schools, have financial assignments or activities at school, and engage in online financial games. The study emphasized the crucial roles of schools, teachers, and active parental involvements to enhance financial literacy. This study recommends incorporating interactive and attractive teaching methods through in-class and online activities at the school level.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - This study investigated the influence of financial socialization on financial distress and demonstrated the importance of both cognitive and noncognitive ability channels through which this relation operates. Using data from a nationally representative sample of adult US residents, the results showed that adults in the bottom quintile of financial socialization are significantly more likely to experience financial distress than those in the top quintile. We also provide evidence that financial socialization is related to financial distress both directly and indirectly through cognitive ability measures of financial knowledge and financial skills, as well as the noncognitive ability measure of financial self-control. The findings highlight the importance of financial socialization in familial contexts. Implications for personal finance advocates, financial educators, children and family service providers, and policymakers are discussed.

TI  - Financial literacy among university students: A study in eight European countries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - This study analysed the level of financial literacy among university students in Estonia, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation and Turkey. The purpose of the study was to determine the level of financial literacy among university students, and to find out the relationship between financial knowledge and demographic characteristics of students. Online survey instrument was used to collect data. 409 fully completed questionnaires were accepted for analysis. Logistic regression was used to analyse of impact of the demographic characteristics on financial literacy. Overall mean of correct answers for the survey was 72.2%. This result represents a medium level of financial literacy about personal finance. Results indicate that male students, business major students, PhD students, those who live in a rental house, those whose parents have high level income, those who get advice on financial matters from their friends, those who took financial course before, those who get financial information about financial issues from university education, and students from Poland are more knowledgeable on personal finance. More financial courses should be provided in university education programmes, which could help more students handle their finances better and improve their financial wellbeing. It should be taken into consideration that in recent years, environmental and technological influences on financial literacy may be more important than parental influence.

TI  - PERCEIVED FINANCIAL WELL-BEING AS ANTECEDENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING: EVIDENCE FROM BRAZIL
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE MARKETING
AB  - Purpose: This study investigates how the relationship between perceived financial well-being and psychological well-being is influenced by income loss in the context of the adverse economic and social conditions resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.
   Method: A survey conducted with 959 Brazilian respondents allowed the research hypotheses to be tested by means of multigroup structural equation models.
   Originality / Relevance: Individuals who reported having experienced larger income losses also reported lower levels of financial and psychological well-being. Among the predictors of psychological well-being we tested, expected future financial security is the most important.
   Results: Our findings show that after controlling for gender, age, and income, current money management stress and expected future financial security (the present and future dimensions of perceived financial well-being, respectively), but not financial knowledge, are statistically significant to explain psychological well-being.
   Theoretical / Methodological contributions: The role of financial knowledge to predict financial well-being is weakened in the presence of the psychological variables investigated, which has important implications for financial education efforts. Banks and other financial institutions can create tools to enhance personal awareness and responsibility over one's financial future.
   Social / Managerial contributions: Managerial and societal implications include the provision of knowledge that may allow financial education programmes, economic empowerment interventions, and public policies aimed at reducing the negative impact of the perceived financial strain on well-being to be better targeted.

TI  - Family Communication, Privacy Orientation, & Financial Literacy: A Survey of U.S. College Students
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Increasing personal financial responsibility has increased the value of financial literacy in recent decades, leading to an emphasis on financial literacy and educational programs. However, these educational efforts have demonstrated mixed results, necessitating further research regarding the influences on personal financial knowledge and capabilities. The present study explores the effect of family socialization, specifically through an analysis of family communication patterns and privacy orientations, hypothesizing that open dialogue regarding financial matters will encourage transmission of knowledge and a willingness to seek information when needed. Reporting on the results of an online survey of college students, the results imply that individuals from more communicative families report stronger financial literacy. This finding suggests that financial literacy education programs might be more pedagogically useful if they incorporate and facilitate conversation around financial matters. The findings also reinforce the necessity of financial education.

TI  - Credit record overconfidence and alternative financial service use
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of credit record overconfidence on the use of alternative financial services (AFSs). Design/methodology/approach Using data from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS), the authors estimate logistic regressions on the use of at least one AFS by adding a credit record confidence variable that captures deviations between self-assessments of credit record management and the number of reported behaviors that would negatively affect aspects of a Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score. Findings The authors find that respondents with credit record overconfidence have over two times higher odds (123.9%) of using AFS than the odds of respondents with financial knowledge overconfidence (46.8%), relative to their reference categories. When compared directly, those with only credit record overconfidence have 32.6% higher odds of using AFS than those with only financial knowledge overconfidence. Practical implications The results provide implications for education programs, not only for vulnerable groups at higher risk for AFS use but also for those with cognitive biases, such as credit record overconfidence. Potential solutions include personal financial education that includes debiasing and behavioral techniques for overconfidence. Originality/value This paper studies, for the first time, the effect of deviations between actual and perceived credit record management on AFS use.

TI  - Are business students more financially literate? Evidence of differences in financial literacy amongst Portuguese college students
T2  - YOUNG CONSUMERS
AB  - Purpose Considering the importance of financial literacy (FL) in people's lives the goal of this study aims to assess the level of FL of young Portuguese students, addressing the impact of the level of education on the FL of college students. Design/methodology/approach Data from a non-probabilistic sample of 185 students attending higher education bachelor's and master's degrees courses in Economics, Management and Marketing was collected between February 25 and March 23, 2019, using an online questionnaire. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed using IBM SPSS 25 to analyze the data. Findings The findings show that the level of the degree (bachelor's or master's degree) and the academic background of the individual's parents have a positive impact on FL. Moreover, among individuals with a high level of FL, gender and professional situation are additional predictors. Furthermore, the authors observed that the level of FL of Portuguese students attending higher education is overall low, especially in terms of their knowledge of the main financial concepts, which may call for public policies to be implemented so that to reduce this vulnerability. Research limitations/implications Among limitations is the limited sample collected, restricted to a particular target, Portuguese students attending business-related courses such as Economics, Management and Marketing, either studying for a master's or bachelor's degree. This issue restricts the generalization of the overall findings to other students studying different fields. Future studies can collect a random and representative sample. Practical implications This study test can be replicated to generate a diagnosis in any region or country, identifying how financially literate the region under analysis is. Also, this can be done to verify the evolution of FL after educational interventions. Social implications FL is an important competence. In fact, youngsters in the whole world have been suffering from a lack of financial knowledge (FK), and some characteristics of them can push them into indebtedness, and, even bankruptcy, such as a higher level of status consumption, the tendency to have an attitude of self-appraisal, to be self-centered, to seek instant gratification. This study helps to lead to a better understanding of this phenomenon. Originality/value Addressing college students attending different levels is an add-on to the existing body of literature. This paper contributes to study differences in FL between college and master students, enlightening and evaluating the role of scholarship maturity on financial education. Furthermore, some of the findings challenge the extant knowledge regarding the influence of professional experience, gender and age on the level of FK that students have. Finally, the current approach is innovative as it addresses FK, FL and numeracy in the same study.

TI  - The Relationship Between Financial Education in Young Adults and Financial Literacy: A Review of the Literature in Canada and the United States
T2  - ACCOUNTING PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Professional accounting bodies in Canada and the United States, and throughout the world, have funded programs to improve financial literacy for many years. This ongoing interest stems from the expected benefits of improved financial behavior for individuals, society, and financial markets. However, the fact that relatively little research on financial literacy has been published in accounting journals suggests that few accounting academics are aware of, interested in, or motivated to work on the topic. This review helps to identify what we know about the effectiveness of financial education programs intended specifically for young adults, who constitute the demographic group likely to gain the most from improved financial literacy. Our review identifies factors that impinge both on the effectiveness of financial education programs and the research examining these programs. Noteworthy factors include (1) a lack of theoretical frameworks to guide the programs and research on the programs, (2) a tendency for outcome measures to capture financial knowledge rather than financial behaviors, and (3) the need for stronger research designs. We also note some possible instructional design considerations in developing financial education programs and highlight financial literacy as a promising area of research for accounting academics. Our findings can help guide improvements to financial education programs and encourage further research to assess the effectiveness of financial literacy programs.

TI  - The impact of knowledge on labeling schemes promoting sustainable investing
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Sustainable labeling schemes are frequently used to simplify decisions for consumers, for example, in financial contexts, and to subsequently promote sustainable investments. The purpose of this research is to, against the backdrop of dual processing theories, outline consumer reactions to sustainability-oriented investment labels. Experimental results from a representative sample show that objective labels are perceived more favorably by financially knowledgeable individuals. Three developed and validated scales, measuring general and specific financial knowledge as well as environmental knowledge, further suggest that this evaluation is domain contingent, with only knowledge that aligns with choice domain interacting significantly with label format. The importance of the choice domain prevails with regard to the interaction between knowledge and the perceived effectiveness of an investment. We are able to verify retail investor reactions to sustainable labeling, which are of major importance for fund both companies and legislators considering an introduction of mandatory sustainability labeling.

TI  - Decomposition of the Financial Capability Construct: A Structural Model of Debt Knowledge, Skills, Confidence, Attitudes, and Behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - Based on a nationally representative sample of adult Poles (N = 1,004), we examined structural relationships between financial knowledge, skills, confidence, attitudes, and behavior in debt-domain. We found that financial confidence-at least regarding debt-related issues-is tied to debt attitudes and behavior beyond the extent to which the attitudes and behaviors are linked to objective debt knowledge. Moreover, the relationship between objective knowledge and confidence turned out to be insignificant in our study. These findings suggest that confidence should be used as a separate marker of financial capability. Having established that skills correlate with behavior and attitudes differently than objective knowledge, we argue also to include them separately in financial capability measurements.

TI  - The role of financial status, attitudes, behaviours and knowledge for overall well-being in Portugal: the mediating role of financial well-being
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS
AB  - PurposeAlthough overall well-being is a well-studied phenomenon, financial well-being only recently has attracted scholars' attention. Accordingly, this study aimed to understand the relationship between financial well-being, its predictors (financial status, financial behaviour, financial knowledge and financial attitudes) and overall well-being. Design/methodology/approachThe authors collected data from 262 working adults. FindingsThe results showed that only financial status was positively related to financial well-being and the latter was positively related to overall well-being. It was also found that financial well-being mediated the relationship between financial status and overall well-being. In sum, these results showed a multidisciplinary concept of overall well-being and that individuals tend to prioritize financial security over the other components. Research limitations/implicationsThe cross-sectional nature of the data is a limitation. Practical implicationsPractically speaking, this research is relevant because it highlights the evidence of financial status as an important influence on financial well-being, as well as the role of household income in individuals' financial satisfaction. Originality/valueThe study addresses a call for research on the relationship between financial well-being, its main predictors and how these contribute to explain overall well-being.

TI  - Financial Literacy of Managers in Serbian Health Care Organizations as a Path to Sustainability
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Adequate financial management is of great importance to the health care system. In the contemporary state of affairs, health care is facing numerous limitations due to drastic costs and growing pressures to provide quality health care. In such appalling conditions, the managers of health organizations must build skills and knowledge that go beyond the comfort zone of their clinical competencies. It is necessary to develop their leadership skills. Bearing in mind the importance of financial competencies, the general aim of this paper is to determine the competencies of the managers of Serbian health institutions (private and public sector) in this area. Insufficient attention has been given to how health care organizations' financial literacy affects their sustainability. For the purpose of this prospective research, a questionnaire was created that surveyed the managers of various health care institutions. The results of this study indicated that managers of health organizations have a relatively modest level of financial knowledge. However, they participate in financial activities to a large extent. This gap between the function they perform and the knowledge they have can potentially harm the well-being of the health care organizations they lead. Managers of organizations in the public sector showed a more active role in the development of business plans and more frequent independent decision making, while managers of organizations in the private sector gave more importance to financial control, negotiation, and internal financial reporting, for the improvement of the management process.

T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - This research uses data from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study to investigate the attributes of households that engage in higher levels of family financial planning. Greater levels of financial planning are evidenced when households report more positive responses in planning for retirement, saving for emergencies, and establishing a will. Based on an ordinal logistic regression, various demographic attributes, objective and subjective financial knowledge scores, frequency of participation in financial education, and the frequent use of financial websites or apps to help with financial tasks are positively related to higher levels of family financial planning. The results have implications for financial literacy education and the development and marketing of websites and apps for personal finance.

TI  - Financial literacy of high school students in the Netherlands: knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS EDUCATION
AB  - We examined levels of financial literacy (knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and self-reported behavior) among 15-year-old high school students in the Netherlands (N= 2025), and investigated which factors are associated with the different financial literacy components. Our findings show lower levels of financial literacy among students in the lowest track in high school, students with low mathematical ability, immigrant students, students with low SES, students with mothers without a university degree, and students who do not discuss financial matters with family and peers. Notably, our findings show a large gap in financial knowledge levels between the lowest and highest high-school tracks in the Netherlands. These findings are useful for designing effective financial education and intervention programs, and for identifying groups that may benefit the most from financial education programs.

TI  - Research on factors affecting people's intention to use digital currency: Empirical evidence from China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - In the era of FinTech, many countries are currently exploring the viability of their own digital currencies due to the vast potential in terms of efficiency, security and accessibility. Some digital currencies have been under rapid development and real-world trials have recently been deployed. The purpose of this paper is to understand the main factors that could affect people's intention to use digital currency via an empirical study. A survey was employed to collect data and the final sample consisted of 408 respondents in China. The responses were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. The results showed that financial knowledge, perceived value, openness to innovation and perceived convenience positively impact people's intention to use digital currency. It was also found that perceived value can be significantly anteceded by perceived monetary value, perceived functional value, and perceived emotional value. In addition, the mediating effect of perceived value on the influencing path between financial knowledge and intention to use was also confirmed. The findings can be utilized by governmental related authorities or FinTech companies to enhance the perception of users and develop effective strategies for increasing their intention to use digital currency.

TI  - Building a Model on Influence of Behavioural and Cognitive Factors on Personal Financial Planning: A Study Among Indian Households
T2  - GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Personal financial planning is an emerging area of interest, given the complexities and risks involved in investments and financial markets. As an extension to studies in the field of cognitive and behavioural decision theories, the role of financial cognition (FC) and mental accounting (MA) is examined as antecedents to personal financial planning (PFP) of Indian households and established as a model to represent the same. The study considers factors, that is, financial attitude (FA), risk attitude (RA) and financial knowledge (FK), to measure FC and uses the components of mental budgeting (MB), current income (CI), current assets (CAs) and future income (FI) to study MA as per the behavioural life cycle hypothesis. The study used a structured questionnaire to explore PFP in all the areas of financial interest, that is, cash flow management (CM), investment (INV), insurance (INSU), retirement (RP), tax (TAX) and estate planning (EP). The salaried individuals from different sectors are considered as samples for the study. The data have been collected from all-India representative samples. The analysis has been done with 359 responses from Indian households. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) has been used to establish and validates the measurement model.

TI  - Millennials' financial behaviour and financial well-being: the moderating role of future orientation
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - Most Millennials tend to have a limited consideration of the future, prioritising the current social context and often opting for present-focused thinking and actions. This inclination may lead to compromised decision-making, particularly in their finances, potentially resulting in irresponsible financial behaviour and reduced financial well-being. Hence, with an integrated framework of cognitive development theory and social cognitive theory, the study delved into factors affecting financial behaviour and financial well-being, while examining the moderating role of future orientation within the context. In total, 529 Millennials from Malaysia completed the questionnaire. Covariance-based structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to assess both the measurement and structural model. Results indicated that financial knowledge significantly affected financial attitude, perceived behavioural control, and financial behaviour. Similarly, financial attitude, financial self-efficacy, and perceived behavioural control significantly affected financial behaviour. Further, financial behaviour significantly affects the financial well-being of Millennials. This study identified the vital moderating role of future orientation in the model. The findings offer a fresh perspective on personal finance, providing future researchers with valuable insights to investigate the evolving trends among Millennials.

TI  - Contextual influences on financial preparedness of middle-aged workers: A four-country comparative life course study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SCHOLARS OF MARKETING SCIENCE
AB  - In countries where pensions are not the main responsibility of employers or governments, workers need to plan for their own postretirement financial well-being. This study investigates the financial preparedness of middle-aged workers in the United States, the Netherlands, Thailand, and Malaysia. Within- and between-country differences of three variables - financial satisfaction, financial knowledge, and saving proneness - are examined as indicators of financial preparation and financial well-being. The life course paradigm provides the basis for the conceptual framework. In addition to structural factors unique to each of the four countries, the study considers the effects of contextual variables, including individual attributes, early-in-life socialization experiences, and variables that locate the person in social structures. The results of this exploratory study show how the impact of these variables on the three indicators of financial preparedness of middle-aged workers differs across the four countries. Socioeconomic status is the only variable that positively affects financial satisfaction in all four countries. The results also shed light on the value of the life course approach for understanding individual- and country-based differences in the levels of preparation for financial well-being in later life.

TI  - How does financial literacy impact on inclusive finance?
T2  - FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB  - Inclusive finance is a core concept of finance that makes various financial products and services accessible and affordable to all individuals and businesses, especially those excluded from the formal financial system. One of the leading forces affecting people's ability to access financial services in rural areas is financial literacy. This study investigated the impacts of financial knowledge on financial access through banking, microfinance, and fintech access using the Bangladesh rural population data. We employed three econometrics models: logistic regression, probit regression, and complementary log-log regression to examine whether financial literacy significantly affects removing the barriers that prevent people from participating and using financial services to improve their lives. The empirical findings showed that knowledge regarding various financial services factors had significant impacts on getting financial access. Some variables such as profession, income level, knowledge regarding depositing and withdrawing money, and knowledge regarding interest rate highly affected the overall access to finance. The study's results provide valuable recommendations for the policymaker to improve financial inclusion in the developing country context. A comprehensive and long-term education program should be delivered broadly to the rural population to make a big stride in financial inclusion, a key driver of poverty reduction and prosperity boosting.

TI  - Can a student-managed fund transfer expert financial knowledge? Examining trustee voting consensus in a student-managed investments program
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - PurposeThe "experience is the best teacher" model assumes that acquiring expertise in a given domain reduces biases. Research in expert knowledge in investment decisions has shown better ability to produce improved results in asset selection or portfolio returns. Universities created student-managed investment funds (SMIFs) to train students in portfolio management as fiduciaries. However, analyses of the effectiveness of the SMIF as a medium for expert knowledge transfer have not been done.Design/methodology/approachThe authors' analyze an SMIF's structure against established models of expert knowledge transfer, using the voting patterns of the trustees of the fund from the recorded minutes of the fund's meetings to show the fund's structure and outcomes demonstrate effective knowledge transfer. Voter consensus between faculty and student trustees is one proxy the authors use for knowledge transfer.FindingsConsensus between faculty and students was uniformly high across all recommendations. Chi-square tests were employed to test for independence between approval of recommendation and level of consensus, showing dependence in most cases. Analysis of sale returns over the 12-year sample period showed significantly better performance of asset sales over relevant benchmarks for both equity and fixed income portfolios.Originality/valueMost analyses of SMIF structure concentrate on well-known issues with things like student turnover, summers or other structural issues. Performance is evaluated based on returns. This study looks at the SMIF as an expert knowledge transfer medium and examines expert/novice decision approval in terms of knowledge transfer.

TI  - How Investors Attitudes Shape Stock Market Participation in the Presence of Financial Self-Efficacy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate how investor's money attitudes shape their stock market participation (SMP) decisions. This study followed the theory of planned behavior (TPB), and a survey was conducted to collect the responses from active investors. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for the analysis of proposed relationships among the constructs, and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to check the interrelation of the variables and validity of the constructs. This research has concluded that investor's money attitudes are significant to affect their stock market participation decisions. Further, it was found that risk attitudes partially mediate the relationship between money attitudes and stock market participation. Moreover, financial knowledge and financial self-efficacy positively moderated the relationship between money attitudes and stock market participation. This research is one of the early attempts at studying the money attitudes of investors and introduces financial self-efficacy as a moderating construct between money attitudes and stock market participation. The sample size for this study was 250 respondents which can be increased in future research, and the same relationships can be tested by using a larger sample. Moreover, this study has used money attitudes as predictors of stock market participation. Still, many other variables, like personal value, can also be taken to investigate their influence on stock market participation.

TI  - Design and Evaluation among Young Adults of a Financial Literacy Scale Focused on Key Financial Decisions
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - The present study underpins the design and validation of a Financial Literacy (FL) scale in the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) context. Though scales are available, they do not meet contextual characteristics and seem to miss out on a focus on Key Financial Decisions (KFD). Scale design was consistent with an extensive literature review (2010-2021). Forty-four items scale covering the dimensions of Financial Attitude, Financial Behavior, and Financial Knowledge were presented to 478 young adults aged 18-30, and women 58% of them. The results reflect a robust FL scale by applying Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The data about young adults' FL can be used as a benchmark in future studies fostering the development of FL in the Latin American and Caribbean contexts.

TI  - Consumers' knowledge of cashless payments: Development, validation, and usability of a measurement scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - The global digital shift, recently accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, requires that consumers have knowledge allowing them to navigate increasingly cashless markets safely and effectively. To enable valid and reliable measurement of such knowledge, we used data obtained from a random sample of adult Poles to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties and applicability of an original cashless payments knowledge scale (CPK scale). Our analyses based on Item Response Theory show that some evident subdomains exist within the CPK construct. The separate dimensions of the CPK merge into a coherent scale with solid psychometric properties. We find that the CPK score depends on the place of residence, education, and household size, and is positively related to safe cashless behavior. Our findings may have important implications for financial institutions as well as policymakers interested in segmenting consumers in terms of their financial knowledge, potential risks resulting from deficits in this knowledge, and enhancing financial literacy.

TI  - The causal mechanism of financial education: Evidence from mediation analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - This paper uses a field experiment in India and mediation analysis to investigate the causal mechanisms between financial education and financial behavior. Focusing on the mediating role of financial literacy, we propose a broader definition of financial knowledge that includes three dimensions: numeracy skills, financial awareness, and attitudes towards personal finance. We then employ causal mediation analysis to investigate the proportion of the treatment effect that can be attributed to these three channels. Strikingly, we find that numeracy does not mediate any effects of financial education on financial outcomes. For simple financial actions such as budgeting, both awareness and attitudes serve as pathways, while for more complex financial activities such as opening a savings account, attitudes play a more prominent role-though these patterns appear to be sensitive to confounding. We also compare our mediation analysis results to other empirical techniques that have been typically used to study mechanisms, and we discuss how mediation analysis differs from these approaches.

TI  - SaveWise: The impact of a real-life financial education program for ninth grade students in the Netherlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - This experimental study with a pre-post and follow-up design evaluates the financial education program "SaveWise"for ninth grade students in the Netherlands (n = 713). SaveWise adopts a holistic approach, emphasizing action rather than mere cognition. Benefitting from explicit instruction embedded in real-life contexts, students in the program set a personal savings goal and are coached on how to achieve it. The short-term treatment results indicated that SaveWise expanded the students' level of financial knowledge; encouraged their intentions to save more, spend less and earn an income; and broadly improved their financial and savings behavior. The program demonstrated that it could serve as an effective and low-cost method to enhance the financial literacy of prevocational students, a financially vulnerable group. Although long-term effects were expressed only through financial socialization, this study offers evidence linking curricula to increased knowledge and improved behavior for a specific sample of students.

TI  - Influence of human capital and social capital on MSME access to finance: assessing the mediating role of financial literacy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThe authors investigate the role of financial literacy in influencing the relationship between human capital and social capital, with access to finance of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).Design/methodology/approachData were gathered from 337 MSMEs in Brunei Darussalam, and analysis on the data was carried out using a number of statistical methods. The relationships between human capital, social capital, financial literacy and access to finance were analyzed using PLS-SEM.FindingsThe results show that human capital does influence access to finance but contrary to previous studies, the influence is negative. Financial literacy is an important element in the relationship between human capital, social capital and access to finance, although it plays a greater role in the relationship between social capital and access to finance. Further analysis shows that financial knowledge is significant in moderating the relationships between human and social capital with access to finance. Financial skills is found to only moderate the relationship between social capital and access to finance.Originality/valueTo the authors' knowledge, this study is the first that integrates the human capital, social capital, financial literacy and access to finance in a single model. The authors also highlight the importance of enhancing the financial literacy of MSMEs so that the problem of access to finance can be alleviated, especially in developing countries.

AB  - PurposeThis article describes financial professionals' perceptions of their clients' financial behaviors and the explanatory factors underlying these behaviors.Design/methodology/approachIn this qualitative research, the authors seek to understand financial professionals' experiences in relation to how their clients manage their own finances. The authorse conduct and analyze 26 semi-structured interviews with financial professionals from several industries within the financial sector in Canada.FindingsThe professionals in this study noted that despite their clients' financial knowledge, several other factors can explain these individuals' financial behaviors. They include psychological factors, (such as financial bias, the need for instant gratification, and the lack of awareness regarding the long-term effects of certain types of financial behaviors), financial habits (such as lifestyle, financial planning and lack of discipline) and the financial system's flexibility with respect to debt financing and repayment. These perceptions are categorized according to whether they are related to debt financing or repayment, savings or investments.Originality/valueBy using a qualitative methodology that relies on the perceptions of financial professionals, this study aims to better understand the financial behaviors of individuals and households, and these behaviors' underlying factors. This study's findings could be useful to various stakeholders interested, in one way or another, in financial literacy, such as organizations aiming to strengthen and promote financial literacy, educators, researchers, regulatory bodies of financial institutions and financial advisers.

TI  - Determinants of the decision to adopt Islamic finance: evidence from Oman
T2  - ISRA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC FINANCE
AB  - Purpose - Small and medium enterprises' (SMEs) capital structure and financial policies are important areas of policy concern. Only a limited number of studies on capital structure have, however, been conducted on SMEs, and this deficiency is particularly evident when investigating what influences funding decisions around Islamic finance. This paper accordingly aims to investigate whether Omani SME owner-managers' intention to adopt Islamic finance is influenced by their knowledge of Islamic finance, their own characteristics and/or their firms' characteristics.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors administered a questionnaire survey via face-to-face interviews to 385 SME owner-managers operating in Muscat, Oman's capital city. The Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) non-parametric test was used to analyse the questionnaire survey data.
   Findings - The findings indicate that while SME owner-managers' Islamic financial knowledge and personal characteristics do influence their intention to adopt Islamic finance, their firms' characteristics have no significant influence on SME owner-managers' decisions to accede to Islamic financing.
   Research limitations/implications - The research's first limitation is that it gathered data from SME owner-managers in Muscat only. Future studies could survey a wider sample of Omani SME owner-managers. Second, the study's findings cannot be generalised to large and public firms, as the sample includes owner-managers of SMEs only. Finally, there is a need to investigate other factors such as nonfinancial and behavioural factors, which were not explored in the present study, but which may influence SME owner-managers' Islamic financial decisions.
   Originality/value - Theoretical and empirical studies on capital structure have focused primarily on large listed firms. Only a few studies have paid attention to the capital structure of SMEs, particularly in the context of an emerging market such as Oman. This gap in the literature is mostly evident when investigating the factors that influence the funding decision towards Islamic financing in a country, such as Oman, where Islamic finance represents a new banking sector offering.

AB  - Using a special-purpose module implemented in the Health and Retirement Study, we evaluate financial sophistication in the American population over the age of 50. We combine several financial literacy questions into an overall index to highlight which questions best capture financial sophistication and examine the sensitivity of financial literacy responses to framing effects. Results show that many older respondents are not financially sophisticated: they fail to grasp essential aspects of risk diversification, asset valuation, portfolio choice, and investment fees. Subgroups with notable deficits include women, the least educated, non-Whites, and those age 75+. In view of the fact that retirees increasingly must take on responsibility for their own retirement security, such meager levels of knowledge have potentially serious and negative implications.

TI  - Framework of managerial wisdom: an analysis using the TOPSIS and MICMAC process
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS
AB  - PurposeBehavioral characteristics and the existence of personal knowledge and skills that are essential in forming a capable manager with specialized insight, is one of the most important evaluation processes in appointing a manager. Wisdom as a trait of a set of personal characteristics and cognitive knowledge of a capable manager will gain competitive advantages for the company and external stakeholders. The purpose of this study is to present the framework of managerial financial wisdom through qualitative and quantitative research methodologies.Design/methodology/approachThe study uses grounded theory methodology to identify factors for managerial financial wisdom and uses a MICMAC process to evaluate the power of driving and dependence among factors. MaxQDA software was used for data coding and analysis. The MICMAC process by determining the location of each of the sub-themes in the four-dimensional matrix, seeks to determine the most effective criterion in the context of the study. The method of data collection is mixed and in terms of philosophical nature, this study is inductive/comparative.FindingsThe results of the research in the qualitative part indicate the presentation of a framework based on two categories, four components, and thirty themes. The results of the quantitative part of the study also showed that the most important factor of managerial financial wisdom is market-oriented values. Finally, it was found that the social trust caused by managerial financial wisdom is considered a factor in gaining more shares in the capital market due to the positive stimulus in this dimension.Originality/valueThe study is relevant for both practitioners and academia and has significant implications. For practitioners, the structural linkages identified will help enhance managerial wisdom effectiveness and drive the critical metrics for financial decisions and shareholders' rights protection. The study may help financial market practitioners better understand future policies. Academia and researchers can take reference from methodologies used in this study for exploring factors of interest and developing matrix linkages among them.

TI  - Financial Literacy as a Driver of Financial Inclusion in Kenya and Tanzania
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Efforts are being exerted in many developing countries to promote financial inclusion by increasing individuals' access to financial products and services. However, literature suggests that increasing the supply of financial products and services per se may not help in expanding financial inclusion unless concerted efforts are exerted in enhancing financial literacy. This is because financially literate individuals are more likely to appreciate the value of financial services and hence take up financial products. This paper reports the link between financial literacy and inclusion using data from a demand side financial inclusion survey conducted in Kenya and Tanzania in 2016 covering a total of 6029 individuals. Results from our instrumental variable regression analysis confirmed that financial literacy is a strong driver of financial inclusion. This implies that efforts to promote financial inclusion need to be accompanied with financial literacy campaigns in both countries.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & FINANCE LIBRARIANSHIP
AB  - This article examined the level of financial literacy among university students in Ghana (N = 3932), and investigated which factors are linked with the different financial literacy components. This article is motivated by the increased drive toward financial inclusion and the critical role of financial knowledge in an increasingly sophisticated financial world. The framework used, assesses students' knowledge in money management, savings and borrowing, investments, and insurance. The research findings show moderate knowledge in savings and borrowing but low level of knowledge in other finance issues among university students. Notably, the findings reveal that gender, work experience, subject of study, and mother's level of education are all important determinants of financial knowledge among the students. The findings further show that students with relatively high financial knowledge are more likely to have sound judgment on financial issues; make the right financial decisions and have sound personal financial management practices. Based on the findings of the study, a national policy on financial literacy and educational programs are urgently needed as intervention to improve the level of financial knowledge of university students.

TI  - Survey of Hungarian High School Students' Financial Literacy in the Last 10 Years Based on the Econventio Test
T2  - PUBLIC FINANCE QUARTERLY-HUNGARY
AB  - The Econventio Association in cooperation with the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration of the University of Szeged has been developing the financial literacy of high school students since 2011. In our study, we summarize the main findings of surveys over the past 10 years, based on a total of 110,000 responses. Our findings show high school students to have inadequate and superficial financial knowledge. The results show that high school students have low financial literacy levels. Financial knowledge is positively related to long-term oriented thinking, the opinion formed about self-sufficiency and self-care, and the general attitude towards finances. In addition to the ever-increasing role of digital financial information sources, high school students draw their financial knowledge mainly from what they see at home, which influences test scores in a negative way, while at the same time financial literacy education has a positive effect on students' financial literacy. As age and experience increase, the level of financial knowledge increases too, especially in the topics of labour market, credits and loans and insurance, however, the problematic areas remain the same over time, both for high school students and the adult population: calculating interest, compound interest, the meaning of expressions 'at least' or 'at most, or comparing different financial offers.

AB  - Drawing on social cognitive theory and social network literature, this study examines how objective financial knowledge (OFK) and financial knowledge network intensity (FKNI) influence retirement investment decisions through the mediation of subjective financial knowledge (SFK). Using survey data, we find that OFK and FKNI enhance 401(k) account holders' risk-taking and investment quality. We also find a unique role of SFK in retirement investment decisions: SFK mediates the effect of OFK on risk-taking, not on investment decision quality. While the interaction between OFK and FKNI does not influence investment decision quality through SFK, it does positively influence risk-taking through the mediation of SFK, which implies that OFK and FKNI serve as complements to each other in risk-taking through the mediation of SFK. We suggest that individuals may reap benefits from financial literacy and financial network-building programs for improving retirement investment decision-making.

TI  - The Case for the Need for Personal Financial Literacy Education in Botswana Secondary Schools
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - Personal financial literacy (PFL) is an imperative life skill that all 21 st-century students should have. Research shows that the levels of financial literacy in both developing and developed countries are very low across people of all ages. This deplorable state of affairs has negative implications on the well-being of the populace, as evidenced by increased indebtedness, lower saving, poor planning for retirement, and the making of many poor personal financial decisions. Recognizing the potential benefits of financial literacy at both individual and national levels, many countries have started to offer financial education in their schools. This article analyzed the business subjects' curriculum at secondary school level in Botswana and literature published on the subject of PFL, and found that there exists a gap in this area and a need to offer PFL to all learners in the school system. Despite the need for such a move, Botswana does not have a deliberate program in its curriculum that specifically addresses this problem. This article discusses the benefits of personal financial education, the inadequacy of current business subjects to meet this need, and concludes by recommending a mandatory PFL subject in the Botswana secondary school curriculum.

TI  - Subjective Knowledge Differences within Couples Predict Influence over Shared Financial Decisions
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB  - Romantic partners rarely have equal responsibility for, and equal influence over, their shared financial matters. Intuitively, one might expect the partner with greater financial knowledge to have greater influence. However, unless partners are routinely quizzing each other, they are unlikely to have a precise understanding of each other's objective financial knowledge (OFK). We document that partner A's understanding of partner B's OFK is colored by partner B's self-perceived OFK (subjective financial knowledge [SFK]). Accordingly, SFK plays an important role in financial decisions that romantic partners jointly navigate. In a survey and an incentive-compatible lab experiment (both with couples), we find that partners' SFK differences reliably predict their relative influence over shared financial decisions. Partners' OFK differences generally played a more modest role in those shared decisions. However, when romantic partners individually make financial decisions, OFK plays a more prominent role. Thus, SFK appears to be particularly important in interpersonal contexts.

TI  - Exploring Determinants of Desirable Financial Behaviors Using Decision Tree Analysis Evidence From Four Waves of National Financial Capability Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - The purpose of this article is to utilize decision tree (DT) analysis to examine the relationship between income level, financial satisfaction, financial confidence, financial knowledge, and several demographics with a goal of better understanding desirable financial behavior. The emphasis of this analysis is focused particularly upon better understanding the role of financial knowledge in desirable behavior outcomes. DT analysis is most useful when an analysis includes numerous variables and solving problems where the cumulative learning process is inherent. Our DT analysis of four FINRA National Financial Capability datasets (2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018) suggest that financial knowledge is a relevant variable only under specific circumstances and for respondents with relatively higher income levels. Key variables in the DT analysis included income level and financial satisfaction.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY IN SOUTH AFRICAN HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS: AN UNMET NEED IN HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - The holistic training of healthcare professionals as a strategy to build the healthcare system has received considerable attention. As part of training a holistic workforce, it is expected the healthcare professionals be component in management and governance. Financial literacy is low globally and impacts financial decision-making and business management. Despite high levels of education, medical professionals elsewhere in the world have low financial literacy. Financial literacy levels in South African healthcare professionals are unknown. This study investigated the degree of and contributors to financial literacy in South African healthcare professionals. A validated financial literacy questionnaire was completed by 473 healthcare professionals, of whom 130 owned private practices. Financial literacy scores were determined as a composite score based on financial knowledge, financial behaviour and financial attitudes. The independent contribution of demographic factors to financial literacy were determined in multivariate linear regression analysis. Financial literacy in healthcare professionals was relatively high (73%). Of the total cohort 24%, 27% and 63% did not reach acceptable scores for financial knowledge, behaviour, and attitudes, respectively. Sex, medical specialty and being in private healthcare predicted financial knowledge scores. Higher income and self-rated financial knowledge were associated with financial literacy. In business owners, business-specific financial literacy was low (51%), and not associated with general financial literacy (r=-0.11, p=0.40). Education in economics and finance predicted business-related financial literacy scores (p=0.02). Financial attitudes that favour the short term may impact financial decision-making in healthcare professionals in managing small businesses and state healthcare facilities. Current approaches in health professions education may impact the success of the healthcare system in South Africa.

TI  - The Adoption of Robo-Advisory among Millennials in the 21st Century: Trust, Usability and Knowledge Perception
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Robo-advisor has become the new personal wealth management and investment method. Nonetheless, certain predicaments are faced by robo-advisor companies as a tech-savvy young group of individuals seems to be less willing to adopt robo-advisory. This study investigates millennials' adoption of robo-advisory in terms of financial knowledge, trust and usability perception in the 21st century to enhance sustainability. This quantitative study focuses on individuals belonging to the millennial generation who were born between 1981 and 1996. The findings indicate that the millennials who possess financial knowledge, as well as perceived usability and trust have a significant positive effect on the willingness to embrace robo-advisory as a tool for wealth management. The higher the financial knowledge of an individual, the more likely they are willing to adopt a robo-advisor. Government may provide appropriate avenues to enhance financial knowledge, and credible and user-friendly platforms with resources to boost the millennials' usage of robo-advisors for their wealth management. With robust artificial intelligence, robo-advisory continues to support users, especially millennials, through three dimensions of sustainable development: environment, society, and economy.

TI  - Affectivity and riskiness of retirement investment decisions
T2  - PERSONNEL REVIEW
AB  - Purpose Drawing on broaden-and-build theory and promotion- and prevention-focus theory, the authors examined the role of positive and negative affectivity (PANA) on the riskiness of investment decisions. The authors also examined the mediating impact of financial knowledge network intensity (i.e. the level of communication with financially literate others in employees' social network) on the PANA-riskiness of investment decisions relationship. Design/methodology/approach Study 1 used a sample of undergraduate students and operationalized risk using a hypothetical investment scenario. Study 2 replicated and extended the Study 1 findings using employees and operationalized risk using their real-world investment allocations. Findings Both Studies 1 and 2 provided support for the negative direct relationship between NA and the riskiness of investment decisions. Study 2 found PA was marginally positively related to the riskiness of investment decisions. Financial knowledge network intensity mediated the relationship between NA and the riskiness of investment decisions in Study 2. Research limitations/implications - The findings suggest that employees who see the world in a generally negative light tended to have weaker financial knowledge networks, and this may be one mechanism that explains why they make low-risk investments. Practical implications - Financial knowledge networks can provide access to critical information regarding investment opportunities. Socialization training or social mixers can be used to help employees build and improve their financial knowledge networks. Originality/value The authors integrate the research on PANA, social networks, and investment decisions to illuminate the social network processes that explain how affectivity impacts the riskiness of retirement investment decisions.

TI  - Screening Financial Literacy in Young Business-Oriented Professionals. Conjectures of Financial Duality and Financial Divergence
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The main purpose of this research is the estimation and analysis of the level of Financial Literacy of professionals oriented to business management. The sample was composed of young executives starting MBA studies. The level of FL was analyzed in detail through various statistical techniques, under two perspectives. The first perspective referred to the dimensions involved in the definition of FL and the second referred to the demographic characteristics of the population. Theresults show a level of FL that does not reach an acceptable minimum in its global measurement; neither in its different dimensions, but the Information dimension. In general terms, this result is reproduced at the different demographic segments analyzed. In terms of the demographic categories, there were no differences in age or gender. Based on the income level, there were differences in the Knowledge and Information dimensions. Likewise, based on the number of dependents and on profession, there were differences in the Consciousness dimension. The results allow us to make two important conjectures for further research: the Financial Duality and the Financial Divergence conjectures. It is postulated that the Financial Duality conjecture could be explained through Kahneman's theory of System 1/System 2 and corresponding behavioral biases.

TI  - Financial Literacy and Financial Behaviour: Experimental Evidence from Rural Rwanda
T2  - ECONOMIC JOURNAL
AB  - We organise a field experiment with smallholder farmers in Rwanda to measure the impact of financial literacy training on financial knowledge and behaviour. The training increased financial literacy of participants, changed their savings and borrowing behaviour and had a positive effect on the new business start-up. However, it failed to have a significant (short-term) impact on income. Using a two-stage regression framework, we identify enhanced financial literacy as one of the important factors explaining behavioural changes. We also test whether financial knowledge spillovers from trained farmers to their peers in local village banks but find no evidence for that.

AB  - This paper extends the theory of fuzzy diseases predictions and bankruptcy likelihood in order to improve cause detection by introducing Fuzzy Entropy, as an alternative measure for the analysis of causes. In this case, the fuzzy entropy allows to assess a level of uncertainty in the expert's valuation of the firm and the visualization of certain problems in experts' valuation levels, which can cause higher levels of relative uncertainty in the analysis of causes in business diagnosis. Also, with this extension, the model can be useful to develop suitable computer systems for monitoring companies' problems, warning of failures and facilitating decision-making.

TI  - An Empirical Study on the Role of Socioeconomic Status and Demographic Factors on Financial Literacy of Engineering Students
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - This research sought to investigate how financial literacy among engineering students in Uttar Pradesh, India, is influenced by socioeconomic status and demographic variables. A sum of 478 questionnaires was gathered from graduating engineers across multiple colleges and universities. IBM SPSS version 23.0 was employed for the analysis of the collected data, and chi-square techniques were utilized to examine the findings. The outcomes of the study indicated that there was no noteworthy association between gender and financial literacy among engineering students. However, caste, parents' occupation, family income, and parent's education levels demonstrated a substantial influence on the financial literacy of engineering students. Additionally, higher GPAs were correlated with increased levels of financial literacy. These results can aid in the development of focused interventions by educators and policymakers to raise engineering students' financial literacy levels. Overall, the study provides significant insights into the relationship between financial understanding, demographic variables as well as socioeconomic factors among engineering students, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to improve financial literacy levels among this population.

TI  - Financial capability and households' financial vulnerability: evidence for the Spanish case
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The present study examines the potential relationship between financial capability and household financial vulnerability for a sample of Spanish individuals. Design/methodology/approach The methodology combines a literature review deepening on the two concepts addressed in this paper - financial vulnerability and financial capability - and an empirical analysis. Based on a sample of 7,811 Spanish individuals taken from the Survey of Financial Competences, different probit regression models are used to test the relationship of key independent variables (namely, financial literacy, financial inclusion, and financial capability) with household financial vulnerability. Findings Empirical evidence points to the existence of a negative relationship between financial capability and household financial vulnerability. Besides, the variable on financial capability demonstrates, per se, a greater explanatory power than its two components (i.e. objective financial literacy and financial inclusion) separately, particularly in the case of financial literacy. Originality/value This paper contributes to the research on household finances along three main dimensions. Firstly, it enhances the research on financial capability by analysing how it relates to consumers' financial vulnerability; an association barely explored by the extant literature. Secondly, it gets closer to the multifaceted concept of financial vulnerability through a wide set of objective and subjective proxy variables. And thirdly, the empirical evidence found leads to proposing some recommendations aimed at improving households' financial capability.

TI  - Consumer Financial Capability and Financial Satisfaction
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine associations between consumer financial capability and financial satisfaction. Consumer financial capability was measured by three sets of variables, perceived financial capability, financial literacy, and financial behavior. Using data from the 2009 US State-by-State Survey of Financial Capability, the results indicated the positive association between perceived financial capability and financial satisfaction. The findings suggested that desirable financial behavior increases while risky financial behavior decreases financial satisfaction. Subjective financial literacy was also found to contribute positively to financial satisfaction. The positive association between objective financial literacy and financial satisfaction was found in bivariate analyses but not in multivariate analyses. The results imply that to enhance consumer financial well-being, consumer financial education programs should emphasize action taking and encourage consumers to avoid risky financial behavior, engage in desirable financial behavior, and improve financial self-efficacy.

AB  - In this paper, we have adapted the components and factors of an existing financial resilience measurement framework, and leveraged a survey that reflects the decision-making of Irish social housing residents in money management and their capacity to cope with unexpected financial shocks. Extending existing financial literacy definitions, this paper shifts the perspective from measuring financial resilience components to exploring the drivers that could impact that resilience at an individual level. This bridging of the objective and subjective domains contributes to the common good by exploring how citizens deal with daily decision-making in a financialised world.

TI  - Risky Business: Precarious Manhood and Investment Portfolio Decisions
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF MEN & MASCULINITIES
AB  - The precarious manhood paradigm posits that threats to masculinity are met with attempts to reassert masculinity. We investigated the precarious manhood paradigm as applied to investment risk and foreign/domestic investment decisions. We sampled 652 men online, and tested whether threats to masculinity resulted in increases in investment risk and domestic investments in a hypothetical investment portfolio decision task. Results indicated that there was a main effect of threat for investment risk, such that those in the threat condition were willing to invest more in riskier investments. There was also an interaction with general risk-taking, such that men lower in general risk-taking responded to the threat condition by increasing investment in riskier options, while men higher in general risk-taking did not. A main effect of condition did not emerge for domestic investment, but there was an interaction, such that men lower in financial knowledge responded to the threat condition by increasing domestic investments, but men higher in financial knowledge did not. These results suggest that threats to masculinity influence financial investment decisions, and suggest that person-level variables (e.g., risk-taking, knowledge) may buffer the effects of threats to masculinity.

TI  - The nexus of financial literacy and depositor discipline in commercial banks
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose This study investigates the relationship between financial literacy, that is, financial knowledge and financial skills, and market discipline, with financial behavior as the mediating variable. The study uses data from Indonesian depositors in commercial banks to estimate the relationship between the variables. Design/methodology/approach This study applied an explanatory method with a quantitative approach by surveying 343 Indonesian commercial bank depositors, in both public and private banks. The responses were collected using the purposive sampling technique. This study applied structural equation modeling (SEM) using AMOS software to analyze the data and then to estimate the relationships between financial literacy and market discipline. Findings This study shows that financial knowledge, financial skills, and financial behavior can improve market discipline. This study also provides empirical evidence that financial behavior has a mediation effect on the relationship between financial skills and financial knowledge to the market discipline. Research limitations/implications The results show that all financial literacy latent variables have a significant positive effect on market discipline. Financial behavior has a mediation effect on the relationship of financial skills and financial knowledge with market discipline. Depositors with good knowledge of financial products and services, who are skillful in managing their money and who demonstrate good financial behavior can effectively discipline the market. They will punish imprudent banking by actions such as the withdrawal of their funds. Financial literacy significantly enhances market discipline. Practical implications This study provides recommendations for regulators, practitioners, academics, and depositors, that is, the actors in the financial industry, on the need to empower consumers with financial literacy, while also promoting market discipline to recognize the importance of these two aspects for the sustainability of financial stability. Originality/value This study provides empirical evidence for the market discipline literature, using a behavioral approach, namely, the action of withdrawal of funds. The study then estimates the relationship between financial literacy, that is, financial knowledge and financial skills, and market discipline, with financial behavior as the mediating variable.

TI  - Integrating affect, cognition, and culture in Hispanic financial planning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - Debt is at a peak and consumers purport needing help with financial planning. To better understand the antecedents of financial planning behavior, the purpose of this paper is to examine the importance of cultural values in financial decision making within the context of Hispanic American consumers. A new conceptual model is proposed to integrate affect (cultural value) and cognition (financial knowledge) in financial planning.
   Design/methodology/approach - To uncover respondents' views on cultural values, financial knowledge, financial attitude, and financial planning behavior, an online survey hosted on a business school's website was distributed to members of two Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. The survey consisted of five parts, and took each respondent an average of 15 minutes to complete. The final data set has 158 observations.
   Findings - Results analyzed using structural equation modeling confirmed the hypotheses that financial knowledge, attitude, and perceived control simultaneously influence Hispanic consumers' intentions to purchase financial planning products or services. More interestingly, these results confirm that multiple different routes coexist in the decision-making process, especially within the Hispanic financial planning context.
   Originality/value - Key contributions of this paper include the conceptualization of cultural value as an antecedent to Hispanic financial behavior; detailing the different routes to financial decision making for US Hispanic consumers; and informing financial service managers on marketing strategies toward Hispanic consumers.

TI  - Prediction of Business Failure with Fuzzy Models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB  - This paper extends the theory of fuzzy diseases predictions in order to detect the causes of business failure. This extension is justified through the advantages of the reference model and its originality. Moreover, the fuzzy model is completed by this proposal and some parts of it have been published in isolated articles. For this purpose, the fuzzy theory is combined with the OWA operators to identify the factors that generate problems in firms. Also, a goodness index to validate its functionality and prediction capacity is introduced. The model estimates a matrix of economic-financial knowledge based on matrices of causes and symptoms. Knowing the symptoms makes it possible to estimate the causes, and managing them properly, allows monitoring and improving the company's financial situation and forecasting its future. Also with this extension, the model can be useful to develop suitable computer systems for monitoring companies' problems, warning of failures and facilitating decision-making.

TI  - Antecedents of the Youngster's Awareness About Financial Literacy: A Structure Equation Modelling Approach
T2  - VISION-THE JOURNAL OF BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
AB  - Financial literacy has been identified as an important functional area that attains a special concern in the Indian government policies and plans specially designed for the financial market. SEBI has issued various guidelines and awareness programs towards investment financial products, digital payment systems, consumer protection and so on. Therefore, the purpose of the present article is to analyze the level of financial literacy among youngsters in India. The study examined the relationship between the antecedents of financial literacy, that is, financial attitude, financial knowledge and financial behavior. The theoretical purposed model was tested with the help of primary data that was collected with the help of the self-structured questionnaire. A total of 647 responses were obtained from the respondents belonging to the holy city Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India. To identify the financial literacy antecedents and their inter-relationship, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling were applied to the collected data. The findings indicated that in the case of the Indian population, financial attitude and financial behavior were significantly associated with financial literacy. The moderation analysis reveals that males are more particular about financial knowledge and financial behavior in comparison to females. Respondents belonging to the age group of 26-30 years have better financial knowledge. Respondents who have income more than (sic)800 thousand and below two years have more financial knowledge. This article contributes to the theoretical body of knowledge by providing insights about the interesting topic of financial literacy by identifying its antecedents. The study also highlights the impact of the demographic variables as moderators on the antecedents of financial literacy. The outcomes of the study are vital for the government in the designing of public policies. The findings are helpful for the educational program designers for the outlining of the programs and syllabus for the subjects taught in the schools and colleges. The findings are useful for the bank managers to understand the psychological behavior as well as demographic variables for the effective marketing and communication of their financial products.

TI  - The impact of entrepreneurial education on the propensity of business students to support new ventures: A moderated mediation model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This research aims to investigate the role of financial self-efficacy in mediating the relationship between entrepreneurial education and venture capital intention, as well as the moderating influence of government support on the relationship between financial self-efficacy and venture capital intention. The target population consists of Lahore students from public and private universities who have already studied entrepreneurship. Based on the 250 responses to the online survey the findings show the mediating role of financial self-efficacy between entrepreneurial education and intention toward venture capital. Moreover, it also indicates the moderated effect of government support on the relationship between financial self-efficacy and intention toward venture capital. This study will not only help the curriculum committees in business schools to design entrepreneurial education outlines that enable the students to explore the different financing modes by including financial knowledge to cope with financial challenges but also to the government officials in devising financing plans accompanied by their expertise in the development of a business.

TI  - Mindsponge-Based Reasoning of Households' Financial Resilience during the COVID-19 Crisis
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The COVID-19 crisis was remarkable because no global recession model could predict or provide early notice of when the coronavirus pandemic would happen and damage the global economy. Resilience to financial shocks is crucial for households as future crises like COVID-19 are inevitable. Therefore, the current study aims to examine the effects of financial literacy and accessibility to financial information on the financial resilience of Vietnamese households through the lens of an information-processing perspective. The Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics was employed on a dataset of 839 samples for the investigation. We found that households of respondents with better financial knowledge and investment skills are less likely to be financially affected during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, but the effect of investment skills is weakly reliable. Accessibility to financial information through informal sources (having a household member working in the financial sector) and formal sources (participating in a financial course) is positively associated with the respondents' financial knowledge and investment skills. This finding suggests that the spillover effect of financial knowledge and skills among residents exists, leading to better resilience toward financial shocks. However, if the financial information is inaccurate, it might lead to misinformation, false beliefs, and poor economic decisions on a large scale.

TI  - Financial literacy, education and risk aversion: a survey of French students
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose Financial literacy is generally seen as an important factor explaining a broader set of investment behaviors. In the context of a weak financial knowledge in France, this article focuses on the particular situation of Generation Z (individuals born after 1995) and more particularly management students likely to be involved in financial decisions in the near future. Design/methodology/approach The analysis is based on a survey conducted in the Fall of 2019, through a questionnaire distributed to 300 students enrolled in a French business school. Findings The results indicate that financial knowledge is poor for students who do not follow a specialized course in finance. This research also demonstrates the importance of risk behavior, showing that risk adverse students are also those with the lowest level of financial literacy. Originality/value This article contributes to the academic literature by focusing on students in France. It is the first study to examine Gen Z financial literacy and its implications. It raises awareness on the importance of financial education in the education curriculum.

TI  - Gender difference in overconfidence and household financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE
AB  - We study overconfidence related to financial knowledge among men and women within U.S. households, venturing beyond prior research confined to subsamples such as CEOs, retail investors, and older adults. By expanding our study to the broader U.S. population, we provide evidence that women, on average, exhibit greater overconfidence than men - a discrepancy attributable to the gender difference in financial knowledge. We find a positive association between overconfidence and both investment risk-taking and savings behavior, while it correlates inversely with prudent credit card management. Our findings emphasize the instrumental role of financial literacy in mitigating overconfidence, providing a deeper understanding of the interaction between gender, overconfidence, and financial literacy. Our results carry profound implications for policy interventions and educational strategies.

TI  - Determinants of financial resilience: insights from an emerging economy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Financial Literacy Survey of 2018 response is used to study the impact of financial knowledge, financial inclusion, and socio-demographic characteristics on financial resilience. The measurement of financial resilience considers elements related to keeping control of money, taking care of expenditures, having a financial cushion, handling financial shortfall or stress, and having financial planning. Using a sample of 3395 individuals across Malaysia, we find that greater financial knowledge is associated with the probability of being financially resilient. Greater financial inclusion in terms of having more bank accounts and holding more financial products is linked to the probability of being financially resilient. We also find that financial resilience varies across certain socio-demographic characteristics. Implications of the findings are discussed.

TI  - Is Financial Education Positively Associated with Consumer Stock Market Satisfaction? Evidence from China
T2  - DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB  - This study aims to investigate the associations between financial education and consumer stock market satisfaction. Consumer financial education is measured through the objective aspect incorporating formal and informal financial knowledge education, and the subjective aspect is reflected through consumers' attitudes toward financial education. Using data from China's urban consumers, the results indicate a positive association between financial education and consumer stock market satisfaction. The findings suggest that consumers who were financially literate at high schools or colleges are more satisfied in participating in the stock market. Moreover, consumers who spend more money and time, as well as those who think financial education is more important, feel more satisfied in participating in stock market investment activities. The results imply that it is necessary to increase the supply of formal financial education in high schools and universities, encourage consumers to invest more in the informal education of financial knowledge, and promote policymakers to formulate informative policies to make consumers aware of the importance of financial education.

TI  - Bringing Voluntary Financial Education in Emerging Economy: Role of Financial Socialization During Elementary Years
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC EDUCATION RESEARCHER
AB  - The level of financial literacy tends to be low in children, while information and financial education for children are very limited, especially in developing countries without mandatory financial education in schools. This study examined the effects of a classroom financial education program on financial knowledge. We used "Financial Intelligence Curriculum" designed for elementary school students from grade 1-6, focusing on the need and want, priority needs, income, spending, saving, and sharing. Using experimental method with pre-post-test and control group design, we found that the treatment group who received financial education has improved financial knowledge relative to the control group. The study provides evidence that elementary school students are appropriate targets for financial education and that it is necessary to develop mechanisms for effective learning to improve financial capability at an early age.

TI  - Unraveling the impact of financial literacy on investment decisions in an emerging market
T2  - BUSINESS STRATEGY AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - We examined the impact of financial literacy on investment decisions, taking a sample of 384 investors from India. A multi-dimensional construct to measure financial literacy was developed basis the theory of planned behavior. Investment decisions were measured by taking six proxies on a five-point Likert-type scale. The causal link between financial literacy and investment decisions was examined using simple linear and binary logistic regression. The results exhibited moderate to high levels of financial literacy among investors. Results further confirm that investors' investment decisions are positively influenced by their financial literacy levels. It is concluded that financial literates have a greater likelihood of making informed investment decisions. These outcomes have practical implications for policymakers, managers, employers, and investors, especially in an emerging market context, making a case for relevant financial education programs to empower investors. The study adds to the theory of financial literacy developing a multi-dimensional construct and introducing Macroeconomic Factors as a proxy for investment decisions.

TI  - Characteristics of Chinese Lottery Consumers' Financial Literacy and its Relationship with Problem Lottery Gambling
T2  - JOURNAL OF GAMBLING STUDIES
AB  - Problem lottery gambling among lottery consumers has increased globally over the years, rendering it necessary to explore their financial literacy characteristics and to answer whether financial literacy inhibits problem lottery gambling. In the present research, a total of 316 Chinese lottery consumers, who constitute the culturally underrepresented samples in the extant literature, completed a survey about financial literacy and problem lottery gambling. Using the propensity score matching method, we compared financial literacy between Chinese lottery consumers and Chinese general population (N = 10,058). The results showed that the five facets of financial literacy (i.e., financial knowledge, financial capacity, financial management values, financial ethics, and wealth values) among Chinese lottery consumers were significantly lower than Chinese general population. Among Chinese lottery consumers, their Homo sociologicus index (including financial ethics and wealth values) negatively predicted problem lottery gambling, but the Homo economicus index (including financial knowledge, financial capacity, and financial management values) was not significantly associated with problem lottery gambling. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings were discussed.

TI  - How university business incubation supports entrepreneurs in technology-based and creative industries: A comparative study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Business incubators (BIs) provide entrepreneurs with access to critical resources (for example, physical, financial, knowledge, social, legitimacy, and so on) that support venture development. Little is known about how support needs differ between entrepreneurs pursuing technology-based (TB) and creative-industry (CI) opportunities. Yet these differences may affect their ability to benefit from incubation. This is the first comparative study addressing this gap. Focusing on university BIs, our qualitative analysis reveals that TB entrepreneurs benefit from physical capital supporting proof of concept, financial grants, and technical and industry-specific knowledge capital. In contrast, CI entrepreneurs benefit from physical capital supporting product development, financing of smaller-scale projects, and knowledge capital focused on business basics. External legitimacy was more important to TB entrepreneurs, while internal social capital mattered more to CI entrepreneurs. We draw on value creation and capture to explain these differences. The findings have implications for research and practice concerned with incubation and university-based entrepreneurial support.

TI  - Impact of financial literacy on financial well-being: a mediational role of financial self-efficacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of financial literacy on financial well-being among the business school faculties. Both the variables (financial literacy and financial well-being) are operationalized as multi-dimensional constructs to undertake the study. Moreover, the paper also endeavored to examine the mediating role of financial self-efficacy between financial literacy and financial well-being. The paper adopts a survey by questionnaire method to gather data from 203 business school faculty members through the simple random sampling (SRS) technique. Confirmatory factor analysis was used for scale validation, and structural equation modeling was used for hypotheses testing. Mediation was tested using percentile bootstrap with a 95% confidence interval. The study found a significantly positive impact of financial literacy as well as its dimensions on financial self-efficacy and financial well-being. It was also found that financial self-efficacy partially mediates the effect of financial literacy on financial well-being. Measurement of the constructs was done on subjective measures, and the study is limited to business school faculties only. The present research findings could be employed in crafting educational programs for business schools. These programs shall guide such institutions in imparting the knowledge and skills among students regarding their personal finances in terms of savings and retirement planning. The study was focused on the business school faculties of the Jammu and Kashmir region, who are less exposed to the financial literacy programs due to factors like frequent lockdown and internet shutdowns. Moreover, it is generally witnessed that salaried class people in Jammu and Kashmir pay less attention to long-term financial planning for retirement, which makes the present study more relevant. Therefore, this study will prove beneficial to all the employees, especially the business school faculties, to understand the importance of financial literacy and its subsequent effect on financial well-being.

TI  - Readability of Korean-Language advertising disclosures moderates knowledge effects
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose Government policy mandates information disclosure in financial communications to protect consumer welfare. Unfortunately, low readability can hamper information disclosures' meaningful benefits to financial decision making. Thus, this experiment tests the product evaluation and decision satisfaction of Korean consumers with less or more subjective knowledge and with or without personal finance education. Design/methodology/approach A between-subjects experiment examined responses of a nationally representative sample of 400 Korean consumers toward a Korean-language credit card advertisement. Findings Financial knowledge improves financial product evaluation and decision satisfaction. More readable disclosures improved evaluation and satisfaction among less knowledgeable consumers. Less readable disclosures did not. Consumers without financial education exhibited lower evaluations and decision satisfaction regardless of readability. More knowledgeable consumers and those with financial education performed equally well regardless of disclosure readability. Practical implications Financial service providers seeking more accurate evaluations and better decision satisfaction among their customers should use easier-to-read disclosures when targeting consumers with less prior financial knowledge. Social implications One-size-fits-all financial communications are unlikely to achieve public policy or consumer well-being goals. Government-mandated information should be complemented by augmenting financial knowledge and providing personal finance training. Originality/value Although almost a quarter of the world's population lives in East Asia, this is the first examination of readability in disclosures written in East Asian characters rather than a Western alphabet. Previous readability research on Asian-originating financial disclosures has been conducted on English-language texts. This study extends knowledge of readability effects to growing East Asian markets.

TI  - Factors that influence the level of financial literacy among young people: The role of parental engagement and students' experiences with money matters
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
AB  - This paper focused on the family as context for financial socialization and students' experiences with money matters to explain the acquisition of financial knowledge of young people in fifteen OECD countries and economies. We used data from the second OECD PISA financial literacy assessment in 2015. Multilevel regressions of students' performance in financial literacy were presented. When explaining financial literacy differences across countries a significant predictor of financial literacy was a well-functioning educational system proxied in our study by the quality of its mathematical and scientific education. After accounting for performance in mathematics and reading and other variables, estimates of multilevel regressions by country showed that students' financial literacy was associated mainly with understanding the value of saving and discussing money matters with parents. In some countries, exposure to (and the use of) financial products - in particular, holding a bank account - improved students' financial knowledge as well.

T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The main purpose of this Empirical study is to explore the impact of financial literacy can help to promote financial investments among college students and how financial literacy programs and knowledge are vital for all college students. This research study explores the impact of financial literacy in promoting financial investments. The very most influencing variables in investment planning are financial knowledge, financial risk perception, and Cost of investment. The practical implications are giving information about the financial curriculum framing for the college students which might have an impact on financial investment, the total sample collected was 121 from different colleges, where 8 respondents did not fill correctly, so the relevant sample size was 113. After initiating primary data collection using a questionnaire with measuring and ranking scales the variables such as financial knowledge, risk perception, and cost of investment were found out. During the study, we found that financial literacy is a significant factor that has a considerable effect on risk perception. The perception of risk has been removed or even shifted after taking up some financial courses because it provides considerable changes and choices of financial investment and it is also pressurizing or budding the managers of concerning field, especially investment. financial literacy has an influencing relationship with investment planning. As the demographic variable of study, Age and education have a significant impact on financial literacy. So finally, above all analysis, we can state that financial literacy plays a fundamental role in financial investment planning. Higher education institutions that want to update their educational programs must keep financial literacy in mind while developing syllabi for every institution. Courses with a direct tie to financial investment planning can be given additional weightage. Students should be able to apply their financial knowledge in practice through stimulating games, case studies, industry visits, and internship opportunities

TI  - What You Think You Know: The Effects of Prior Financial Education and Readability on Financial Disclosure Processing
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Disclosures in advertising and other forms of marketing communication have been examined as a means to help consumers understand complex financial information and make more informed decisions regarding financial products and services. The authors extend inquiry into this supposition by looking at the readability of disclosures in relation to consumer financial literacy. In an experiment, it was found that while highly readable disclosures facilitate more accurate information processing for those with prior financial education, such disclosures might actually inhibit accurate processing for those without prior financial education. This suggests that policy cannot rely on mandated disclosure in marketing communications alone. Rather, disclosures in financial product or services communication can only be effective if such disclosures are paired with other forms of education leading to greater financial literacy.

TI  - Financial literacy, financial capabilities, and sustainable business model practice among small business owners in Nigeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE & INVESTMENT
AB  - The study investigates how financial literacy and financial capabilities influence small firms' sustainability in Lagos and Ogun States, Nigeria. It employs a survey research design to collect data from 300 small business owners across the two States. Data collected were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique. The study shows that environmental sustainability, financial sustainability and social responsibility are significant determinants of small firms' sustainability in Nigeria. Financial literacy and financial capabilities practices also have a significant positive impact on firm sustainability. However, the use of savings product shows a significant adverse effect on firms' sustainability. The findings imply that financial literacy knowledge and practice in small business operations enhance firms' sustainability. The study recommends that small firms should incorporate sustainability models into their business operations and improve their financial knowledge to maintain sustainability. Small business owners should also invest their savings in an appropriate investment product that suits their risk tolerance.

TI  - Overconfidence and investment: An experimental approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE
AB  - A positive relation between overconfidence and investment provision has been theoretically justified and practically assumed in the literature, but has not been thoroughly investigated. We test and confirm this positive relation between direct measures of overconfidence in one's financial knowledge and choice of investment. More precisely, strong overconfidence results in excess investment, underconfidence induces underinvestment, whereas moderate overconfidence leads to accurate investments. Our experimental results are based on different subject pools, financial professionals and students, and different media: computer-, paper-, and web-based. The degree of one's overestimation of one's individual financial knowledge relative to one's actual knowledge as well as relative to the knowledge of peers explains investment decisions better than one's actual knowledge. The relation between overconfidence and investment is robust to the degree of individual risk aversion, the riskiness of the investment projects, and to the changes in incentives structure.

TI  - From Security to Freedom- The Meaning of Financial Well-being Changes with Age
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - Financial well-being is becoming more prominent in policy, research, and the financial sector. However, there is a lack of understanding of its meaning, and the vast majority of financial well-being research employs quantitative methods whereas recent literature reviews advocate for qualitative studies into the meaning of financial well-being and its associations with age. We contribute to that by conducting exploratory qualitative research into the phenomenon of perceived financial well-being and its components. It is based on three studies each of which used in-depth semi-structured interviews (N = 47). The first key finding is that youth perceive financial well-being to be comprised of three components: keeping the current lifestyle and making ends meet; achieving desired lifestyle; and achieving financial freedom. In contrast, older groups distinguish only two: keeping and achieving the lifestyle in the present and in the future. The second finding is that the definition of financial freedom differs across age groups. Young people aspire to become financially independent, while middle-aged individuals prioritize supporting their children, and older people are afraid of becoming a financial burden. Third, regardless of age, many do not plan, save or invest for securing their financial well-being. We conclude by proposing implications for increasing financial well-being in different age groups, and suggesting paths for further investigation.

TI  - Gender differences in recollections of economic socialization, financial self-efficacy, and financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - The OECD/INFE international surveys of adult financial literacy (OECD/INFE 2016, 2020) show gender differences in financial literacy in developed countries in Europe. In this study, we examine whether these differences can be explained by gender differences in parental economic socialization using the Dutch 2018 DHS household survey. We investigate whether respondents' recollection of economic socialization when young predict their adult economic behavior and self-assessed financial knowledge. The results from ordinal logit and logistic regressions and for nonlinear equations decompositions reveal gender differences in the recollection of economic socialization and in how socialization practices are related to economic behavior and self-assessed financial knowledge. Men have to a greater degree than women been socialized in terms of having paid work outside the home, while women more often than men report that their parents controlled their spending. Moreover, we find gender differences in how men and women benefitted from the same socialization practices.

TI  - Investment behaviour in mutual funds: is it a knowledge-based decision?
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to make an analysis of investment behaviour in mutual funds, by looking at different investment decision influencers and trying to identify the extent to which the investment decision is knowledge-based. The paper has three main purposes, namely, to assess the degree to which the considered factors influence investment decision-making in young capital markets from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE); to compare the investment behaviour in the three considered countries; and to characterise investment behaviour in periods of economic turbulence. Design/methodology/approach The researchers considered a model of investment behaviour comprising six influencing factors. Inferential statistics through multiple linear regression was applied using the MATLAB R2014a software. The decision to invest was measured by the flow of new capital attracted by the fund (dependent variable) and the considered influencing factors (independent variables) were: the size of the fund, the risk associated to the fund, the growth of the fund, the growth of the fund category, the performance of the fund in its category. The research was conducted in Romania, Slovakia and Hungary. The period of study included the global economic crisis of 2007-2008. Findings The results illustrated that all considered factors do have an influence on the investment behaviour of investors in CEE, but with different levels of impact. The study concludes that the investment decision is partially knowledge-based, as investors in the region consider only some of the available information when making the decision to invest. Investment behaviour of investors in CEE is rather similar than dissimilar when deciding to invest in mutual funds. However, based on the differences between countries, it can be stated that the Hungarian investor is more mature and more informed than the others, when making investment decisions. Originality/value The study contributes to the exiting literature through the analysis of investment behaviour in young capital markets that are less studied in the literature. The limited number of studies considering mutual funds, usually comprise one fund category, while the present research considers all five most prevalent mutual funds categories for the studied period. It also contributed by collecting data from a less studied geographical region, CEE with three specific case studies, namely, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary that are looked at in a comparative manner.

TI  - The impact of anchoring bias on investment decision-making: evidence from Ghana
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The objective of this paper is to explore how anchoring affects the dynamics of investor decision-making with regard to mutual funds and how this bias differs amongst gender and level of financial knowledge. Design/methodology/approach An experimental research design was adopted to uncover the relationship between the variables under study; this involved the use of a questionnaire with an embedded experiment. Data obtained from the study were analysed using Pearson's chi-square test and two-way analysis of variance. Findings The findings show that, overall, investors were prone to be significantly influenced by the anchoring bias. The study finds a strong, albeit not significant, association between participants' susceptibility to anchor and both gender and the level of financial knowledge of participants. Females were observed to be more likely to anchor than their male counterparts. Also, a higher level of financial knowledge did not help to reduce the possibility of anchoring; it rather increased it. Research limitations/implications The findings of the study cannot be interpreted as suggesting causality as the study only tests for association between variables and not causality. Additionally, external validity cannot be fully established as a result of the quasi-experiment approach used. Practical implications The study adds to the body of knowledge on the influences of behavioural biases in the sub-region to make investors aware of their biases in order to minimise the influence of these biases on their investment decisions. Originality/value This study differs from earlier studies in that it analyses the presence of anchoring as influenced by a completely different set of variables (expertise and gender) and also does it within the context of an African country where there remains a paucity of research on behavioural finance.

TI  - The Impact of Financial Socialization and Financial Literacy on Financial Behaviors: An Empirical Study in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The research aims to evaluate college students' financial behavior and provide empirical insight into factors that may influence their financial behavior by investigating whether financial socialization, financial experience, and financial literacy are meaningful for students' financial behavior. The surveys data was conducted with 595 college students from all over Indonesia then analyzed using Structural Equation Model (SEM). The results demonstrate that financial socialization positively influences financial literacy and financial behavior. On the other hand, financial experience has a negative influence on financial literacy, yet a positive one on financial behavior. Furthermore, the result also shows financial socialization are the key determinant of financial literacy and financial literacy is vital and plays an essential role for financial behavior and it may derive from financial socialization and financial literacy. It indicates that the influence of social agents can benefit students in improving their financial literacy and behavior. However, experience also can influence their financial behaviors. The lack of experience of college students leads to inadequate financial knowledge and raises their risk of financial decisions. Students with sufficient financial knowledge and exhibiting good financial behavior can make wise decisions in financial planning and management, thus may prevent financial issues in the future.

TI  - Audit Committee Characteristics and Quality of Financial Information: The Role of the Internal Information Environment and Political Connections
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study explores the relationship between audit committee characteristics and accounting information quality by justifying the role of the internal information environment and political connections under the theocracy state of Iran with syncretic politics. Using panel data of 558 firms from the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) for 2011-2016, we rank firms using Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and entropy method for determination of the weight of evaluating indicators. The firms are positioned into high- to low-level political connections, and two proxies for audit committee characteristics are used: independence of audit committee and financial knowledge. Furthermore, three proxies are used for an internal information environment: earning announcement speed, the accuracy of earning forecasting and lack of financial restatements. Our findings show that there is a significant and positive relationship between the audit committee and financial information quality characteristics in high-level political connections, as well as between financial knowledge and financial information quality. Furthermore, the findings of this study suggest that the application of political economy theories could be appropriate for more inquiry.

TI  - Stereotypes in financial literacy: Evidence from PISA
T2  - JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE
AB  - We examine gender differences in financial literacy among high school students in Italy using data from the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Gender differences in financial literacy are large among the young in Italy. They are present in all regions and are particularly severe in the South and the Islands. Combining the rich PISA data with a variety of other indicators, we provide a thorough analysis of the potential determinants of the gender gap in financial literacy. We find that parental background, in particular the role of mothers, matters for the financial knowledge of girls. Moreover, we show that the social and cultural environment in which girls and boys live plays a crucial role in explaining gender differences. We also show that history matters: Medieval commercial hubs and the nuclear family structure created conditions favorable to the transformation of the role of women in society, and shaped gender differences in financial literacy as well. We discuss the changes that are needed to close the gap in financial knowledge among the young.

TI  - Collaborating for innovation: The inhibiting role of constraints
T2  - JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB  - There is a growing recognition that firms increase their collaboration breadth by opening their boundaries to more innovation partners, sourcing and integrating complementary knowledge, skills, and resources and, in turn, improving their innovation performance. However, not all firms benefit equally from collaboration breadth. We argue that the literature has not considered important contingency factors that can mitigate such benefits. This paper enhances understanding of the relationship between collaboration breadth and innovation performance by contending, and empirically confirming, that the magnitude and direction of this association depend on the type of constraints the firm faces. Drawing on organizational learning theory, it is argued that firms encountering financial, knowledge, and institutional innovation constraints will compromise the effects of their openness. The empirical findings suggest that innovative firms face challenges balancing trade-offs between a broad collaboration network and high financial, knowledge, and institutional constraints.

TI  - Analysing the Predictors of Financial Stress and Financial Well-Being among the Bottom 40 Percent (B40) Households in Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This paper aims to analyse factors affecting financial stress among the Bottom 40 Percent (B40) group of Malaysian households, reflecting overall financial well-being. Data were collected through questionnaires from 1008 respondents across five major regions in Malaysia. The data were analysed using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). This study provides evidence that financial behaviour, financial vulnerability (debt and income), and locus of control (luck and self-confidence) significantly affect financial stress among B40 households. The results show a significantly positive relationship between financial stress with financial vulnerability (debt and income) and locus of control (self-confidence). On the contrary, financial behaviour and locus of control (luck) show a significant negative relationship with financial stress. The result also indicates that financial stress affects financial well-being. Overall, the findings indicate that policy-makers should invent more effective and substantial stimulus packages or other measures to reduce the financial burden on B40 households. The findings could eventually provide insights for future research to delve into the social impact of financial stress. This study also has established a valid and reliable instrument to measure financial stress involving B40 households in Malaysia that eventually reflects the financial well-being of this group of people.

TI  - Covid-19 and the changing face of financial literacy in India : Evidence from Delhi NCR during lockdowns
T2  - JOURNAL OF STATISTICS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
AB  - With a change in global market entanglement and composite retail financial products, financial literacy has gained distinction in the recent past. More importantly, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought attention to the preparation of individuals' financial budgets for unforeseen losses. As a result, financial literacy has gained immense importance. Literature available on the subject suggests that individuals when faced with a situation of crisis, tend to reduce their risk of not paying the liabilities, by controlling their budget. This research article aims to understand whether or not individuals with a good understanding of financial literacy have better skills in financial management, particularly during lockdowns. Primary data was collected after the second phase of lockdowns in August 2021 from 232 individuals residing in Delhi NCR, using a questionnaire adapted from the OECD study. Besides, a scale was developed to understand their financial behaviour and financial management skills. The results of the study indicate that a good understanding of financial principles helped manage financial risk effectively and avoid any financial pitfalls. It helps individuals avoid financial concerns and enable individuals to regulate their income, even in challenging conditions like the Covid-19 pandemic.

TI  - A Longitudinal Study of the Skills and Attitudes Conveyed by Two Business Simulation Games in Pecs, Hungary
T2  - SIMULATION & GAMING
AB  - Background. Business simulation games have been used since 1979 at the University of Pecs. Since 2000, two games have been taught: a green business simulation developed on site and known as BUSINESS SIMULATION CHALLENGE and the MULTINATIONAL MANAGEMENT GAME. In this research we report on a longitudinal study of the results of the two business simulations; and investigate the effects of the Green Business simulation.
   Method. This survey-based research included 329 students that completed a questionnaire on business simulations since 2000. Surveys were carried out to measure the effect of the two simulations. There are data from three periods up to recent years. Frequency tables, univariate ANCOVA, T-tests and cross tabulation were used to analyse the data.
   Results.
   - Generations' attitudes and skills do not change with the passage of time, and the skills and knowledge, conveyed by the simulations can be considered as constant throughout the period.
   - This study confirms that main managerial skills are developed with simulation games but there is no need for enhanced mathematical and financial knowledge.
   -The green simulation successfully developed the green attitude of students, but only in cases where the green option was rational.
   - More educated students enjoy greater challenges, namely the need for deeper analysis.
   -Simulation courses in universities provide a higher level of motivation than do commercial simulations.
   Conclusion.
   It can be stated that almost the same results can be achieved by general purpose simulations which have a different focus (analytical or strategy-oriented game). Results also indicate that more simulation courses in universities would stimulate higher student motivation.

TI  - Psychological beliefs and financial well-being among working adults: the mediating role of financial behaviour
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Purpose This study aimed to assess the impact of psychological beliefs (subjective financial knowledge, financial attitude and locus of control) on financial well-being, as well as the mediating role of financial behaviour in the relationship between psychological beliefs and financial well-being among working adults in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach A survey-based questionnaire was used to elicit information from a total of 500 working adults from Malaysia. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to assess the measurement model and the proposed mediation model. Findings The results showed that subjective financial knowledge, financial attitude and locus of control have a positive impact on both financial behaviour and financial well-being. The results also showed that financial behaviour mediates the relationships between financial attitude and financial well-being, as well as between locus of control and financial well-being. Originality/value Given the anticipated global economic recession, a better understanding of how individuals manage their finances becomes ever more crucial. The findings from this research inform policymakers, practitioners and academics on the importance of psychological factors and financial management practices on financial well-being, addressing an identified gap in the current literature.

TI  - An enigma of Malaysia's low-income young adults: Mediation of financial behaviour on financial well-being and locus of control cohesion
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Young adults face many significant challenges to their financial well-being. The rising cost of living and unstable economies have impacted how they consume, manage, and save monthly income to maintain their standard of living. Hence, exploring the financial well-being of young adults in Malaysia is an intriguing and relevant research topic that deserves examination from multiple perspectives. This study aims to investigate how these three factors, namely financial knowledge and locus of control with financial behaviour as a mediator, are correlated with the financial well-being of low-income young adults in Malaysia. A total of 520 young adults from North, Central, South, East zones in Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia were randomly chosen using a multi-stage sampling technique as the sample of this study. Data in this study were obtained using a set of questionnaire-based survey through cross-sectional study and then scrutinized using IBM SPSS (Statistical Package of Social Science). This study discovered that financial knowledge, internal and external locus of control, and financial behaviour were significantly correlated with the financial well-being of low-income young adults. The findings also demonstrate that financial behaviour mediates the correlation between financial knowledge, both internal and external locus of control, and financial well-being. This study is one of the very few important studies that explore the link between financial literacy, locus of control, financial behaviour, and financial well-being among low-income young adults. This study also found an interesting and noteworthy fact regarding the impact of the minimum monthly wage policy on highly educated young adults in Malaysia, which is worth discussing and needs to be alerted to the policymakers and leaders of the country. Therefore, the findings of this study can be utilized as a starting point by policymakers, government organizations, and non-governmental organizations to create new initiatives aimed at raising financial well-being among the younger generation.

TI  - Determinants of financial literacy of young adults: testing the influence of parents and socio-demographic variables
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIAN CULTURE AND BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Acquiring good financial literacy (FL) can be very helpful for a young adult, as it may allow for making informed choices and long-term financial decisions. The research evidence suggests that in general people are less financially literate, which becomes an impediment to making the right form of savings, investment, retirement planning and other such important decisions. The objective of the study is to identify what determines the level of FL of young adults undertaking a management program in India. This study, in addition, examines the effect of parental influence by including three facets of it; namely, parents direct teaching, parents' financial behaviour and parents as role models. Notably, parents' influence is a significant determinant of FL. Among other factors, higher FL was found for male respondents, those with more educated mother, and finance majors.

T2  - JOURNAL OF LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION
AB  - Financial literacy (FL) is an important ability needed by any individual to understand, evaluate, and communicate business and financial information. Having accurate financial information increases ones competency to be financial literate. It is regarded as a common and basic life skill that libraries can develop for their users. Using purposive sampling, this study ponders into the status and challenges of eight public city libraries in the Philippines in terms of providing FL education and how they can potentially share a role in developing the economy of a country. Public libraries' readiness to serve their users can be observed in terms of their collection, web presence, services, and programs. The level of financial knowledge and competencies of city librarians were also assessed. A look into the available professional development programs for public librarians in business and finance librarianship was reviewed.

TI  - Financial Education in School of Business Students: Case Study from Veracruz, Mexico
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The purpose of the study is to evaluate the knowledge level and behavior that business school students from Veracruz, Mexico have in relation to interest rates, inflation, savings, credit and budgeting. For the empirical study, a non-experimental quantitative cross-sectioned and descriptive design was followed. The test used was that of Moreno-Garcia et al. (2017), which was answered by 309 undergraduate students from Veracruz, Mexico. Data measurement was performed using descriptive statistics, cross tables and the non-parametric test of proportions (Z). The main findings point to the fact that more students understand well the impact of inflation than the relationship between interest rates and bonds; that students do not consider that saving provides financial security; and that there is no gender difference in terms of saving behavior. Most of the business school students do not have a credit card, prefer debit cards and have acceptable practices in budget planning. In summary, the results of this study show a good level of financial knowledge in relation to interest rates, inflation, investment, credit, and show adequate behavior of savings and credit card, as well as the use of the budgets. However, it was expected that each item would have a greater number of correct answers, considering that the population under study has received training in mathematics, economics, and finance. It is noteworthy that, in relation to gender, there are more men who correctly answer the questions about inflation and it is women who have better practices in the use of their credit cards.

TI  - Financial literacy and its influence on internet banking behavior
T2  - EUROPEAN MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - This paper presents the survey results for financial literacy among Cypriot adults and reports their financial aptitude and behaviour. Additionally, it investigates for the first time the implications of financial literacy on respondents' usage of digital financial services, particularly internet banking (i-banking). The focus is on Cyprus, a country that experienced an unprecedented financial crisis in 2013 that resulted in a bail-in and an enormous subsequent shrinkage of the banking sector. Cypriot con-sumers face an ever-increasing need for financial sophistication to effectively utilise and manage digital banking services. Neverthless, financial literacy is still low in Cyprus, whereby only 37.33% of survey respondents showed proficiency in financial knowledge. The findings indicate that there is a statistically positive relationship between the levels of financial knowledge and the frequency of i-banking use. More importantly, financially illiterate consumers appear to report far more often than their financially literate peers the lack of trust in i-banking, as well as a lack of self-confidence in financial and digital skills as the main reasons for not using this service. The findings highlight the interplay between financial literacy and digital proficiency, and their implication on individuals' use of i-banking services. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing the impact of financial education programs: A quantitative model
T2  - ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW
AB  - Prior studies disagree regarding the effectiveness of financial education programs, especially those offered in the workplace. To explain such measurement differences in evaluation and outcomes, we employ a stochastic life cycle model with endogenous financial knowledge accumulation and investigate how financial education programs optimally shape key economic outcomes. This approach permits us to measure how such programs shape wealth accumulation, financial knowledge, and participation in sophisticated assets (e.g. stocks) across heterogeneous consumers. We apply conventional program evaluation econometric techniques to simulated data, distinguishing selection and treatment effects. We show that the more effective programs provide follow-up in order to sustain the knowledge acquired by employees via the program; in such an instance, financial education delivered to employees around the age of 40 can raise savings at retirement by close to 10%. By contrast, one-time education programs do produce short-term but few long-term effects. We also measure how accounting for selection affects estimates of program effectiveness for those who participate. Comparisons of participants and non-participants can be misleading, even using a difference-in-difference strategy when the common-trend assumption is unlikely to hold. Random program assignment is needed to evaluate program effects on those who participate.

TI  - Orthopaedic Surgery Resident Financial Literacy: An Assessment of Knowledge in Debt, Investment, and Retirement Savings
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
CP  - Meeting of the American-Orthopaedic-Association
AB  - Most orthopedic residents carry significant debt and may enter their practice with little knowledge of business management, minimal retirement savings, and overall poor financial literacy. This study aimed to gauge financial literacy, debt, and retirement planning in United States orthopedic surgery residents. Willingness to participate in formalized financial education was also assessed. Eighty-five allopathic orthopedic surgery residents in the United States completed a 14-question anonymous online survey in 2016. The survey assessed demographic data, self-assessed financial knowledge, amount of credit card debt and loans, preparation for retirement, and willingness to participate in formal didactic education on these topics. Most respondents derive their financial knowledge from personal research (51%), whereas only 4 per cent have a formal curriculum. Despite most respondents reporting more than $200,000 in outstanding loans, only 31 per cent create and stick to a budget. Few programs offer retirement advice, and 48 per cent of respondents save $0 toward retirement. Eighty-five per cent of residents expressed interest in learning about personal investment, savings, and retirement planning. Orthopedic surgery residents carry significant debt and do not achieve their high-income potential until disproportionately later in life. Only 4 per cent of residents have formal training in investing, personal finance, or retirement despite a majority who desire such a curriculum. In fact, almost 75 per cent of those surveyed felt less prepared for retirement than their peers outside of medical training.

TI  - Role of Parental Financial Socialisation on Financial Literacy among Youth
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The purpose of the study is to investigate the role of parental financial socialization on the financial literacy among the youth between the age group of 15-24. The study analyzed four variables of parental financial socialization on the financial literacy. Parental financial socialization is the deliberate process of bringing up the children in such a way that the financial knowledge, skills and attitude is being transferred, which may reflect in their financial behavior and outcomes. These variables were identified based on the relationship exhibited, financial decision making, teaching method adopted and responsiveness that the parent and child may share. As it is evident from the existing literatures that parental financial socialization is identified as the primary factor which influences the financial knowledge and behavior of any individual, the effort was made to focus on the younger generation based on the selected variables namely financial teaching and monitoring, financial budgeting, parental relationship and parental responsiveness. Financial literacy plays a vital role in the capital formation, thereby leading to productive investments and ultimately to the economic development of the country. Financial literacy has three dimensions, which includes financial knowledge, attitude and behavior. The study only focused on the awareness and attitude of the youth based on the family socialization.The data was randomly collected from 100 respondents by framing a structured questionnaire from the state of Kerala.The data analysis was doneon the parental influence to the financial literacy by conducting regression analysis on financial literacy and the four variables of parental financial socialization. It was found that the financial teaching and monitoring is not having a significant relationship with financial literacy. It was also found that, the most influencing variables being parental relationship with their children and family budgeting by the involvement of the youth.The overall effect of the variables on the financial literacy was made by using multiple linear regression. The results indicate that the four variables under the study are not much explaining their effect on the financial literacy, as such the inference is drawn as parental socialization factors have no significant effect on the financial literacy among the youth. The financial literacy and its effect on the demographic variables like gender, educational qualification and employment status was made. The result from the study indicated that male youth were more inclined to financial knowledge than the counterpart. But the Mann Whitney U test indicates that there is no gender difference. The educational qualification possessed by the youth does not indicate a positive relationship with the literacy. It was found that the financial literacy is different among the employed youth and the unemployed youth.One third of the sample indicated that they were unaware of the importance of savings as they were not motivated by their parents to make them save, when they were between the age of 8-15. The study tries to shed some lights on the increasing need for parental involvement in bringing up the youth so as to make them more inclined to savings and investment.

TI  - Augmented reality (AR)-based sharia financial literacy system (AR-SFLS): a new approach to virtual sharia financial socialization for young learners
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC AND MIDDLE EASTERN FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose This study aims to examine financial socialization based on augmented reality (AR) technology for elementary school students, which it is hoped will improve their sharia financial knowledge. Design/methodology/approach The experimental method with pre- and post-test and control groups was used to test the improvement in the young learners' sharia financial knowledge. This study used AR for sharia financial socialization on elementary school students and focused on sharia's basic concepts, which include earning money, balanced spending, borrowing, saving, investment, payment methods, financial technology and the concept of protection. Findings This study finds empirical evidence that the treatment group, who received sharia financial socialization via the AR media, increased their sharia financial knowledge to a greater extent than the control group did. Research limitations/implications This study provides encouraging evidence about the potential of sharia financial education for elementary school students using the appropriate learning strategies and media. The weakness in this study is that it was only carried out in one elementary school, with the children of middle- to upper-income parents. Further research should be undertaken at several schools with the children of parents with different income levels. Practical implications A shift in learning styles from verbal or visual to virtual encourages the use of AR-based learning media. Financial concepts can be abstract ones, and AR-based learning media is able to present intangible virtual elements so they become more concrete and tangible. Social implications The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects. One of the most severe and likely to be multiyear ahead is the financial aspect. Therefore, this research is expected to be a preparation for the younger generation as early as possible to strengthen social benefits in order to improve sharia financial literacy. Originality/value Research into the financial literacy, especially sharia financial literacy aimed at elementary school students, is still very limited. The teaching of financial literacy will be more effective if educators use the appropriate strategies and media. This study used financial socialization strategies and AR learning media that are aligned with the learning styles of young learners.

TI  - Barriers to innovation and firm productivity
T2  - ECONOMICS OF INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The paper analyzes the effect of financial, knowledge, demand, market structure and regulation barriers to innovation on firms' economic performance. It contributes to the literature on barriers to innovation by accounting for the heterogeneous effects that each barrier has on firms across the productivity distribution. We do so by employing both quantile regression techniques and matching estimators on this UK CIS panel 2002-2010 merged with the Business Structure Database. While we find evidence that both the cost and also the availability of finance negatively affect productivity across the whole distribution, the lack of qualified personnel mostly hinders high productivity firms. Moreover, quantile regression reveals some interesting variation in effect sizes across the (conditional) productivity distribution.

TI  - Factors Associated With Electronic Banking Adoption
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - Using data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, this study investigates factors that affect electronic banking adoption rates. Financial knowledge, income, education, and credit card ownership are associated with a high probability of electronic banking adoption. However, age is negatively associated with the probability of online banking adoption and the African American consumer is less likely to adopt electronic banking. This result is more prominent for African American women but does not hold for African American business owners. Financial counselors, planners, and educators should be aware and sensitive to these differences in order to provide additional education as needed on how to effectively use electronic banking services in order to achieve a greater degree of financial inclusion.

TI  - An institutional view on access to finance by Tanzanian women-owned enterprises
T2  - VENTURE CAPITAL
AB  - We investigate the limited use of bank and microfinance loans by Tanzanian female entrepreneurs. Using survey data, we observe that female entrepreneurs mainly use informal sources to finance their businesses. We analyze how "perceptions" of gendered cognitive and normative institutions determine whether a female entrepreneur applies for a formal loan. Following results stand out: first, we find that high collateral requirements, interest rates and personal guarantee requirements make formal loans unattractive. Second, female entrepreneurs only apply when they expect to be successful. Since they "perceive" access to finance to be more problematic for women, female entrepreneurs are discouraged from applying. Third, female entrepreneurs "perceive" they have insufficient access to financial knowledge which again will prevent them from applying. This study contributes to theory by exploring the effect of entrepreneurs' perceptions of the institutional business environment on financing behavior. Furthermore, we show that the low use of formal loans by female entrepreneurs is primarily demand-driven, which calls into question the effectivity of policy recommendations aiming to increase supply of formal loans.

TI  - What does 'Big Three' tell us about retirement planning skills?
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - In this paper, we present the results of financial knowledge assessment from a nationwide survey carried out in Poland in 2019. To measure this phenomenon, we use the well-grounded scale, the 'Big Three' financial literacy questions, proposed by Mitchell and Lusardi. The results are similar to those of studies in other countries. However, we find that financial literacy scores poorly predict reasonable answers to the retirement planning question. We present hypotheses to explain this finding and recommend potential solutions.

TI  - Financial Literacy Externalities
T2  - REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB  - We use unique administrative data and a quasi-field experiment of exogenous allocation in Sweden to estimate medium- and longer-run effects of peoples' exposure to financially literate neighbors on their financial behavior. We contribute evidence of (1) a causal impact of exposure and of a social multiplier of financial knowledge and (2) unfavorable distributional aspects of externalities. Exposure promotes saving in private retirement accounts and stockholding, especially when neighbors have economics or business education, but only for educated households and for substantial interaction possibilities. Findings point to a transfer of knowledge rather than mere imitation or effects through labor, education, or mobility channels.

TI  - Financial Literacy and portfolio diversification: Evidence from Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPETITIVENESS
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the level of financial knowledge and portfolio diversification in Vietnam, an emerging financial market in Asia. To achieve this objective, we conducted an online survey of 343 investors actively participating in Vietnam's financial markets in 2020. The survey's primary goal was to assess both basic and advanced knowledge levels among investors in the field of finance, as well as their foundational grasp of economics. To gauge the extent of portfolio diversification among these investors, we included questions pertaining to the number of stocks and financial assets comprising their portfolios. The results of ordinary least squares and Probit regressions reveal a significant correlation between investors' financial knowledge and the extent of their portfolio diversification in Vietnam. Notably, comprehension of concepts such as the time value of money within digital currencies, financial assets, and risk measurement emerges as a pivotal factor influencing portfolio diversification levels. However, there is no significant relationship found between knowledge of economics and portfolio diversification. Furthermore, investors' personal circumstances, including their job positions and income, can also exert an influence on the degree of portfolio diversification they undertake. These findings underscore the importance of enhancing investors' understanding of financial products, as doing so can bolster competitiveness and serve as an effective means of enhancing the efficiency of Vietnam's financial markets. In light of these results, investors and policymakers should consider implementing measures aimed at adapting to market requirements, thereby fostering sustainable development.

TI  - Urbanization and financial literacy: the knowledge spillover effect
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - Using the dataset of the 2015 wave of the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS), this paper examines how urbanization influences individuals' financial literacy. We demonstrate that the financial knowledge of urban natives spills to rural-urban migrants in the process of urbanization and urban agglomeration. We address the potential endogeneity issue by taking advantage of China's land expropriation policy. Our results are robust to identification regressions and a series of robustness checks. Further mechanism analysis shows that the financial literacy spillover effect works mainly through social networks.

TI  - Does financial literacy drive entrepreneurship in rural China?
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Developing financial literacy is a crucial part of entrepreneurship. It can aid aspiring entrepreneurs to learn how to analyze market trends, formulate business plans, conduct cost accounting activities, and navigate fiscal risks in their businesses. Therefore, we investigated the most recent dataset on rural residents in China to determine the effects of financial literacy on their entrepreneurial behaviors. Our observations reveal that individuals with high financial literacy, that is, those who have attained advanced financial knowledge, are more likely to start a business than those with low financial literacy. We employed instrumental variable analysis to mitigate the endogeneity of financial literacy. Results show a causal relationship between Chinese rural residents' financial literacy and entrepreneurship. Finally, we demonstrate that the aggressive risk attitudes of rural families magnify the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurship.

TI  - A Structural Determinants Framework for Financial Well-Being
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - This study develops a conceptual framework that provides a broad understanding of financial well-being. Using the 2018 National Financial Capability Study and structural equation modeling methods, this study provides empirical evidence for the proposed framework by identifying significant direct and indirect determinants of financial well-being. Previous personal financial wellness and financial satisfaction-related research provides a theoretical rationale for the construction of the conceptual framework in the current study. The results reported the relationships among these determinants, including financial perceptions and knowledge factors, financial stress, short- and long-term positive financial behavior, and financial satisfaction. The findings indicate that financial satisfaction, short-term financial behavior, perceived financial capability showed positive and direct associations with financial well-being, whereas financial stress and long-term financial behavior were negatively and directly associated with financial well-being. Financial perception and knowledge factors, financial stress, and short-term financial behavior also showed significant indirect relationships with financial well-being. The findings of this study contribute to the literature on financial well-being and provide significant policy and practical implications. Implications for financial practitioners and policy makers are discussed.

AB  - We study a quasi-natural experiment that altered the structure of commission fee schedules applied to retail investors in the Portuguese stock market in 2003. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we show that investors with a university degree, financial knowledge and numerical skills demonstrate greater ability and eagerness in adjusting their trading patterns to the new commission schedules. The impact of education was stronger for those lacking trading experience. Investors with a university degree that were more prone to issue small orders before the event were also more eager to scale up their order size.

T2  - EDUCATION ECONOMICS
AB  - We evaluate whether a scalable online teacher professional development (OTPD) module that requires little time investment enhances students' financial literacy. Two randomised controlled trials were performed, with 1827 students, 53 teachers and 47 schools participating. The financial education programme on its own increased students' financial knowledge, but did not improve financial behaviour. Regarding the OTPD effects, we observed that students' knowledge scores did not significantly improve, but that behaviour scores were enhanced relative to students whose teachers did not receive access to the OTPD module. In comparison with students in the control condition, behaviour scores improved with 0.39 SD.

Based on primary data, the paper shows that transnational, transcultural alliances forged through skills of mediation and compromise among the city's Islamic talents and Shariah scholars favourably connect separate economic and cultural spheres of knowledge.

AB  - This paper studies the role of individuals' confidence in own financial literacy in explaining the gender gap in investment in risky assets, while controlling for actual financial literacy and risk aversion. It is the first paper to assess the role of confidence independent of actual financial knowledge for a large set of countries and it is the first to explore the role of confidence by using counterfactual decomposition techniques. Results from our analysis confirm recent findings of modern behavioral finance: confidence is a strong determinant of risky financial behavior and accounts for a large part of the gender gap.

TI  - Credit cards and commercial insurance participation: Evidence from urban households in China
T2  - ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB  - The diffusion of credit cards may have relaxed households' liquidity constraints, thereby stimulating the diffusion of commercial insurance. By investigating Chinese urban households who had no commercial insurance in 2013, we find that their initial access to credit cards significantly increased the likelihood of their holding commercial insurance in 2015. Our instrumental variable (IV) estimations confirm the causality. This positive effect is more pronounced among more liquidity-constrained households and among households with more financial knowledge. Last, the initial access to credit cards also significantly enhanced commercial insurance renewal in 2015 among those households who had commercial insurance in 2013.

TI  - The effect of audit committee attributes and gender diversity on audit quality
T2  - JOURNAL FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The overreliance on the audit committee's (AC) financial knowledge solely to enhance its oversight role is detrimental to corporate governance practices. The evidence about the effect of other characteristics that can be crucial for the efficiency of the AC, which affects audit and financial statements quality, is lacking. The study aims to explore the influence of AC members' independence, the involvement of female executives, and the specific characteristics of the French business landscape on the quality of audits. In this investigation, 930 data points were analysed, drawn from a selection of 93 French companies listed on the SBF 120 index over a decade, spanning from 2012 to 2021. The research reveals that while AC independence positively contributes to audit quality, the expertise of committee members and gender diversity have a significant adverse effect on audit quality. This may have implications for decision-makers in France as well as in other nations with similar institutional environments that they should consider when developing future regulatory reforms.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND SOCIETY
AB  - This study aims at investigating the financial knowledge, financial behaviour and the attitude towards finance amongst on small medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) in Kuching. More specifically on how these powerful factors affect the profitability on fast growing business enterprises in largest city in the Borneo Island over the last decade. The research takes a descriptive approach fitting its underlying pursue and draws interesting conclusions with over 75% response rate. Analysis of the data collected clearly reveals that the knowledge of finance in general relates significantly stronger to the bottom line of these business entities relative to the owners' financial attitude and their ensuing behaviour towards financial decision making. Therefore, small medium entrepreneurs are highly recommended to participate in financial education on a regular basis to keep them well informed and equipped with the latest ways of managing the finances of their businesses to ensure better financial planning, execution and monitoring of enterprises that inevitably will lead to increased and sustainable earnings.

TI  - A partial least squares approach to the financing behaviour of micro, small and medium enterprises
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURING
AB  - The present study explores the financing behaviour of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) owners. A nexus of owners' personal attributes (PC) and behavioural aspects including financial knowledge (FK), financing motivation (M), and risk taking ability (R) has been created to determine the financing preferences (FP) and capital structure decision (CSD) of firm owners. The research framework adopts quantitative approach to the analysis. 274 responses were collected and analysed through partial least squares structural equation modelling on SmartPLSv2. The findings support the direct and mediating role of M and R in predicting FP and its relationship with PC. Moreover, the study confirms the role of FP in determining CSD in terms of pecking order behaviour among firm owners. The integration of owners' personal characteristics and behavioural factors in determining firms' financial decision adds value to the theory and practice of MSME financing.

AB  - This study investigates the essential characteristics of the personal financial landscape of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Saudi Arabia, with a specific focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 154 respondents, comprising owners, managers, and administrators of Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, were surveyed to gather data. The results of the study indicate that younger entrepreneurs and businesses experienced greater financial consequences, particularly among owners aged 18-30 and 31-45, compared to older age groups. However, both younger and older entrepreneurs demonstrated a higher level of financial knowledge and awareness regarding emergency finance options. Overall, the outbreak had a significant impact on both the national and global economies. This study offers a significant contribution to the extant body of literature pertaining to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).

TI  - A comparative analysis of financial literacy levels and initiatives among students in five European countries
T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB  - Given the expected advantages for individuals and societies, financial literacy is high on the policy agenda in many countries. This paper reports the results from a unique survey conducted on a sample of 13-16-year-old students in five European countries, aimed at measuring and comparing their level of financial literacy skills. The results indicate significant differences in the level of financial literacy across countries that are interpreted in the light of the differences in the countries' educational policies and experiences with financial education. The findings suggest that supra-national coordinated action is needed to guarantee better financial knowledge and safeguard economic stability in future crises.

TI  - Financial literacy, household portfolio choice and investment return
T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - Based on data from the 2014 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), this paper investigates the effects of financial literacy on Chinese households' portfolio choices and investment returns from the financial market. We find that financial literacy significantly increases households' investments in risky assets. Financial literacy may have an impact by increasing capacities to understand and compare financial assets. However, we further find that it is not necessary for all investors to have financial knowledge to gain higher investment returns from financial markets. Our results show that financial literacy increases investment returns for younger and better educated households while reducing the returns for older, less educated households.

TI  - Do heuristics matter for financial literacy? The impact of better heuristics awareness to financial literacy
T2  - FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Policymakers are increasingly focused on improving citizens' financial well-being through better financial literacy. Traditional strategies emphasize financial education to boost financial knowledge, while recently behavioural-based education focus on issues like behavioural biases and emotional influences. This paper suggests a randomized controlled-study to assess if financial education including lessons on heuristics (availability and gambler's fallacy) enhances financial literacy. Results showed that traditional financial education significantly improved financial literacy, while adding heuristics had effect close to zero. This suggests expanding curricula to address rules-of-thumb may not necessarily improve financial literacy, challenging the notion that more complex financial education is always beneficial.

TI  - Do confident individuals generally work harder?
T2  - JOURNAL OF MULTINATIONAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Predicting worker's effort is important in many different areas, but is often difficult. Using a laboratory experiment, we test the hypothesis that confidence, i.e. person-specific beliefs about her abilities, can be used as a generic proxy to predict effort provision. We measure confidence in the domain of financial knowledge in three different ways (self-assessed knowledge, probability-based confidence, and incentive-compatible confidence) and find a positive relation with the actual provision of effort in an unrelated domain. Additional analysis shows that the findings are independent of personal traits such as gender, age, and nationality. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The ABCs of Financial Education: Experimental Evidence on Attitudes, Behavior, and Cognitive Biases
T2  - MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB  - This paper uses a large-scale field experiment in India to study attitudinal, behavioral, and cognitive constraints that can stymie the link between financial education and financial outcomes. The study complements financial education with (i) financial incentives on a financial literacy test to affect participant motivation, (ii) financial goal setting to provide a psychological nudge, and (iii) personalized financial counseling to enhance the intensity of treatment. The analysis finds no impact of financial incentives on learning but significant effects of both goal setting and counseling on real financial outcomes. These results identify important complements to financial education that can bridge the gap between financial knowledge and behavior change.

TI  - Provincial Marketization and Individual Financial Literacy in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE PSYCHOLOGY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - In the past decades, China has experienced a process of marketization, but the levels of marketization in each province are imbalanced. The present research examines how provincial-level marketization predicts individual-level financial literacy in China by investigating a nationally representative sample with a set of standardized financial literacy tests. The results showed a positive association with a diminishing return between marketization and the Homo economicus index of financial literacy, including financial knowledge, financial capacity, and financial management values. Furthermore, there was a U-shaped relationship between marketization and the Homo sociologicus index of financial literacy, including wealth values and financial ethics. The findings not only contribute to understanding the nonmonotonic roles of marketization on different facets of financial literacy but also point to an institutional avenue for policymakers and practitioners interested in improving individual financial literacy.

TI  - New Schemes for Investment in of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises of China: Role of Access to Finance, Innovation, and Sustainability
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Firm innovation relies heavily on financing, which is why it is a hot topic in the fields of finance and innovation management. Organizations can make strategic investments in production factors to develop competitive advantages because they have access to financial resources. This study investigated how financial literacy, innovativeness, and environmental sustainability influence the sustainability of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This was set as the primary objective in order to better understand the nature of the impact of financial literacy and innovation on the sustainability of SME firms. To test the hypotheses, structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied using data collected from 300 small businesses firms in China. The results revealed that financial literacy and innovativeness significantly influence small firms' sustainability. Additionally, social inclusion significantly affects small firms' sustainability, and sequentially has a significant effect on their performance. Research findings suggested that small businesses incorporate sustainability models into their operations and enhance financial knowledge in order to maintain sustainability.

TI  - Talking money at home: the value of family financial socialization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The objective of this study was to empirically examine how family financial socialization affects individuals' financial outcomes, including financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being, based on the family financial socialization theory (FFST). Design/methodology/approach Using a national representative sample of 6,311 US respondents from the 2016 National Financial Well-Being Survey, structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test the hypotheses in this study. Sampling weights were incorporated into the structural model using the maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors and a Satorra-Bentler scaled test statistic (MLM estimation). Findings This study concludes the effectiveness of family financial socialization by showing that parental financial socialization has significant positive impacts on financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being. In addition, parents' education can significantly influence the quality of parental financial socialization. Practical implications The result underscores the importance of financial socialization in the family context and encourages parents to discuss financial matters with their children at home. Detailed implications have been provided to financial educators, practitioners and policymakers to incorporate parental involvement in the design of financial education programs, as well as financial services providers to improve marketing strategies for their banking services. Originality/value This research is amongst the first to empirically explore the relationships among parental financial socialization, financial literacy, financial behavior and financial well-being based on the FFST. The study also contributes to the literature by confirming the effects of parental socialization received in childhood on adults' later financial outcomes.

TI  - Finance and sustainability: From ideology to utopia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - This paper is based on the observation that there is a contradiction between the current demands for sustainability and the way the financial system works. Beginning with a discussion of the epistemological assumptions underlying financial theory, it seeks to show how it may be viewed as an Ideology for the financialization of economies and societies. We use the Ricoeurian notion of the cultural imagination to develop a counterpoint Utopia, which we call Finance As A Common. The reflexivity enabled by this Utopia reveals the mental structures in which financial actors are embedded. It also allows us to plot possible pathways for the reconstruction of the financial system, including local currencies, and the renewal of financial knowledge.

TI  - Cryptocurrencies have arrived, but are we ready? Unveiling cryptocurrency adoption recipes through an SEM-fsQCA approach
T2  - BOTTOM LINE
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate consumers' cryptocurrency adoption through the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and complexity theory. Design/methodology/approachBy using a purposive sampling method, a configurational model was developed and a questionnaire-based survey was conducted to gather responses from a Malaysian sample. A total of 223 responses were obtained. Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) were adopted to analyze the data. FindingsThe PLS-SEM indicated that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and affinity for technology interaction were positive cryptocurrency adoption predictors, whereas regulation was a negative predictor. Based on the fsQCA, cryptocurrency adoption could be explained by six configurational paths, which comprised combinations of the proposed causal conditions: the UTAUT factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating condition and social influence), environmental factor (regulation) and individual factors (financial knowledge and affinity for technology interaction). Research limitations/implicationsThis study offers contributions to the theoretical body of knowledge by articulating the relevance of extended UTAUT and extending the established UTAUT model by integrating external environment and personal factors, also showing the linear and nonlinear interplays of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, regulation, financial knowledge and affinity for technology interaction. Practical implicationsThe findings facilitated practitioners' (cryptocurrency brokers, governments and businesses) fostering of cryptocurrency adoption through the joint consideration of different factors. The factors spanned technological attributes and individual characteristics to regulation. Practitioners should acknowledge that different combinations of the aforementioned antecedents can be equally effective to increase cryptocurrency adoption. The findings suggested that these causal conditions should be considered holistically and that there is no best predictor. Social implicationsIn social terms, the research is expected to contribute to the dissemination of cryptocurrencies and help governments and central banks to develop, regulate and supervise digital currencies, as well as in the implementation of a digital currency ecosystem aligned with sustainable development goals. Economically, the results might foster a high cryptocurrency adoption rate and stimulate crypto-token-based business models and investment opportunities that present new means of revenue generation at individual, organizational and national levels. Originality/valueThis study offers unique perspectives for the body of knowledge and practice in the cryptocurrency domain, using both symmetric and asymmetric methodologies, by delineating the configurational logic involving technological capabilities, social influences, regulation and individual characteristics in facilitating more efficacious dissemination of cryptocurrencies.

AB  - The Test of Financial Literacy (TFL) was created to measure the financial knowledge of high school students. Its content is based on the standards and benchmarks stated in the National Standards for Financial Literacy (Council for Economic Education 2013). The test development process involved extensive item writing and review. Test data collected from 1,218 high schools to evaluate the measure indicate that the overall test is reliable and valid, and test items contribute to the effectiveness of the instrument. Further test analysis was conducted using an item response theory (IRT) model with four parameters to estimate item discrimination, item difficulty, guessing, and inattention. The IRT results indicate that the measure is effective in assessing student financial literacy across a broad range of student abilities.

This research utilized Bandura's Triadic Model of Causation (Bandura, 1985) to investigate and predict responsible financial behaviors. Data from the 2009, 2012, and 2018 National Financial Capability Study surveys were used to construct a responsible financial behaviors index with five subconstructs for time horizon, money management, risk management, debt awareness, and ownership of baseline financial accounts. Results from a series of regression models identified consistent relationships between the index and variables categorized as cognitive factors (financial knowledge, financial self-efficacy, and financial risk tolerance) and background characteristics (educational attainment, income, and marital status).

TI  - The Ant and the Grasshopper: Understanding Personal Saving Orientation of Consumers
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB  - A low savings rate is a persistent social issue with significant present and future ramifications. As an alternative to conceptualizing saving money as goal-directed behavior, the present research examines the chronic tendencies of people to save money in a consistent and sustained manner through a personal saving orientation (PSO). Drawing upon theorizing on action control and research on forming and maintaining habits, the PSO emphasizes consistent, sustainable saving activities and incorporating them into one's lifestyle. In a set of nine studies, the PSO scale is developed and its nomological, test-retest, discriminant, and predictive validities are established. The results also show that the PSO moderates the relationship between consumers' financial knowledge and their accumulated savings. Additionally, low-PSO consumers are responsive to an intervention to help them save money. The PSO offers an effective method for understanding differences between consumers in their financial decision making and behaviors, and it can be used as a guide to encourage consistent and sustained saving practices.

TI  - Positioning big data analytics capabilities towards financial service agility
T2  - ASLIB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose Enterprises are increasingly taking actionable steps to transform existing business models through digital technologies for service transformation such as big data analytics (BDA). BDA capabilities offer financial institutions to source financial data, analyse data, insight and store such data and information on collaborative platforms for a quick decision-making process. Accordingly, this study identifies how BDA capabilities can be deployed to provide significant improvement for financial services agility. Design/methodology/approach The study relied on survey data from 485 banking professionals' perspectives with BDA usage, IT capability development and financial service agility. The PLS-SEM technique was used to evaluate the underlying relationship and the applicability of the research framework proposed. Findings Based on the empirical test from this study, distinctive BDA usage grounded on the concept of IT capability viewpoint proof that financial service agility could be enhanced provided enterprises develop technical capabilities alongside other relevant resources. Practical implications The study further highlights the need for financial service managers to identify BDA technologies such as data mining, query and reporting, data visualisation, predictive modelling, streaming analytics, video analytics and voice analytics to focus on financial knowledge gathering and market observation. Financial managers can also deploy BDA tools to develop a strategic road map for data management, data transferability and knowledge discovery for customised financial products. Originality/value This study is a useful contribution to the burgeoning discussion with emerging technologies such as BDA implication to improving enterprises operations.

TI  - Digital financial services usage and subjective financial well-being: evidence from low-income households in Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThe first objective of this study is to analyze whether financial behavior (FB), financial stress (FS), financial literacy (FINLIT) and the locus of control (LOC) influence subjective financial well-being (SFWB) among low-income households in Malaysia. The second objective is to investigate whether the use of digital financial services (DFS) moderates the influence of FB and FS, on SFWB.Design/methodology/approachMotivated by the literature on transformative service research (TRS), this study examines how the use of DFS impact SFWB among low-income households in Malaysia. Low-income households are chosen as they are more likely to be financially excluded and lack financial knowledge and skills. Using an interviewer-administered survey, trained enumerators collected data from 1,948 low-income households in Malaysia, selected using a two-stage sampling based on the National Household Sampling Frame obtained from the Department of Statistics Malaysia.FindingsResults reveal that SFWB is positively influenced by FB and the LOC, and is negatively impacted by FS and FINLIT. The evidence shows that the use of DFS counterintuitively weakened the strength of the relationship between FB and SFWB, but effectively reduced the adverse effect of FS on SFWB.Practical implicationsTo reverse the signs of relationship, financial services marketers need to identify the specific types of DFS that low-income households use in order to provide targeted marketing efforts and financial education to promote the use of DFS on a more holistic basis to increase financial well-being.Originality/valueThe findings of this study add to the body of knowledge deliberating on the opposing effects of technology on consumers' welfare and well-being. This study focuses on the lower-income stratum of Malaysian households as this group of the population is more likely to be financially excluded and have deficiencies in financial knowledge and skills. Findings of this study show that DFS use can actually diminish the positive impact of FB on SFWB while reducing the adverse effect of FS on SFWB.

TI  - Why walk away from an easy gain in wealth? Evidence from a UK stock option plan
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB  - The paper examines the extent and potential reasons for non-exercise of 'in the money' stock options, drawing on employee-level data from the UK Save-As-You-Earn stock option plan. 14 per cent of participants choose not to exercise, and failure to exercise in these circumstances can be costly in terms of foregone increases in wealth. Lesser experience of the option plan, perceived lack of financial knowledge, and greater reliance on friends for advice is associated with failure to exercise. These findings offer challenges to the use of sophisticated reward and benefit schemes by companies when potential participants lack financial capabilities, and add to the literature by showing that financial literacy can remain problematic even when employees have surmounted initial obstacles to joining plans.

TI  - Young Adults' Life Outcomes and Well-Being: Perceived Financial Socialization from Parents, the Romantic Partner, and Young Adults' Own Financial Behaviors
T2  - JOURNAL OF FAMILY AND ECONOMIC ISSUES
AB  - We examined how perceived financial socialization-from parents, the romantic partner, and young adults' own behavior-was associated with young adults' life outcomes and well-being (i.e., physical and mental health, finances, romantic relationship). Using data (N = 504) from young adults specific to their finances, results from hierarchical regression analyses showed that young adults' own financial behaviors were the most patterned, followed by financial socialization from the romantic partner, and then from financial socialization from parents (only objective financial knowledge). We discuss how young adults' financial behavior, financial socialization from the romantic partner and, to a lesser extent, parental socialization are associated with young adults' life domains, underscoring the developmental salience of increased financial capability and relationship formation and decreased dependence on parents during the transition to adulthood.

TI  - Financial education via television comedy
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB  - We show that television may be able to deliver rudimentary financial literacy in a cost-effective manner. In a controlled experiment, Cambodian garment factory workers were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: no video (baseline), slideshow and comedy TV show. After the intervention, to examine whether individuals were able to internalize the information that was provided, participants were asked to answer a set of questions on financial knowledge and attitudes. Our results show that participants randomly assigned to the comedy show are significantly more likely to report that they are interested in obtaining more information on savings accounts and are also significantly more likely to open a savings account in the next 6 months. This method of delivery may prove effective particularly for the disadvantaged sections of the population in remote regions of Cambodia.

TI  - Life lessons: Leaving home and financial capability of young adults
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS
AB  - Young adults today have access to an increasing range of financial products. However, evidence shows young adults generally have low financial capability, leading to poor financial choices with potentially severe and long-lasting consequences. Financial experience represents one proven channel by which people develop the knowledge and ability to make better financial decisions. A potentially pivotal life experience for young adults is moving out of home, which involves a wide range of financial experiences. We examine how leaving home impacts the financial capability of New Zealanders aged 18-25. Our results suggest leaving home is associated with a significant improvement in financial capability but not an increase in financial knowledge. Providing targeted guidance to home leavers may offer an effective opportunity to improve the financial capability of young adults and minimize costly mistakes.

TI  - Childhood Financial Socialization and Debt-Related Financial Well-Being Indicators in Adulthood
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND PLANNING
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the potential influence of childhood financial socialization on financial well-being in adulthood. Using a sample (N = 2,213) from De Nederlandsche Bank Household Survey (DHS) we modeled the likelihood of household debt/asset ratio less than or equal to 40%, and the likelihood of a household reporting a current ratio (liquid asset /short-term debt ratio) greater than or equal to 100%. Consistent with predictions of social learning theory, being encouraged to save during childhood had a positive association with meeting the financial planning industry benchmarks for these financial ratios in adulthood. The key implication is that the path to financial well-being does not begin with financial knowledge attained in adulthood, but instead begins with experiential learning and socialization during childhood.

TI  - Does economics and management education make managers more cautious? Evidence from R&D of Chinese listed firms
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - This paper uses the innovation data of Chinese listed firms for 2015-2019 to investigate whether and how executives with economics and management educations influence firm innovation. We find that executives with economics and management educations are characterized by conser-vatism and risk avoidance and their firms undertake less innovative activity than other firms. This conclusion remains robust after excluding potential reverse causality. Further analysis finds that executives with an educational background in economics and management adopt a more con-servative attitude toward risk when they have a low shareholding ratio or face high performance pressure. Moreover, a mechanism analysis shows that executives with an educational background economics and management are more radical and less conservative in their fields of expertise, i.e., are not blindly conservative. Finally, we determine that non-financial knowledge compensate for some of the inhibitory effects that economic and management educational backgrounds have on innovation.

TI  - The Influence of Government Dimension on Financial Education and Empowerment of Micro-, Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises in Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - The study examines the influence of the five pillars of inclusive financing on the empowerment of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and the influence of institutional conditions on the empowerment of MSMEs. This study uses primary and secondary data. The population of the study are MSMEs; the is a total of 930,620 MSMEs in Jakarta. Owners of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises is a good population to be measured because they are the main actors that know exactly the challenges and the obstacles in doing business addressing problems faced in inclusive financing, which is related to the purpose of the study. The research borrows from finance and entrepreneurial theories for model design. The results of the study show that all the variables are significant and positive in the efforts to finance MSMEs in Indonesia, which means that financial education plays an important role in the sustainability of financial inclusion. The financial theory, developed to explain financing at the company level, needs to be adapted to the entrepreneurial situation, so that it can explain the behavior of small businesses. This means that, with correct financial knowledge, financial inclusion plays an important role in the sustainability of MSMEs in Indonesia.

TI  - Financial modeling and improvement planning for the life insurance industry by using a rough knowledge based hybrid MCDM model
T2  - INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB  - Financial modeling for the life insurance industry involves two main difficulties: (1) Selecting the minimal and critical variables for modeling while considering the impreciseness and interrelationships among the numerous attributes and (2) measuring plausible synergy effects among variables and dimensions that might cause undesirable biases for an evaluation model. To overcome these difficulties, this paper proposes a two-stage hybrid approach: Rough financial knowledge is retrieved first, and then the obtained core attributes are measured and synthesized using fuzzy-integral-based decision methods. The main innovation of this study is the use of rough knowledge retrieval procedures and fuzzy measures for exploring the synergy effects on financial performance. This approach is expected to support insurers to systematically improve their financial performance. A group of life insurance companies in Taiwan was analyzed, and the findings support the existence of interrelated synergy effects among the core criteria. In addition, five companies were examined to illustrate financial performance improvement planning with this approach. This study bridges the gap between advanced soft computing techniques and pragmatic financial modeling in a dynamic business environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Crypto cravings: Gender differences in crypto investment intentions and the mediating roles of financial overconfidence and personality
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING
AB  - Cryptocurrencies have ballooned into a billion-dollar business. To inform regulations aimed at protecting consumers vulnerable to suboptimal financial decisions, we investigate crypto investment intentions as a function of consumer gender, financial overconfidence (greater subjective relative to objective financial knowledge), and the Big Five personality traits. Study 1 (N = 126) found that people believe each Big Five personality trait as well as consumer gender and financial overconfidence to predict consumers' crypto investment intentions. Study 2 (N = 1741) revealed that less than 1 in 10 consumers from a nationally representative sample (Norway) are willing to invest in crypto. However, the proportion of male (vs. female) consumers considering such investments is more than twice as large, with less (vs. more) agreeable and less (vs. more) conscientious, but more (vs. less) open and more (vs. less) financially overconfident consumers also being increasingly inclined to consider crypto investments. Financial overconfidence, agreeableness, and conscientiousness mediate the link between consumer gender and crypto investment intentions. These results hold after accounting for a theoretically relevant confounding factor (financial self-efficacy). Together, this research offers novel implications for marketing theory and practice that help understand the observed gender differences in consumers' crypto investments.

TI  - Who Is Successful in Foreign Exchange Margin Trading? New Survey Evidence from Japan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - We use a 2018 survey of FX margin traders in Japan to investigate which key factors influence their trading performance: socio-demographic and economic situation, investment strategy and trading behaviour, and/or financial literacy. We study this question using general-to-specific modelling and impulse-indicator saturation. First, the data show that variables from all three groups are significant predictors of traders' performance. Second, we find that older traders and those without a specific trading strategy demonstrate lower performance. Performance is higher for those who trade greater amounts, rely more on fundamental analysis, and report having profitable FX trade skills. Third, respondents' subjectively stated claim of having FX trade skills is based on a more advanced understanding of FX trading and a reliance on professional advice. Neither objective financial knowledge nor over/underconfidence play a noteworthy role in the performance of margin traders.

TI  - An Assessment Tool to Identify the Financial Literacy Level of Financial Education Programs Participants' Executed by Ecuadorian Financial Institutions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Due to the lack of a tool assessing the effectiveness of Financial Education Programs (FEP) imparted by the financial institutions (FI) in Ecuador by mandate, this research proposes and validates a scale to evaluate the Financial Literacy (FL) level of 314 participants (15-50 years old) after attending an FEP. The final 18-item FL scale, compounded with Financial Attitude, Financial Knowledge, and Financial Behavior dimensions, is reliable and robust according to the Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The average score for FL is 76 out of 100 points. The youngest scored the lowest, and the FI employees the highest. This contribution fulfills a needed FL scale to accurately measure the efforts of FI spreading the FE. It serves as a stepping stone for further research reconfirming its validity and applying the proposed FI's FL scale as a pre-post FL evaluation.

TI  - Financial and Non-Financial Barriers to Innovation and the Degree of Radicalness
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The aim of this study is to analyse the effects of barriers to innovation on firms' propensity to engage in radical and incremental innovations. We look at innovative and potentially innovative firms and estimate the effect of three types of barriers-financial, knowledge and competition-on the propensity to radical innovation new to the world, radical innovation new to the market and incremental innovation. An empirical study has been performed, drawing on data collected from the German Mannheim Innovation Panel covering the period from 2014 to 2016. Empirical results reveal heterogeneous effects of barriers depending on the degree of radicalness. In particular, knowledge and competition barriers are an impediment to radical innovation, whereas financial and knowledge barriers reduce a probability of incremental innovation. Based on the findings, we discuss policy recommendations for mitigating barriers to innovation conditional on the degree of radicalness.

TI  - Financial advisor's covert discrimination against long-term clients
T2  - PACIFIC-BASIN FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - While trust relationships are crucial for financial advisory industry, financial advisors may engage in activities that can destroy those relationships. This paper investigates whether financial advisors tend to exploit existing clients in favor of new clients. We use the offering of high-returnzero-risk products as an inverse measure for advisors' service quality in the context of Chinese trust products featuring implicit guarantees. We find that as the advisor-client tenure increases, advisors tend to recommend less high-return-zero-risk products. As a result, existing clients' investment portfolios' returns decline over time. We also find that financial advisors intensify discrimination against existing clients when the supply of high-return-zero-risk products is low. Such discrimination is particularly pronounced when clients are not wealthy or lack financial knowledge, and advisors tend to offer higher-commission products to existing clients.

TI  - Financial literacy in Tunisia: Its determinants and its implications on investment behavior
T2  - RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB  - Given the dynamic changes in the economic environment, especially in financial markets, a need is felt to improve investors' financial knowledge. Financial literacy entails informed financial decisions. The present study investigates the determinants of financial literacy and its impact on investment behavior. A questionnaire has been developed to elicit the study's variables and it is divided into three parts. The first part covers the demographic variables; the second deals with the financial behavior of the Tunisian households, and the third part is devoted to financial literacy.
   The study's findings are two fold: First, individuals with a low level of financial literacy are less likely to invest in the stock market. Second, the financial literacy level is found to be affected by age, education level, and the annual income. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Financial literacy, access to finance, SMEs performance and Islamic religiosity: evidence from Saudi Arabia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP & SMALL BUSINESS
AB  - This paper seeks to explore the impact of access to finance and financial literacy on the SMEs performance in an Islamic context. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design by employing 255 SMEs in Saudi Arabia. The findings showed a positive mediating effect of access to finance on the relationship between financial awareness, financial attitude and SMEs performance while access to finance does not mediate the nexus between financial knowledge and SMEs performance. Subsequently, the findings revealed that access to finance have positive effect on SMEs performance. This study also found that access to finance increases the positive relationship between financial literacy and SMEs performance. The role of religiosity was found to positively increase access to finance towards affecting SMEs performance. The findings of this study provide SMEs with the knowledge to increase their religious practices to access government Islamic funds, i.e., Mudarabah and Musharakah while Islamic banking firms should increase their Islamic products and services to attract SMEs in Saudi Arabia.

TI  - The role of financial behaviour, financial literacy, and financial stress in explaining the financial well-being of B40 group in Malaysia
T2  - FUTURE BUSINESS JOURNAL
AB  - Understanding the financial well-being of lower-income group is a critical concern of any government as this group struggles most to meet up with their necessities. Despite the significance, little is known about financial well-being of low-income group. This study attempts to investigate the relationship between financial literacy, financial behaviour, financial stress, and financial well-being of B40 group in Malaysia. A total of 412 usable responses was derived from a survey in Klang Valley and analysed the data following partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) techniques. The results demonstrate that financial behaviour is the key antecedent followed by financial stress and financial literacy in predicting financial well-being. Hence, balancing between income and expenditure, managing financial stress, and increasing financial literacy would be necessary to assure financial well-being of lower-income group people. Governmental and institutional interventions are essential to equip the low-income group people with employment opportunities and financial knowledge to manage their basic living standards.

TI  - Individual entrepreneurial behavior and financial literacy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - The technological revolution we have been witnessing over the last 30 years is bringing about important changes in business management, specifically in the conception, development, and management of its financial aspects. How to face these challenges is a particularly critical question for individual entrepreneurs who have to assume a much greater responsibility for decisions than in other corporate environments. In this sense, it is very important to understand the financial capabilities and skills and their limitations of this type of entrepreneurship, which is so important for the renewal and extension of the business community in any developed economy. Based on an extensive official survey of this type of entrepreneurship, this research proposes a logistic regression modeling, in order to find out the level of financial knowledge of this business group. One of the findings of this research is that individual entrepreneurs have a higher level of financial knowledge than salaried workers, with a higher qualification in this respect in the case of individual entrepreneurs with employees. This study analyses the link between individual entrepreneurs or self-employed workers - with or without employees - and financial literacy. In addition, we investigated the relationship between this group with their socio-demographic characteristics, financial product holdings, financial planning, and financial fragility. Different binary logistic regression models with maximum likelihood were estimated using a sample of individual entrepreneurs and self-employed workers from the Survey of Financial Competences database conducted in Spain to achieve this. The results of the study show that individuals who choose to be individual entrepreneurs or self-employed, and in particular those with hired workers, had a higher level of financial literacy than salaried workers. Moreover, it was confirmed that financial literacy complements the explanatory power of the other variables analyzed with respect to sole proprietors without employees, although not to a significant degree. The limitations of this work are due to the use of data from the Financial Skills Survey, so some dichotomous variables offer very generic information. In addition, the database is cross-sectional and we cannot analyze variations between different periods. No research before had applied the relationships between the behavior of individual entrepreneurs, with and without employees, and financial competencies using logistic functions and on the basis of a rigorous and comprehensive formal questionnaire. The conclusions provide a valuable perspective for developing training programs for this type of human capital aimed at raising the financial skills of individual entrepreneurs to improve personal and business management.

TI  - Comparison of financial education and knowledge in the United States and Germany: Curriculum and assessment
T2  - RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB  - Changes in the economy and society lead to a growing necessity of financial education. In this context, we investigate the approaches to financial education in secondary schools in the United States and Germany. We seek to answer the question if and how the implementation of financial education is similar and different between the two countries. We address this question for financial education by comparing the educational conditions, coursework structures, content standards, instructional resources, and assessment within each country. Additionally, we focus on differences in cognitive structure of financial knowledge and understanding among students within each country. For this exploratory analysis, we used data from the Test of Financial Literacy that was administered to students in the United States and Germany (n = 2326). The empirical results reveal differences in knowledge structures in specific content areas among students in the two countries. Possible reasons for such differences and other implications are discussed.

TI  - Dual Credit Markets and Household Usage to Finance: Evidence from a Representative Chinese Household Survey
T2  - OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS
AB  - Using a new and representative data set of Chinese household finance, we document household usage and costs of finance, along with their correlates. As in many developing countries, informal credit is a crucial element of household finance, and interest-free informal loans based on reciprocal personal relationships are highly prevalent in our sample. Not surprisingly, wealth tends to be associated with greater usage of both formal and informal finance. Political connections, extensive social networks and certain household demographic characteristics (such as size) are all positively associated with formal or informal credit usage (or both). Overall, our findings show signs that a dual credit market is emerging in China, with the poor, politically unconnected, and those with larger family sizes still heavily reliant on informal finance, most of which are interest-free, while younger, wealthier households with better political connections and financial knowledge are increasingly using formal finance.

TI  - Smart tools? A randomized controlled trial on the impact of three different media tools on personal finance
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
AB  - By using a randomized controlled trial we test the impact of three treatments on financial literacy (knowledge, attitudes, reported behavior) among adolescents in Austria. Treatments comprise a documentary movie on debt, an internet exercise and a budgeting smartphone app. It is investigated if particularly the latter two instruments could serve as standalone alternatives (nudges) to conventional teaching interventions. Users of the budgeting app report to check their current account balance significantly more often than the control group. The web exercise, however, neither raises interest in personal finance issues nor significantly increases basic financial knowledge. The documentary movie did not affect attitudes towards saving or private credits. Even if it is only about raising awareness and interest in financial matters among adolescents, the ICT applications tested in this study thus do not lend strong support to policies solely relying on digital "stand-alone" solutions of similar design.

TI  - Do Employee Share Owners Face Too Much Financial Risk?
T2  - ILR REVIEW
AB  - A major theoretical objection against employee share ownership is that workers are exposed to excessive financial risk. Theory posits that 10 to 15% of a typical worker's wealth portfolio can be prudently invested in employer stock. The authors analyze employee share ownership in US family portfolios using the 2004 to 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances. Overall, 15.3% of families with private-sector employees held employer stock in 2016, and one in six of these families exceeded the 15% threshold. Employee share ownership appears to generally add to, rather than substitute for, both pension and overall wealth. Employee share owners express higher risk tolerance and financial knowledge and greater understanding of the value of diversification. While financial risk does not appear to be a substantial problem for most employee share owners, a small minority may face excessive risk, and the authors suggest approaches to reduce such risk.

TI  - Numeracy and wealth
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Numeracy is defined as the ability to understand and use numerical information. We examined the relationship between numeracy and wealth using a cross-sectional and a longitudinal study. For a sample of approximately 1000 Dutch adults, we found a statistically significant correlation between numeracy and wealth, even after controlling for differences in education, risk preferences, beliefs about future income, financial knowledge, need for cognition or seeking financial advice. Conditional on socio-demographic characteristics, our estimates suggest that on average a one-point increase in the numeracy score (11-point scale) of the respondent is associated with 5 percent more personal wealth. Additionally, we find that numeracy is a key determinant of the wealth accumulation trajectories that people follow over time. Over a 5-year period, while participants with low numeracy decumulate wealth, participants with high numeracy maintain a constant positive level of wealth. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - THE FUTURE OF CORPORATE REPORTING: INTEGRATED REPORTING
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ECONOMICS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Throughout the history, many different reporting practices have been emerged in accordance with the needs of business environment such as financial, corporate social responsibility and sustainability reporting. Today, stakeholders want to be informed more in a simplest way, but many stand-alone and genuinely long reports have been still prepared by companies to demonstrate their financial and non-financial outcomes. However, it is inadequate to assess the reports separately to understand and make a decision on the actual performance of companies. Additionally, creating value side of the current reports are still being debated. Therefore, corporate reporting must move a step forward to express more with less, which called as "Integrated Reporting" (IR) that combines the all pieces of puzzle. It isn't only integrating both financial and non-financial knowledge into a single and brief report, but also integrated thinking of all aspects of businesses in terms of creating value over time. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to emphasize advancements in corporate reporting towards the IR. Also, it aims to explain its meaning, main aspects, and effects on the business environment. Today, companies should comply with IR, and this study is essential to contribute to the literature, subsequent studies, and companies.

TI  - CAN FINTECH CURB INCOME INEQUALITY IN CHINA?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The effect of FinTech on income inequality in China and the characteristics of the existing thresholds are examined in this study based on China provincial panel data from 2011 to 2020 by combining dynamic panel differential GMM with panel threshold models. As revealed by this study, (1) FinTech can significantly curb income inequality. (2) FinTech can mitigate income inequality in all regions, and the degree of mitigation is more significant in the central and western regions of China. (3) The improvement of FinTech development can reduce income inequality in all quantiles. The regions with high-income inequality and low-income inequality are compared. The comparison results reveal that FinTech can reduce income inequality to a greater extent in regions with lowincome inequality. (4) FinTech can restrain income inequality under different threshold variables, and the restraining effect of economic growth is the most significant. The policy significance of this study is to fully exploit the empowerment and income-generating role played by FinTech, build a more inclusive financial system, create a good financial environment, cultivate residents' financial knowledge level, enhance the ability of low-income groups to obtain income from financial services and reduce income inequality, to fulfill the development goal of common prosperity.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT OF SME
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMY
AB  - Numerous research studies deal with the issue of researching the impacts on credit risk determinants in the SME segment. The study of economic factors that are easier to quantify from methodological point of view, and which prevent complex evaluation of causality of interest rate risk and the discovery of various social barriers dominate. This consistent fact forms a platform in designing the research to introduce a model of dependency of effective credit risk management in the SME segment on significant social and economic factors. Empirical research was carried out in the Czech business environment in 2017 on a sample of 352 enterprises. The structural analysis modeling (SEM) was the main analytical method. The research results confirmed the fact that an effective approach to managing the SME's credit risk is determined by a number of factors of a non-economic nature. The most important are education and family environment. These are followed by economic factors, such as a relationship with banks, financial knowledge in the area of capital and payment discipline. The multi-spectral dimension of the findings and causality also opened up a wide discussion and prepared a high-quality data research base for further deeper exploration of this issue.

TI  - Breaking the Bonds of Segregation: Civil Rights Politics and the History of Modern Finance
T2  - AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW
AB  - This article uncovers the financial knowledge and bond market campaigns of the paradigmatic non-violent revolution of the twentieth century-the civil rights movement. It builds on an interpretation made by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) during the early 1960s: segregation was a national problem because it was financed through a network of bankers across the country who specialized in the business of debt; certified by prominent bond attorneys in New York City, Chicago, and elsewhere; and because investors from around the country collected tax-exempt interest payments from indebted southern segregated municipalities. By weaving the internal memos, protest ephemera, and legal strategies of civil rights activists together with the credit assessments, scheduled bond offerings, and perspectives of financiers, this article reconstructs the attempts to politicize bond market transactions and efforts to place the economic certainty of segregation in doubt. In so doing, it offers a fresh perspective on the so-called classic phase of the civil rights movement (1954-1965). More generally, it raises powerful questions about the dilemmas of investment-focused campaigns, and how finance capital compounds the difficulties of organizing against authoritarian regimes.

TI  - FinBERT-MRC: Financial Named Entity Recognition Using BERT Under the Machine Reading Comprehension Paradigm
T2  - NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS
AB  - Financial named entity recognition (FinNER) is a challenging task in the field of financial text information extraction, which aims to extract a large amount of financial knowledge from unstructured texts. It is widely accepted to use the sequence tagging framework to implement the FinNER tasks. However, such sequence tagging models cannot fully take advantage of the semantic information in the texts. Instead, we formulate the FinNER task as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem and propose a new model termed FinBERT-MRC. This formulation introduces significant prior information by utilizing well-designed queries, and extracts the start index and end index of the target entities without decoding modules such as conditional random fields (CRFs). We conduct experiments on a publicly available Chinese financial dataset ChFinAnn and a real-world business dataset AdminPunish. FinBERT-MRC achieves average F-1 scores of 92.78% and 96.80% on two datasets, respectively, with average F(1 )gains + 3.75% and + 0.68% over some sequence tagging models including BiLSTM-CRF, BiGRU-CRF, BiLSTM-CNN-CRF, FinBERT-Tagger, and FinBERT-CRF. The source code is available at https://github.com/zyz0000/FinBERT-MRC.

TI  - Value as capital-in-use: Unpacking the temporal impacts and managerial implications for organisational value
T2  - INDUSTRIAL MARKETING MANAGEMENT
AB  - Value is a widely researched and much debated topic, but one still characterised by conceptual deficiencies. While multiple competing value perspectives exists in the current literature, they provide limited insights in terms of temporal impacts and implications for organisational value creation. To address this gap, this conceptual article develops the notion of value as capital-in-use, which complements extant value literature by providing a capital-oriented perspective and conceptualisation of the nature, characteristics, and dimensions of value. We develop the concept by reviewing four categories of capital (physical, financial, knowledge, and social), and unpacking their dimensions in terms of locus, latency, temporality and convertibility, to distinguish the implications they each hold as potential sources of organisational value. Variations in the properties of the four categories of capital have management implications that are typically poorly recognised, especially in terms of costs and risk associated with latent or perishable capital. This paper contributes to current value theory by establishing its relationship to capital, and extending coverage of the temporal dimension of value.

TI  - Two birds with one stone: can public financial support help firms to address financial and non-financial obstacles to research and innovation?
T2  - INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION
AB  - Financial, knowledge and market obstacles can restrict firm-level research and innovation (R&I). Public financial support for R&I can clearly help firms that face financial obstacles to invest in R&I. Building on the literature concerning the learning effects of public financial support for R&I, and using a novel combination of administrative and innovation-survey data, we demonstrate for the first time, that such public financial support also results in more R&I in firms that face knowledge and market obstacles. Despite this, however, public financial support for R&I does not reduce the importance that firms attach to their financial and knowledge obstacles. Moreover, it increases the importance that firms attach to their market obstacles. This suggests that while effective at helping firms to increase their R&I activities, addressing firms' financial and non-financial obstacles may require additional policy interventions, alongside public financial support for R&I. Our study offers novel insights for theory and policy.

TI  - Exploring Financial Well-being's Impact on Retirement Planning: The Mediating Role of Financial Attitude
T2  - FIIB BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - This study seeks to examine the impact of financial attitude, financial well-being and selected socio-economic factors on retirement planning. Employing a survey-based approach, primary data was gathered from 506 respondents using structured questionnaires through convenience sampling. The research hypotheses were examined using the application of structural equation modelling, with a special emphasis on assessing the mediating influence of financial attitude on the association between financial well-being and retirement planning. This study also examines the potential moderating influences of factors, including age, gender, education and income, on the association between financial attitude, financial well-being and retirement planning. The findings illustrate a significant correlation between an individual's financial perspective, financial welfare and inclination to participate in retirement preparation. Moreover, it was discovered that certain variables exerted significant moderating effects on these relationships. The research acknowledges certain limitations, such as the omission of variables like financial knowledge and external influences such as parental and societal factors. These research implications can guide policymakers and institutions in the creation of effective financial literacy programs and investor awareness seminars.

TI  - People are people: A comparative analysis of risk attitudes across Europe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS
AB  - In this paper, we conduct a detailed examination of the determinants of attitudes to financial risk among retail investors in six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). We find that respondents from the United Kingdom and Belgium are the most risk tolerant while those from Spain are the least. We observe remarkable similarities in the distributions of risk tolerance across countries despite cultural differences and considerable variations in the extent to which risky investing is undertaken as a routine part of financial planning. We further show that country effects in the cross-sectional variation of attitude to risk scores are swamped by the impacts of gender, salary and wealth, while financial knowledge and prior investment experience are much more important still. Our results have implications for regulators and those who wish to encourage European investors to consider going beyond bank savings and guaranteed products to more prevalent stock market investing in an era of negative real interest rates.

TI  - Financial literacy and financial resilience: Evidence from around the world
T2  - FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - We measure financial literacy using questions assessing basic knowledge of four fundamental concepts in financial decision making: knowledge of interest rates, interest compounding, inflation, and risk diversification. Worldwide, just one in three adults are financially literate-that is, they know at least three out of the four financial concepts. Women, poor adults, and lower educated respondents are more likely to suffer from gaps in financial knowledge. This is true not only in developing countries but also in countries with well-developed financial markets. Relatively low financial literacy levels exacerbate consumer and financial market risks as increasingly complex financial instruments enter the market. Credit products, many of which carry high interest rates and complex terms and conditions, are becoming more readily available. Yet only around half of adults in major emerging countries who use a credit card or borrow from a financial institution are financially literate. We discuss policies to protect borrowers against risks and encourage account holders to save.

AB  - During the global pandemic, the frequency of digital financial services has increased, one of the reasons for which may be the fear of infection, which is not necessarily based on prudent orientation. Nowadays, to navigate in the increasingly digital financial market, it is essential to have the right tools and competencies that help in the use of services. During the population survey conducted in the summer of 2019 - before the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic -, I examined the level of digital competencies in managing finances and its correlations with the level of financial knowledge and the use of electronic financial services. I researched possible gender differences regarding digital competencies, and whether the use of digital tools is dependent of demographic characteristics. I found out that the competencies of women and men led to similar results. However, the development level of one's place of residence is related to the frequency of use of electronic devices.

TI  - Value creation in art galleries: A service logic analysis
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN MARKETING JOURNAL
AB  - This study addresses how non-profit organisations like art galleries participate in co-creating value to visitors (customers), providers, and other stakeholders, and how these processes can be conceptualised within a service logic framework. We evaluate how an art gallery touring exhibition in regional Australia contributed to customer value, drawing on data collected in 2014-2016 from publications and websites, and interviews with staffof art galleries and arts organisations. Our findings illuminated four forms of value creation: financial, knowledge sharing, social and cultural, and professional value. Country art galleries have strong visitor orientation and employ co-creation processes focused on enhancing visitors' experience, aligned with government directions on Indigenous understanding and objectives of local Indigenous art communities. However, customer value exchange is not well understood. The lack of marketing research expertise and usable visitor data is a barrier to value creation.

TI  - The moderating effects of financial broad-scope trust on consumer knowledge, cognitive effort, and financial healthiness
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR
AB  - Substantial research results suggest the global financial crisis has negatively affected consumers' trust in financial service providers. Notably, trust not only relates to consumer trust in individual companies but also relates to the broader business context in which consumers may plan and carry out their financial behavior. This latter form of trust can be referred to as "broad-scope" trust (BST). BST is especially important in a society context because lack of BST may reduce financial market dynamism, competition, and productivity. Consequently, financial service providers assume an important social responsibility in order to develop BST. Unfortunately, not much is known about the interplay between BST and consumer financial behavior. Based on two surveys comprising 1155 bank consumers and 756 mutual fund investors, respectively, this study investigates the moderating influence of BST on relations between knowledge, cognitive effort, and financial healthiness and also examines the direct influence of BST on cognitive effort and financial healthiness. The results indicate that BST negatively moderates relations between knowledge and financial healthiness and between cognitive effort and financial healthiness. In addition, it is demonstrated that BST negatively influences cognitive effort and positively influences financial healthiness. Our results demonstrate the importance of developing BST as it may ease the burdens put on consumers' financial knowledge and processing capabilities, which in turn may facilitate their financial well-being.

AB  - Education is deliberated comprehensively as a gadget for growing financial economy. It also offers suggestions gearing the new generations to contract with the contests of markets in the future. Deprived of a vigorous education curriculum, neither economic nor social development is conceivable in Pakistan. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the role of curriculum of higher education for fostering the economic development and find out relationship between curriculum and economic development. The subjects of this research were university students and sample of 600 university students were selected via stratified and simple random procedure. The collected data was analyzed by using descriptive statistics frequency percentage and correlation on SPSS version 28.0. The results exposed the low indications that the Pakistani curriculum is teaching the techniques of financial learning, financial intelligence to its youth. The results found that participants were incapable to capitalize and grasp businesses in the global market to revel in financial independence. Positive descriptions for educational institutes entails to update their curriculum with acquaint practical courses for youth with boosted job scenarios in the marketplace. A robust positive correlation between financial knowledge and job opportunities as an apprise in the curriculum with modern-day mandatory subjects can resulted to enhance opportunities for graduates in the job market.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose In Indonesia, the Islamic Economics and Finance Sector is growing rapidly, but the literature on Islamic financial literacy is still minimal. This study aims to show research opportunities with the theme of Islamic financial literacy, especially inclusive Islamic financial planning through bibliometric analysis of Scopus and connected papers. Design/methodology/approach A comma separated value (CSV) file containing more than 2,000 references meta data was used for analysis on Vos Viewer in the period of 1963-2020. The grouping of network visualization maps is done using six keywords, namely, "Financial Literacy," "Financial Inclusion," "Islamic Financial Literacy," "Financial Planning," "Personal Finance" and "Household Finance." Findings The findings complement the keywords that are generally used as references in the formation of theories regarding inclusive Islamic financial planning. After combining the "ris" file from the connected paper, the most used terms are financial knowledge, financial education, financial behavior, financial decision-making process, financial inclusion, risk sharing and financial discourse. Originality/value The proportion which planned to be applied in Indonesia will differentiate the inclusive Islamic financial planning framework from what has been done before. This study outlines the basis of the relevant literature review in the theme of Islamic financial literacy research, especially inclusive Islamic financial planning.

TI  - How materialism shapes the effectiveness of financial literacy messages: A cross-cultural perspective
T2  - APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW-PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE
AB  - This cross-cultural experiment (N = 1000) shows that messages designed to promote financial literacy are differently effective among US and Arab consumers depending on the salience of materialistic thoughts at the time of exposure. Among US consumers, financial literacy messages increased savings intention by heightening the importance of saving when materialistic thoughts were salient but had no impact otherwise. This is consistent with existing research that has largely focused on WEIRD countries (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, Democratic; Henrich et al., 2010). However, among Arab consumers (data collected in the United Arab Emirates), we found that financial optimism was a key construct to explain savings behaviors. Specifically, our results show that financial literacy messages lower levels of financial optimism and, thus, increase savings intention at baseline levels. When materialistic thoughts are salient, our results suggest that Arab consumers prefer spending in the presence of financial literacy messages because having materialistic thoughts heightens financial optimism when one is assured that acquiring financial knowledge and skills guarantees one's financial success.

TI  - Hubris or talent? Estimating the role of overconfidence in Chinese households' investment decisions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB  - We document the extent to which overconfidence in one's financial literacy (FL overconfidence) plays a role in households' reported financial risk aversion and their actual investment behavior, using data from the China Household Finance Survey. We measure FL overconfidence by estimating the gap between people's self-reported financial literacy and their objectively measured financial knowledge. Our results indicate that FL overconfidence is negatively associated with self-reported financial risk aversion. Additionally, FL overconfidence is positively associated with the likelihood of having a brokerage account, holding risky financial instruments (other than just stock), and a proportion of assets allocated towards risky assets. We then use machine learning methods to predict which factors are most important in determining households' risky investment decisions. We find that overconfidence plays a significant predictive role. Our work signals that households' risky investments may be driven by biased optimism about their own financial know-how rather than their actual knowledge. We conclude that financial literacy programs should not only teach financial concepts but also make program participants aware of their own biases.

TI  - Digital vs. in-person financial education: What works best for Generation Z?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Nowadays, financial literacy is one of the most important skills that can be acquired by a tech-savvy Generation Z student. In order to understand what format of financial education works best for Generation Z, we set up an experiment that involved implementing a financial education program called "Futuro Sicuro" with a sample of 650 High School students in Italy. The program allowed us to gather data from two treatments at the class level, namely 1) a traditional financial education simplified program with the presence of a financial advisor, and 2) a digital financial education program using web-based applications based on learning-by-playing concepts. The two treatments were associated with different costs but showed similar effects: three weeks after their conclusion, we find that both courses did increase actual financial knowledge and the results also aligned with participants' realistic assessments of their own financial skills. A follow-up study also reveals the persistence of these effects three months later for the traditional course. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Evolution of University Students' Financial Attitudes and Their Role in the Sustainability of Personal Finances
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the question of how crises influence the decision-making of Hungarian university students. Crises increase the risk of sustainability, so it is crucial to make appropriate financial decisions in such a situation. For this purpose, the authors conducted a two-stage questionnaire survey among students of economics and other majors. The inquiries took place in 2019 (n = 1558) and 2020 (n = 1712). A regression study was used to analyse the evolution of financial attitudes and investment knowledge, as well as how they are affected by a potential crisis modelled with the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been shown that interest in financial matters increases as a result of the crisis and the level of financial knowledge also increases. However, the most important conclusion of the study is that, in the event of a high threat, knowledge and practice can only be combined with calm thinking to help make appropriate financial decisions. All of this together ensures that investment decisions are the basis for the sustainability of personal finances.

TI  - Who is more important, parents or children? Economic and environmental factors and health insurance purchase
T2  - NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB  - The existing research indicates that insurance demand is affected by the policyholder's occupation, family economy, urbanization level, and insurance coverage. Using micro data of insurance purchase at the individual level, this study investigates the influence of economic and environmental factors on the priorities of health insurance purchase decision. The results reveal that the more developed the economy and the more financial knowledge people possess, the more the latter tend to prioritize health insurance for their children. Furthermore, the study investigates the influence of air pollution on the decision to purchase health insurance. If the air pollution level is high, policyholders prioritize obtaining insurance for their children. Our research on the order of insurance purchase indicates that Chinese families have a lack of support from their children, and the function of family pension is gradually weakening. Our research also reveals that families are willing to spend money on the insurance of their children. Therefore, to solve the problem of health and old-age security for the elderly, it is more effective to promote health insurance by considering families as a unit

TI  - THE NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS FOR RETIREMENT FUNDING ADEQUACY: A FUZZY SET ANALYSIS
T2  - ECONOMICS & SOCIOLOGY
AB  - Although retirement funding adequacy literature has explored perceptions of retirement preparations and savings targets, there remains a lack of understanding of which conditions are necessary and sufficient for it to occur. This study identifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for retirement funding adequacy by examining the extent to which demographic, psychological and behavioural variables predict its occurrence. Within the context of South Africa, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis was used to test a complex model and qualify the processes that lead to retirement funding adequacy. The results show that educated women of higher socio-economic status are associated with retirement provisions. Thus, the inclusion and empowerment of women in financial planning activities results in positive retirement outcomes. Furthermore, retirement provisions precede retirement funding adequacy, and financial knowledge is a necessary condition for both retirement provisions and retirement funding adequacy. This research is relevant for financial planners and institutions encouraging individuals to plan and save for retirement in order to reduce the retirement funding adequacy gap experienced by retirees.

TI  - Entrepreneurship as a Neglected Pitfall in Future Finnish Teachers' Readiness to Teach 21st Century Competencies and Financial Literacy: Expectancies, Values, and Capability
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine entrepreneurship in the context of future Finnish teachers' readiness to teach 21st century (broad-based) competencies. Teachers' self-efficacy in teaching entrepreneurial skills and financial matters is vital for their pupils to actively participate and flourish in future society. The study utilized survey data of future teachers' expectancy-values in teaching seven broad-based competencies of the current national curriculum and their financial literacy. Future teachers expressed high interest in all competencies but reported the least self-efficacy and highest cost in teaching ICT as well as working life and entrepreneurship competencies. Teaching self-efficacy (TSE) in entrepreneurial competencies was predicted by subjective evaluations of financial capability and TSE in consumer skills. Teaching STEM subjects as well as male gender were related to better objective financial knowledge. We discuss the implications of observed financial capability, lack in self-efficacy, and high experienced cost of teaching these competencies. Support for future teachers' readiness to teach working life skills, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy through phenomenon-based school subject collaboration, formal teacher training, and digital applications are emphasized.

TI  - Why does subjective financial literacy hinder retirement saving? The mediating roles of risk tolerance and risk perception
T2  - REVIEW OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine a mechanism through which subjective financial literacy can exert negative effects on the retirement saving intention and behaviors, which has not been well understood in prior research. Particularly, the authors draw on the relevant risk literature to introduce financial risk tolerance and risk perception as important mediators that transfer subjective financial literacy into reduced retirement saving intention which in turn affects the saving behaviors. Design/methodology/approach The authors test the model with a sample of 347 adults using factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Findings Consistent with the notions about the negative side of subjective financial literacy, the authors find supporting evidence for the proposed indirect effects of financial literacy on retirement saving intention via risk tolerance and risk perception. In addition, the authors observe that an individual's retirement saving intention strongly predicts their retirement saving behaviors. Originality/value The study offers insights into the mechanisms that subjective financial knowledge might also inhibit individual's responsible financial behaviors (e.g. retirement saving).

TI  - The dilemma of millennial Muslims towards financial management: an Islamic financial literacy perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to empirically investigate the pathway to financial management behavioural intentions (FMBI) from Islamic perspectives, through dimensions of Islamic financial literacy (IFL; Islamic financial knowledge [IFK], financial skills [FS] and self-efficacy [SE]) based on an extension to the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) model. Design/methodology/approachData was collected via a self-administered questionnaire by 300 millennials (Muslims) working in Malaysia. Structural equation modelling was used for data analysis purposes by using SmartPLS. FindingsThe results present the positive and significant influence of IFK on financial attitude (FA), FS on the elements of FA, subjective norm (SN), perceived behavioural control (PBC) and perceived moral obligation (PMO), SE on FA, FS on the elements of FA, SN and PBC. Furthermore, PBC and PMO were strong predictors of FMBI from an Islamic standpoint. Originality/valueThe findings successfully contribute to the theoretical extension of the TPB model via dimensions of IFL (IFK, FS and SE) as predictors of FA, SNs, PBC and PMO. Besides, this study provides some new insights of millennial Muslims concerning IFL and financial management from Islamic beliefs.

Specifically, it aims to examine the perspectives of experts, funders, and fundraisers to provide several applicable recommendations to accelerate the outreach. An initial framework has been developed to fit with the developing economies; experts from Jordan were meet to validate the framework suitability; two questionnaires were developed for funders and fundraisers; crowdfunding experts from more than 10 countries worldwide reviewed and validated the methodology and the questionnaires; 833 questionnaires were collected, coded, and analyzed; analysis and statistical tests validated by statistical academic and analysis specialists. Outcomes affirm the importance of crowdfunding outreach proposed factors in developing economies with a variation between concerned parties: Experts emphasize "supervision and a regulatory framework"; funders focus on "Openness and Transparency"; and fundraisers focus on "Financial Knowledge" as essential factors to the outreach of these platforms. This study focused on the "Debit -based" and "Equity -based" crowdfunding platforms. Therefore, some findings may not be generalized to the "Donation -based" and "Reward -based" platforms. Several applicable recommendations have been suggested.

TI  - An Assessment Model for Wealth Management Banks Based on the Fuzzy Evaluation Method
T2  - MATHEMATICS
AB  - COVID-19 has led people to question numerous aspects of life, including family budgetary arrangements and wealth management. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown many of us a financial curveball. Managing personal finances is important, particularly during a crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the economic consequences are evident, financially induced stress caused by uncertainty is less visible. Individual wealth increments and firm size measures have brought a commensurate increment in their respective resources. Thus, monitoring these resources and coordinate investment exercises is necessary to preserve resource development. The best method to improve wealth management banks is to consider competitive preferences by designating a set of wealth management bank selections to oversee individuals' wealth viably. This paper provides a step-by-step assessment guide for wealth management banks using multiple-criteria decision-making to illustrate the appropriateness of the proposed technique. We found that the two primary aspects of wealth management bank evaluations are transaction safety and professional financial knowledge. The proposed approach is relatively straightforward and appropriate for such key decision-making issues.

TI  - Does Financial Literacy Affect Household Financial Behavior? The Role of Limited Attention
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Financial literacy is essential for every individual concerned with public welfare and household portfolio choices. In this study, we investigate the impact of household financial literacy on individuals' financial behavior using the China Household Financial Survey Data (CHFS) of 2015 and 2017. The results show that financial knowledge has significant current, long-term, and dynamic effects on financial behavior. This finding suggests that financial literacy is an important factor in shaping and improving financial behavior. Second, financial literacy can improve residents' limited attention, and residents with high attention tend to have formal bank accounts, participate in the stock market, and engage in financial behaviors in situations such as risky financial markets. High attention also helps to improve residents' financial behavior. This relationship suggests that financial literacy positively impacts formal bank account holding, participation in financial markets, participation in commercial insurance, participation in pension plans, and credit card holdings through limited attention channels that facilitate access to specific financial information. In addition, heterogeneity analysis showed that the impact of financial literacy on financial behavior differs significantly between urban and rural households, between men and women, and between high and low education levels. The study provides valuable insights for policy implications to enhance financial literacy, such as carrying out financial training to improve residents' knowledge about financial aspects, which further helps to optimize household financial decision-making.

TI  - Influence of financial literacy on investment decisions of managers of small and medium enterprises in Mogadishu, Somalia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES
AB  - This research aimed to explore how well managers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Mogadishu, Somalia, understand financial concepts such as savings, managing debt, handling financial risks, and planning for retirement, and how this understanding affects their investment decisions. The background of the study highlights that many SMEs in Mogadishu struggle to sustain their operations, with low profits or failure often due to poor investment choices. To investigate the link between financial literacy and investment decision -making among these managers, the study was based on the principles of modern portfolio theory. The research used a correlational design to analyze data from 250 targeted SMEs, with 154 respondents selected through stratified random sampling. Data collection was facilitated by questionnaires, and the analysis involved calculating means, standard deviations, and conducting regression analysis. The findings indicated that among the financial literacy components, debt management had the most significant impact on investment decisions (beta=0.490, p<0.05), followed by financial risk management (beta=0.137, p<0.05), and lastly, the ability to save (beta=0.128, p<0.05). The study concluded that financial literacy plays a crucial role in influencing investment decisions among SME managers in Mogadishu, suggesting that improving financial knowledge could lead to better business outcomes.

TI  - Enhancing Inclusive Finance in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Collaborative Role of Economic Freedom and Innovative Facilities
T2  - THUNDERBIRD INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - This paper gives insight into innovative facilities' role in the effect of economic freedom on inclusive finance in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) using data from 2008 to 2020. After using the generalized method of moment for the analysis, the study concluded that improving economic freedom promotes financial inclusion while expanding innovative facilities in SSA inhibits inclusive finance. The study also discovered that innovative facilities improve the impact of economic freedom on inclusive finance in SSA and subsequently diminish the effect of economic freedom on inclusive finance after certain thresholds (mobile usage 100.75, internet usage 34.1064, fixed broadband usage not applicable, telephone usage 13.3494, and innovative facility index 1.5619). Hence, policymakers are advised to increase freedom in SSA economies to boost financial inclusion by ensuring the bureaucracy for establishing financial institutions is minimized and institutions that ensure property rights and free will are instituted to encourage people to participate in financial services. When it comes to using innovative facilities to enhance freedom-induced inclusivity in finance, technical and financial knowledge should be enhanced in addition to lowering the cost of using innovative facilities to access financial services in order to eliminate the threshold levels at which innovative facilities reduce inclusive finance SSA.

TI  - Consumer debt attitudes: The role of gender, debt knowledge and skills
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - The link between financial attitudes and consumer financial market behaviour is well documented. However, little is known about the role of financial knowledge and skills-the main components of the financial literacy construct-in shaping debt attitudes. This link is especially absent from the gender perspective. This study focuses on consumer debt literacy and debt attitudes. A representative sample of adult Poles (N = 1,004) was participated in a computer-assisted telephone interview. Latent class analysis was employed to reveal their debt attitudes, and subsequently, links between debt literacy and debt attitudes were studied with multinomial regression models. The results show that respondents in Poland can be grouped into five classes exhibiting different attitude profiles. The structure of debt attitudes is complex and differs from a simple unidimensional pro-debt/ anti-debt construct. Although this study did not find significant gender differences either in the conceptualization of debt attitudes or in their drivers, the results showed that in all but one class, consumer attitudes are strongly linked to either debt knowledge or debt skills or to both. Debt skills were revealed to be a particularly strong predictor of consumer debt attitudes.

TI  - Financial literacy, trust and retirement planning
T2  - JOURNAL OF PENSION ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - We study the complex relationship between financial literacy, retirement planning and trust in financial institutions, using data from the 2010 Bank of Italy Survey on Household Income and Wealth. The impact of financial literacy on retirement planning is a well-established issue in the existing empirical literature; our main contribution is proving that financial knowledge not only impacts retirement planning, but also the decisions of entering a private pension scheme (or devoting the severance pay to a private pension scheme). Adding the consideration of trust poses serious econometric concerns, since both financial literacy and trust in financial institutions are likely to be endogenous and the presence of two endogenous regressors renders the identification of causality very difficult. Our solution is to keep only financial literacy as endogenous and include in our models an exogenous regional indicator of social capital (similar to the one adopted by Guiso et al., 2004), as a proxy for the level of trust between the counterparts of a financial contract in each geographical area. Our main findings show that trust has a positive influence on both the decisions to enter a private pension scheme or to devote the severance pay to a private pension scheme.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of the Effects of Objective and Self-Assessed Financial Literacy on Stock Investment Return
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Till now, comprehensive and quantitatively meaningful analyses of stock market participation outcomes of retail investors have been limited by data sources in developing countries. This article devised a special questionnaire related to stock investment to measure the financial literacy (FL) and stock investment return (SIR) for the subjects with stockownership in China and to theoretically and empirically study the effects of objective FL, self-assessed FL, and their composite FL on SIR. The results of the comparative analysis showed that self-assessed FL has a greater effect on SIR than objective FL, and the effect is mediated by risk preference. In addition, we found that competent and overconfident respondents have higher SIR, while under confident respondents cannot gain from the stock market. We also found that risk preference has a positive mediating effect in the relationship between competence and overconfidence and SIR, and a negative mediating effect in the relationship between under confidence and SIR. We thus concluded that confident investors can gain more stockholding returns via taking more risks regardless of the level of their actual financial knowledge. Our findings would be a meaningful complement to the studies of stock market participation.

TI  - The primacy of demand and financial obstacles in hindering innovation*
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - We study the effects of different types of obstacles to innovation on the probability of obtaining different firmlevel innovation outcomes. We consider financial, knowledge, cooperation, regulatory and demand-related obstacles, which we separate into two categories: market structure and lack or uncertainty about demand. Using a pooled sample of four Chilean innovation surveys and an instrumental variables approach novel to this literature to address endogeneity, we find that only demand and financial barriers seem to have a negative effect on the probability of generating innovations. When financial or demand barriers are present, they seem to be binding and take prevalence over all other obstacles, and when they are absent, other barriers become significant. We provide evidence of heterogeneous effects on different sectors, considering not only manufacturing and services but also primaries, a comparison that has not been previously conducted and holds relevance for developing economies. We show that knowledge obstacles are relevant to manufacturing and market structure and regulatory obstacles are relevant in the services sector, while demand and financial obstacles appear to matter across the board. The pervasiveness of financial and demand obstacles, their relationship with the remaining barriers, and the observed sectoral differences have important policy implications.

T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has considerably promoted the usage of Digital Financial Services (DFS) in India. Therefore, exploring the various determinants influencing the DFS users is crucial for the DFS providers to understand their customers better. This study aims to identify, measure, and validate the determinants of Digital Financial Literacy (DFL) from the Indian adults who use Digital Financial Services. A sample of 384 adult DFS users from India was surveyed using a self-administered questionnaire in 2021. A multidimensional scale was developed to measure the Digital Financial Literacy in this study. The results exhibit that Digital Knowledge, Financial Knowledge, Knowledge of DFS, Awareness of Digital Finance Risk, Digital Finance Risk Control, Knowledge of Customer Right, Product Suitability, Product Quality, Gendered Social Norm, Practical Application of Knowledge and Skill, Self-determination to use the Knowledge and Skill and Decision Making are the determinants of DFL among the adults in India. Further, the users of DFS without DFL will face numerous challenges such as inability to complete the transaction, financial loss and privacy breach, etc. Hence, the study concludes that DFL is prerequisite to use DFS effectively.

TI  - Application of improved clustering algorithm in investment recommendation in embedded system
T2  - MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS
AB  - The user's investment behaviour is individual, and group-oriented, which can reflect the user's cognitive background and interest on a certain extent. The user investment group can help users to find similar investment partners. Users can view the investment or other related people's interests. With the development of the Internet financial industry, people's demand for Internet financial knowledge services has become increasingly strong. Accessing financial information and conducting financial transactions through online financial platforms has become normal for investors. As a popular research area, the recommendation system can help users to better use Internet information, improve user loyalty, and promote products. In this paper, an improved kernel cluster-based incremental clustering method is proposed, and the stock information of the Shanghai Stock Exchange is used as the experimental data for cluster mining. The experimental results show that the improved kernel-based incremental clustering algorithm proposed in this paper can complete the investment recommendation for financial users. For a certain extent, it reduces the risk of financial investment, enhances the stability of the financial market, and has a strong positive effect. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The subjective well-being of self-employed persons: a national survey evidence from Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose This study aims to examine the subjective well-being of self-employed persons relative to wage employees in Ghana. Two measures of subjective well-being, comprising life satisfaction and happiness, are considered. Design/methodology/approach The current study focuses on Ghanaian working adults, uses pooled cross-sectional datasets from the 2005 to 2014 World Values Survey (WVS), applies survey weights, estimates ordered probit models and computes marginal effects. Findings The results show that being self-employed is associated with a lower probability of being satisfied with life than being wage employed. The result for happiness is negative but not statistically significant. The perceived low level of life satisfaction among the self-employed in Ghana could explain the rationale behind the desire of some Ghanaians to seek wage employment rather than pursuing self-employment. The results also could partly explain the non-survival of some entrepreneurial firms in Ghana over time. Research limitations/implications Data relating to factors such as business size, location (urban or rural), degree of internationalization (domestic or foreign), number of years of being in self-employment, the number of employees, financial knowledge and behavior and personality traits are unavailable in the WVS for analyses. The present study also uses a pooled cross-sectional dataset for the analyses; thus, causal inferences are not possible. Originality/value The study provides empirical evidence on the relationship between self-employment and subjective well-being in the context of Ghana. The study provides insights into how self-employed Ghanaians perceive well-being relative to wage employees.

TI  - The Effect of Expected Income on Wealth Accumulation and Retirement Contribution of Thai Wageworkers
T2  - SAGE OPEN
AB  - Thailand has now become the aging society. However, the fact that the majority of Thai wageworkers do not effectively save for their retirement may result in several elderly living below the poverty threshold during retirement. The objectives of this research article were to find the factors determining Thai wageworkers' retirement contribution. Founded on the theory of life-cycle hypothesis, this article employed a sample of 300 wageworkers in the Northeast of Thailand and performed a statistical analysis using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach using age as a moderator. The empirical results revealed that expected income, wealth accumulation, career status, and health status were the main constructs influencing an individual's ability to contribute to his or her retirement. This article suggested that a wageworker should first contribute his or her income through wealth accumulation schemes such as investment in financial assets, for example, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and properties, investment in other business as a second job, and simply cash deposit. The results suggested that wealth accumulation was the most important mediator allowing a wageworker to contribute to retirement effectively in the long term. This article also proposed thoughtful research implications for wageworkers, employers, and the Thai government. This article recommended that the government and authorized bodies (e.g., the Bank of Thailand and the Stock Exchange of Thailand) should provide more investment alternatives and improve investment knowledge of the citizens. This would allow the citizens to have sufficient financial knowledge to invest in riskier financial instruments that potentially give better returns such as stocks.

TI  - The Implication of IFRS Financial Instruments Disclosure on Value Relevance
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The main objective of this research is to examine the effects of financial instruments declared under IFRSs on value relevance over thirteen years. The research sample included 35 European enterprises that were listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange from 2007 to 2019. This study focuses on the adoption of IFRS.7 and IAS.32 disclosure standards, in line with previous studies. The Ohlson model (1995) was utilised in the study to evaluate the dependent variable since it is the module used most often in determining value relevance. The findings indicated that financial knowledge about financial instruments (FI) was typically valuable throughout the research. In addition, the significance of financial instruments and other disclosures when examining sub-components were not valued as relevant but rather provided information regarding the kind and level of exposure to FI risks. Furthermore, the earnings and book value of the common equity have a favourable impact on the value relevance. Hence, the key contributions of this study went beyond enriching the body of literature to make recommendations regarding the most influential determinant among financial instrument items that positively enhance value relevance.

TI  - Financial literacy and financial well-being among generation-Z university students: Evidence from Greece
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB  - Financial knowledge has become an essential skill because of the instability of global markets, asymmetric information in those markets, increasing complexity of financial products, and the rapidly increasing growth in financial technology (Fintech). This study aims to be the first among its kind to evaluate the relation between financial literacy, financial fragility, and financial well-being in parallel with identifying their determinants. For this purpose, we design and distribute a questionnaire to a random sample of 456 university students in Greece. The university students represent Generation Z that experienced the effects of a unique in duration and consequences financial crisis. We analyze the data by using cross-tabulations, chi-square tests, logistic regressions, and a marginal effect analysis. The results show that male students, students who keep expense records, or their father is highly educated are more financially literate. We also examine the dimensions of financial fragility, and the results show that financially literate students are better able to cope with an unexpected financial shock. Thus, financial literacy can be a key driver of financial well-being among Greek university students. Furthermore, we discuss the likely policy prescriptions while accounting for related behavioral aspects and technological developments.

TI  - What hampers innovation in Mexican family firms?
T2  - ACADEMIA-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ADMINISTRACION
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore to what extent different obstacles (financial, knowledge, market, and perception) affect the propensity of Mexican family firms to engage in innovation activity. Second, it examines whether the perception of these obstacles differs between two subgroups of family firms, considering levels of ownership and family management control.
   Design/methodology/approach - Information was gathered through a CIS methodology-based questionnaire applied to 161 CEOs of Mexican family firms. Binomial logistic regressions were performed identifying obstacles that were truly relevant for the family firm subgroups in the sample.
   Findings - For subgroup 1, knowledge and market factors were significant and negatively related to the propensity to engage in innovation activities; for subgroup 2, only market factors were relevant. The results also show how the tenure of the CEO, the number of generations involved, and the family involvement in management and non-management positions affect the results obtained.
   Practical implications - Implications for family business scholars embrace the assessment criteria of different family business definitions. While the implications for managers and policy makers include the recognition of the factors that affect innovation in Mexican family firms in order to design and implement adequate strategies to overcome them.
   Originality/value - This study addresses some of the raised demands in the literature. First, to the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the first attempt to explore the factors hampering innovation in family firms in Latin America. Second, this study was undertaken in response to the call for exploring variations in innovation behavior across different family business types in regards to ownership and family management control. Moreover, this study responds to the call to analyze financial and non-financial factors separately and to expand the geographical areas, sectors, and sizes of family firms, more specifically in Latin America.

TI  - To trust is good, but to control is better: How investors discipline financial advisors' activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB  - Using a survey of clients from one of the largest Italian banks, we find that investors with low level of trust in professional advisors seek financial counselling, but make their decisions autonomously. We investigate whether these investors exert some form of control over the recommendations they receive, and, if so, which one. Investors can push advisors to provide better recommendations either by asking for a second expert's opinion, such as in the case of credence services, or by monitoring closely the advisor's activity themselves. We find that three quarters of investors do not exert any control on advisors. Different types of financial competence-self-assessed or test-based-serve different purposes. The investors featuring higher self-assessed financial competence are more likely to control the advisor's activity. The mechanism through which investors exert control over the advisors' activity depends instead on the investors' degree of test-based financial literacy. Investors with high financial literacy directly monitor the advisors' activity. Investors with low financial literacy are more likely to seek a second professional opinion in support of the recommendations previously received. Our findings suggest that improving investors financial knowledge may foster direct control of the advisor's activity. Moreover, facilitating the comparison between financial products by standardized and centralized information may be very effective to protect poorly literate investors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Role of Working Women in Investment Decision Making in the Family in India
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN ACCOUNTING BUSINESS AND FINANCE JOURNAL
AB  - The contribution of Indian women in family, businesses and society is today being recognized. The role of women in the family decisions is also increasing with the change in demographics as more women are now participating in economic activities. With the change in education, employment and contribution in the earnings of the family, her say in the family decisions are increasing. When it comes to the investment decisions, women tend to be risk averse, have conservative attitude, lower levels of financial knowledge, lack of confidence and dependent on guidance from others as suggested by different researches worldwide. The role of husband becomes particularly important for women while choosing investment products or taking investment decisions. This article attempts to highlight the role of women in investment decision making in the family and further examines the role of a male spouse on the investment decisions. The objectives of the study were to examine the behavior of working women while taking investment decisions; and to identify the extent to which the investment decisions of the working women are influenced by the spouse/husband. The article further highlights that, when it comes to investment decisions, both husband and wife share responsibility for making investment decisions. There are investment products like Bank deposits, 5 year tax saving FDs, precious metals, public provident fund, national pension system, post office saving schemes, mutual funds, life insurance, and commodities, where the influence of women is stronger than their male spouse. The influence of a male spouse is stronger in products like real estate, company deposits, debentures or bonds, pension schemes, equity shares and derivatives.

TI  - Investigating alternative avenues for financial behaviour change: moving beyond the traditional approach
T2  - YOUNG CONSUMERS
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to explore possible behavioural change venues, beyond the traditional approach to financial education, using the capability-opportunity-motivation behaviour theoretical framework of behavioural change.Design/methodology/approachThe study included 45, semi-structured, in-depth interviews of young adults to explore which elements of financial behaviour formation should interventions target to be effective.FindingsTo strengthen capability, the study recommends behavioural education and training for boosting financial knowledge and skills, enablement of financial independence and modelling for empowering self-control and reducing impulsiveness. To boost motivation, gamification of modelling is advised for boosting responsible financial behaviour as part of the identity and inducing consideration of future consequences. Persuasion is advised for inducing positive emotions while incentivization and coercion are advised for empowering self-conscious intentions. To rise opportunity, the study proposes incentivization and coercion imposed by parents, and governmental efforts regarding restriction, enablement and environmental restructuring.Practical implicationsThe study brings recommendations for developing efficient interventions for strengthening responsible financial behaviour that may help design type-specific education programmes to promote responsible financial behaviour.Originality/valueThe present study attempts to explore new venues in intervention design that break away from the traditional approach of financial education focused on knowledge and skills that is proven to be ineffective

TI  - Sustainable Financial Education and Consumer Life Satisfaction
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Sustainable financial education is defined as the continuous input of money and time on financial knowledge education after formal schooling. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of sustainable financial education on consumer life satisfaction. Utilizing the dataset of Household Consumer Finance of Chinese Urban Residents in 2012 by the China Financial Research Center of Tsinghua University, the variable of sustainable financial education is constructed through the variables of the necessity of financial education, the money spent on financial education, and the time spent on financial education. To improve the estimation results, order probit regression is utilized. The results indicate that financial education is significantly positive to consumer life satisfaction only for a consumer with higher education. Consumers who regard financial education to be of high necessity will feel more satisfied. The results also show that consumers who spend more money and time on financial education after formal schooling will be more satisfied. Moreover, the sustainable impacts of financial education on consumer life satisfaction are verified. In addition, this study provides empirical evidence that suggests that sustainable financial education positively contributes to consumer life satisfaction. The results have implications for policymakers to take measures in enhancing sustainable financial education to improve consumer life satisfaction.

T2  - JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to establish a systematic cognition to alleviate the supply-demand contradiction in rural financial markets from an integrated perspective of knowledge management and proposes the concept of rural financial knowledge ecosystem (RFKE) to encourage multifaceted solutions. Design/methodology/approach The authors qualitatively describe the process that the knowledge management dilemmas cause the supply-demand contradiction in the rural finance and further summarize a systematic methodology from three dimensions: the knowledge subject, the knowledge environment and the knowledge ecology. Findings The authors list four types of knowledge management dilemmas leading to the supply-demand contradiction in the rural finance, i.e. the weak knowledge sharing, the poor knowledge flow, the slow knowledge updating and the imperfect knowledge environment. Meanwhile, the RFKE model consisting of the ecological subject, the ecological environment and the ecological regulation is also presented. Research limitations/implications The role of knowledge management in improving the allocation of financial resources to various rural financial market participants (government, rural financial institutions, farmers, agricultural enterprises, etc.). Originality/value The authors creatively give the RFKE model, which complements and enriches the theory of knowledge management. Meanwhile, relevant management practices are urgently needed under the macro circumstance of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rural revitalization in China.

TI  - Why do older adults avoid seeking financial advice? Adviser anxiety in the Netherlands
T2  - AGEING & SOCIETY
AB  - Why is it that many people fail to seek retirement planning advice when doing so is clearly indicated? Distrust of financial intermediaries is often presented as the common answer. But this paper shows that trust issues are only part of the answer; an appreciable proportion of individuals experience anxiety at the prospect of visiting a financial adviser. In the present investigation, financial adviser anxiety is studied among 950 Dutch adults over the age of 50. Anxiety levels were measured using a six-item scale that was administered as part of a larger nationwide investigation on retirement attitudes and behaviour. Findings revealed that nearly one-third of respondents reported having moderate to severe levels of anxiety at the prospect of visiting a financial professional. Furthermore, a hierarchical regression analysis revealed that strong predictors of anxiety included one's educational level, income, age, level of future time perspective, risk tolerance, financial knowledge and scepticism regarding whether advice from a financial professional can be trusted. A cluster analysis using demographic and psychological covariates identified three separate groups of older adults that were found to differ in terms of their mean level of anxiety. Those who had low levels of education and low incomes were found to disproportionately display high levels of financial adviser anxiety.

TI  - Economic Education, Digital Literacy and Intention to Invest Among Students: The Mediating Role of Financial Attitudes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INSTRUCTION
AB  - The pandemic has raised the students' activities in finding income, ranging from entrepreneurship to investing intention. This study aims to determine the role of economic education and digital literacy on student investment interest in universities during the Covid-19 period. In the analytical model proposed, it is assumed that the financial attitude variable is a mediating variable in education and financial knowledge in investment intentions. Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior and Bandura's Social Learning Theory was developed for the research model. The research adopted quantitative methods using survey research data from saturated sampling techniques. The participants in this study were students of Universitas Negeri Jakarta who are members of the Indonesian stock exchange investment gallery organization. From the 234 proposed questionnaires, 203 questionnaires were returned and filled out completely for data analysis. The study results confirmed the three hypotheses and rejected the four proposed hypotheses. Economic education affects student investment intentions and significantly affects financial attitudes. However, digital literacy affects students' investment intentions but fails to shape investment intentions through financial attitudes. Another finding is that economic education and digital literacy have no effect on shaping financial attitudes, but financial attitudes influence students' investment intentions during the pandemic.

TI  - Students and Money Management Behavior of a Malaysian Public University
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN FINANCE ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB  - This study aims to investigate whether financial literacy, parental socialization, peer influence and self-control have a significant impact on money management among students of a Malaysian public university. In most settings, the studies on the determinants of personal saving behavior among university students focus on personality factors, attitudes toward money and possessions, and financial knowledge as predictors of money management behavior. Primary data are collected using a self-administered questionnaire with the samples comprised 186 students. The findings show that all the financial literacy and parent socialization have a positive relationship with money management; meanwhile, peer influences and self-control have a negative relationship with money management. This is because the majority of students admit they cannot control their self in managing their money. In this study, parent socialization has a significant relationship with money management which signifies that parents are playing essential roles in ensuring their children to establish money management. In practical, this study can contribute to the parents in providing their children to foster sound money management. Besides, Perbadanan Tabung Pendidikan Tinggi Nasional (National Higher Education Fund Corporation) PTPTN should monitor the loan, and management process and arrange motivational program so that students can more focus on the educational expense.

TI  - Financial literacy or investment experience: which is more influential in cryptocurrency investment?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate how financial literacy and investment experience impact cryptocurrency investment behavior and explore which factor is more influential in cryptocurrency investment. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of US individual investors from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study Investor Survey, a three-step hierarchical logistic regression was conducted following a model-comparison approach. In addition, a mediation analysis was conducted using the Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) method to further explore the mediating effect of investment experience between financial literacy and cryptocurrency investment. Findings This study found that while both financial literacy and investment experience were positively associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, investment experience was more influential in cryptocurrency investment. The findings also demonstrated that investment experience, especially risky asset holding, had a significant mediating effect between subjective financial knowledge and cryptocurrency investment behavior. Practical implications The findings of this study offer insight to researchers by providing a deeper understanding of the determinants of cryptocurrency investment in the United States. This study also provides detailed implications for financial institutions, financial professionals and policymakers to guide rational cryptocurrency investment behavior. Originality/value This study is one of the initial attempts to explore the determinant factors in cryptocurrency investment, an area that has rarely been studied in the literature.

TI  - Financial Literacy on High School Students. How is Their Performance if Study and Work?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The aim of the study is to analyze the financial knowledge of high school students in Mexico; its relationship with the student's age, gender, and condition of studying and working. The study is a non-experimental quantitative, descriptive, exploratory, and correlational cross-sectional study. Through a non-probabilistic sampling by self-determination, the total participants were 423 students enrolled in three institutions of Higher Education, all belonging to the state of Oaxaca. For the application of the instrument, we had the support of some teachers to share a link to Google forms. In order to determine the relationship between financial literacy (FL) and other sociodemographic variables (gender, age, and employment status), a dichotomous Probit model is used. The results show low financial literacy of the students, who only a fifth understand the concepts of compound interest, inflation, and diversification; no gender difference was identified in this age group. The significant effect of the interaction variable (gender and condition of studying and working) on the probability of understanding the effect of inflation on purchasing power is evident. Therefore, the results obtained can contribute to the design of financial education (FE) programs for young people at an early age that allows them to make informed financial decisions in any aspect of their personal and work life.

AB  - Exploring the financial behavior traits amidst the unexpected financial challenges and the unparalleled rise in fintech, this study provides insight into the interplay of entrepreneur digital financial literacy (EDFL), entrepreneur financial competency (EFC), and entrepreneur financial skill (EFS) impacting entrepreneur financial decision-making (EFDM). Toward this goal, data were gathered from 223 active women entrepreneurs from India who have accounts in the social media platform. The three-step hierarchical regression analysis disclosed that an entrepreneur with sound EDFL, EFS, and EFC can significantly enhance strategic decision-making (EFDM). The research outcome reveals that EFDM is a consistent predictor of the financial performance of women-owned enterprises. In addition, the entrepreneur's financial decision-making does not mediate the relationship between financial experience, financial competency, financial skill budgeting, and financial skill_acumen with financial performance. In contrast, partial mediation is observed between digital financial awareness, digital financial knowledge, and financial skill_analytics. The novel insight accounted for a significantly low level of experience in entrepreneurs' utilization of digital platforms for payment, financing loans, and asset management. The outcome carries academic, regulatory, and managerial significance, recognizing the unique interaction; the cumulative efforts strengthen the capacity to address socio-economic challenges and translate them into gender-specific policy interventions and practices.

TI  - Quantifying loss aversion: Evidence from a UK population survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY
AB  - We quantify differences in attitudes to loss from individuals with different demographic, personal and socio-economic characteristics. Our data are based on responses from an online survey of a representative sample of over 4000 UK residents and allow us to produce the most comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneity of loss aversion measures to date. Using the canonical model proposed by Tversky and Kahneman (1992), we show that responses for the population as a whole differ substantially from those typically provided by students (who form the basis of many existing studies of loss aversion). The average aversion to a loss of 500 pound relative to a gain of the same amount is 2.41, but loss aversion correlates significantly with characteristics such as gender, age, education, financial knowledge, social class, employment status, management responsibility, income, savings and home ownership. Other related factors include marital status, number of children, ease of savings, rainy day fund, personality type, emotional state, newspaper and political party. However, once we condition on all the profiling characteristics of the respondents, some factors, in particular gender, cease to be significant, suggesting that gender differences in risk and loss attitudes might be due to other factors, such as income differences.

TI  - Fashion entrepreneurial self-efficacy: development and validation of a domain-specific scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this research is to develop a multidimensional measurement of fashion domain entrepreneurial self-efficacy (FDESE) based on which fashion entrepreneurs will be able to better develop strategies to gain and sustain success in their business development. The research is crucial to advocate fashion entrepreneurship and will provide direction for fashion business incubation services. Design/methodology/approach This research included three stages with mixed qualitative and quantitative approaches: conceptualizing construct definition and specifying domain(s) to generate initial items, scale purification and scale validation. This study started with reviewing the literature and individual interviews among 19 fashion entrepreneurs, which generated 72 initial items. An online survey was then conducted with individuals who are running or have the intention to run fashion businesses, yielding 249 useable samples for scale purification, which generated 21 items for the validation phase. Lastly, another online survey was administered to individuals who are currently running fashion businesses which resulted in 258 valid responses included for scale validation. Findings A measure of FDESE that is both reliable and valid was developed, including 21 items across four distinct dimensions: passion for fashion business (five items), marketing and branding (seven items), financial management (five items) and creativity (four items). Originality/value This study is the first attempt to develop practical scales measuring self-efficacy that focus on fashion domain entrepreneurship. The newly developed FDESE scale indicates that entrepreneurship not only involves marketing skills, financial knowledge, creativity, leadership, and proactivity but also requires passion and persistence.

TI  - What is the connection between Fintechs' video marketing and their vulnerable customers' brand engagement during crises?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The paper's main goal is to examine the relationship between the video marketing of financial technologies (Fintechs) and their vulnerable website customers' brand engagement in the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis.
   Design/methodology/approach - To extract the required outcomes, the authors gathered data from the five biggest Fintech websites and YouTube channels, performed multiple linear regression models and developed a hybrid (agent-based and dynamic) model to assess the performance connection between their video marketing analytics and vulnerable website customers' brand engagement.
   Findings - It has been found that video marketing analytics of Fintechs' YouTube channels are a decisive factor in impacting their vulnerable website customers' brand engagement and awareness.
   Research limitations/implications - By enhancing video marketing analytics of their YouTube channels, Fintechs can achieve greater levels of vulnerable website customers' engagement and awareness. Higher levels of vulnerable customers' brand engagement and awareness tend to decrease their vulnerability by enhancing their financial knowledge and confidence.
   Practical implications - Fintechs should aim to increase the number of total videos on their YouTube channels and provide videos that promote their customers' knowledge of their services to increase their brand engagement and awareness, thus reducing their vulnerability. Moreover, Fintechs should be aware not to over-post videos because they will be in an unfavorable position against their competitors.
   Originality/value - This research offers valuable insights regarding the importance of video marketing strategies for Fintechs in promoting their vulnerable website customers' brand awareness during crisis periods.

TI  - Demographic characteristics influencing financial wellbeing: a multigroup analysis
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose The study attempts to understand the factors impacting the financial wellbeing of IT employees in India using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). It utilizes well-established survey instruments to assess the impact of financial literacy, financial behaviour and financial stress on financial wellbeing. The study also attempts to understand the role of demographic factors (age, gender, monthly income, job category and work experience) in determining financial wellbeing through multigroup analysis. Design/methodology/approach Structured equation modelling (SEM) is used to study the link between the determinants. The study also attempts to understand the role of demographic factors (age, gender, monthly income, job category and work experience) in determining financial wellbeing through multigroup analysis. Data used for the analysis covers 237 employees working in the IT sector. Findings While financial literacy and financial behaviour have a significant positive impact on financial wellbeing, financial stress has a significant negative impact. Financial behaviour and financial stress were found to have a mediating role in the relationship between financial literacy and financial wellbeing. The demographic variables significantly moderate the relationship between the factors leading to financial wellbeing. Originality/value The results show the need for financial wellbeing programs to focus on enhancing financial knowledge and improving financial planning. Further, it suggests offering customized financial wellbeing programs based on the employee's demographic characteristics rather than following a "one program, fits all" approach.

TI  - Board Composition and Corporate Performance: X-raying the Nexus in Nigerian Banks
T2  - GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - We investigate the nexus between board composition and corporate performance of Nigerian banks listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) from 2010 to 2019. The contextual board characteristics of empirical interest include board size, financial knowledge of board members, frequency of board meetings, gender diversity and board independence. Corporate performance is measured by return on equity (ROE) and earnings per share (EPS). Our findings lead to the predictions that board size, financial nous of board members, gender diversity and board independence are important board characteristics that catalyse corporate performance, although the evidence of gender diversity and board independence is limited. We find no robust relation between the frequency of board meetings and corporate performance. Our findings affirm the plurality of governance theories. Although board characteristics are in aggregate perceived to be a strong determinant of firm performance, however, their disaggregation depicts differential effects on the performance of Nigerian banks. The study contributes to (a) empirical validation of theoretical pluralism to gain more insights into the dimensions of corporate governance, and (b) greater understanding of the nexus between board composition and corporate performance through the lens of both financial and nonfinancial factors. The fact that some board characteristics exhibit no or partial relations with firm performance suggests further research in and regulatory attention to the relations between board structure and optimal size for efficient corporate performance.

TI  - MODERN STATE AND POST-WAR PROSPECTS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN UKRAINE CONSIDERING THE EU EXPERIENCE
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - The purpose of the article is theoretical and methodological substantiation of the state and post-war prospects of financial inclusion in Ukraine, taking into account the experience of EU countries. The objectives of the study are as follows: to theoretically substantiate the content and features of financial inclusion, taking into account the experience of EU countries; to assess the current state of financial inclusion; and to outline post-war prospects for the development of financial inclusion in Ukraine. It is argued that the key parameters of financial inclusion are financial well-being, financial behaviour, financial knowledge, and the utilization of financial products, as well as physical access to financial services. Drawing on the experience of EU countries, it is substantiated that creating conditions for free access to financial services for all categories of the population and businesses, as well as their digitalization, contribute to the growth of citizens' income, the simplification of investment mechanisms, and thus the economic development of the country. An assessment of the state of financial inclusion in Ukraine is conducted through online surveys of various categories of citizens. It is determined that Ukrainians feel a strong need for additional sources of income, and the financial situation of the majority of them is extremely unstable. Based on the results of correlation-regression analysis, the priorities of financial inclusion are identified as the level of financial literacy and competency among the population. This will enable them to budget their income and expenses, promote the transformation of savings into investments, and have a positive impact on the post-war recovery of the country's economy.

TI  - Five steps to planning success: experimental evidence from US households
T2  - OXFORD REVIEW OF ECONOMIC POLICY
AB  - While financial knowledge has been linked to improved financial behaviour, there is little consensus on the value of financial education, in part because rigorous evaluation of various programmes has yielded mixed results. However, given the heterogeneity of financial education programmes in the literature, focusing on 'generic' financial education can be inappropriate and even misleading. Lusardi (2009) and others argue that pedagogy and delivery matter significantly. In this paper, we design and field a low-cost, easily-replicable financial education programme called 'Five Steps', covering five basic financial planning concepts that relate to retirement. We conduct a field experiment to evaluate the overall impact of Five Steps on a probability sample of the American population. In different treatment arms, we quantify the relative impact of delivering the programme through video and narrative formats. Our results show that short videos and narratives (each takes about 3 minutes) have sizeable short-run effects on objective measures of respondent knowledge. Moreover, keeping informational content relatively constant, format has significant effects on other psychological levers of behavioural change: effects on self-efficacy are significantly higher when videos are used, which ultimately influences knowledge acquisition. Follow-up tests of respondents' knowledge approximately 8 months after the interventions suggest that between one-quarter and one-third of the knowledge gain and about one-fifth of the self-efficacy gain persist. Thus, this simple programme has effects both in the short run and medium run.

TI  - Board diversity and working capital management strategies: evidence from energy sector of Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose This study investigates the mediating role of working capital management (WCM) efficiency between board diversity (based on gender and financial knowledge) and firm performance. The study further examines which WCM approach (conservative, moderate, and aggressive) they employ to increase (decrease) firm performance. Design/methodology/approach The study employs listed energy firms of Pakistan over the period 2010 to 2019. The system generalized method of moments estimator and logit model are utilized to estimate the underlying relationships. Findings The results show that WCM efficiency partially mediates the relationship between board financial expertise (BFE) and firm performance. Nonetheless, the presence of female directors is merely symbolic until they reach a certain level as only the quadratic term of board gender diversity (BGD) has a significant effect on firm performance. Female directors do not influence WCM efficiency. The results also demonstrate that BGD encourages a conservative WCM approach, while BFE encourages a moderate WCM approach. Furthermore, both conservative and moderate WCM approaches are significantly associated with firm performance. Practical implications The findings hold implications for increasing the representation of women and financial experts on board to improve the capital structure decisions of the energy firms in Pakistan. Originality/value This study is the first attempt to explore the mediating role of WCM efficiency between board diversity and firm performance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous study has investigated the effect of BGD and BFE on different WCM approaches distinctly.

TI  - The influence of the cultural entrepreneur on the performance of cultural and creative firms
T2  - ACADEMIA-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE ADMINISTRACION
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse the influence of the profile of cultural entrepreneurs (CE), in terms of their demographic characteristics and resources, on the performance of cultural and creative firms (CCFs).
   Design/methodology/approach Departing from demographic theory and resource-based view, two hypotheses have been formulated and empirically tested, using a multiple regression model, with a sample of 80 Spanish CCFs. The CCF performance has been measured through two objective (employment growth and profitability) and one subjective/perceptual measurements (satisfaction of the CE with the attainment of objectives).
   Findings With respect to the demographic variables, a negative relationship between the CE's age and employment growth, and a partial positive influence of the CE's prior experience on employment growth and the subjective measurement of performance have been found. Regarding to the CE's resources, the empirical evidence shows that there is no direct relationship between the CE's possession of any resources studied - financial, knowledge and social connections - and CCF performance.
   Originality/value This work makes three important contributions as it analyses the CE and focuses on CCF management, a topic little discussed in the entrepreneurship literature. Second, there is an analysis of some of the variables pertaining to the entrepreneur's demographic profile that have been applied to top management teams and in a more or less isolated way in the entrepreneurship area. And, finally, a multidimensional measurement is used to explain the CCF performance.

TI  - Changes in rural financial exclusion's supply and demand factors from the perspective of digital inclusive financial policies
T2  - COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - This paper employs a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) methodology, utilizing data from the Chinese Household Finance Survey (CHFS), China Rural Statistical Yearbook, China Financial Yearbook, and China Statistical Yearbook. The analysis scrutinizes rural financial exclusion from dual vantage points: the demand and supply sides, with households and provinces serving as fundamental analytical units. Employing years as threshold values, we establish 27 supply-side factors and 18 demand-side factors through RDD models. This analytical framework facilitates an assessment of the existence of breakpoint effects across diverse dimensions of financial exclusion in distinct years and fosters a discourse on rural financial exclusion and its structural dynamics within the context of China's Digital Inclusive Finance policies. The findings of this study are as follows: (1) Supply-side determinants of rural financial exclusion in China have exhibited negligible change over the past decade, with Digital Inclusive Finance policies exerting limited influence. (2) Conversely, demand-side factors have exhibited some degree of variability, characterized by substantial reductions in channel exclusion and financial risk exclusion in 2013 and 2015. Digital Inclusive Finance policies have manifested a favorable impact on the demand side of rural financial exclusion. (3) In 2017, both financial knowledge exclusion and channel exclusion on the demand side of rural financial exclusion witnessed rebounded. Shifts in the orientation of Digital Inclusive Finance policies may precipitate a deterioration in the policy-dependent rural financial landscape, jeopardizing the preservation of their initial positive effects.

TI  - The Influence of Social and Personal Factors in Individual Investment Decision Making
T2  - QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB  - Research regarding relationship between social factors and investment decisions is still very rarely done. This study aims to examine the moderating relationship of polygamy risk as a social factor in the relationship between the level of risk tolerance and financial literacy in women on investment decisions in financial products. The data was collected using a survey method with 329 women as participants and married samples was women who worked in private banks and microfinance institutions. The data was classified based on the respondents' risk tolerance, financial literacy, and risk perception of polygamy. MANOVA Techniques were used to test the research model. The test results found that the risk of polygamy moderates the relationship between women in high-risk tolerance conditions. It shows that within the high risk of polygamy conditions, women's preference for short-term financial investment products is higher than in low-level risk polygamy conditions. The group of women with expert financial knowledge and a higher risk tolerance who choose to invest in short-term financial products as The moderating variable of polygamy can be considered as a social risk that cannot be controlled and is affected by the main effects of financial literacy and risk tolerance, where women naturally behave as risk averse in order to maintain a stable life and prosperity. Short-term investments have low returns, but they can be sold at any time and turned into cash, making them the most liquid assets.

TI  - Knowledge creates value: the role of financial literacy in entrepreneurial behavior
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Under the backdrop of economic globalization and the digital economy, entrepreneurial behavior has emerged not only as a focal point of management research but also as an urgent topic within the domain of family finance. This paper scrutinizes the ramifications of financial literacy on household entrepreneurial behavior utilizing data from China's sample of the China Household Finance Survey spanning the years 2015 and 2017. Employing the ordered Probit model, we pursue our research objectives. Our findings suggest that financial literacy exerts immediate, persistent, and evolving positive effects on households' engagement in entrepreneurial activities and their proclivity toward entrepreneurship. Through the mitigation of endogeneity in the regression model, the outcomes of the two-stage regression corroborate the primary regression results. An examination of heterogeneity unveils noteworthy disparities between urban and rural areas, as well as gender discrepancies, in how financial literacy influences household entrepreneurial behavior. Furthermore, this study validates three potential pathways-namely income, social network, and risk attitude channels-demonstrating that financial literacy significantly augments household income, expands social networks, and enhances risk attitudes. Moreover, through supplementary analysis, we ascertain that financial education amplifies the impact of financial literacy on entrepreneurial behavior. Our study contributes to the enrichment of human capital theory and modern entrepreneurship theory. It advocates for robust efforts by governments and financial institutions to widely disseminate financial knowledge and foster family entrepreneurship, thereby fostering the robust and stable operation of both the global financial market and the job market.

TI  - Board characteristics and sustainability reporting. A case of listed firms in East Africa
T2  - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUSINESS IN SOCIETY
AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate the influence of board characteristics on sustainability reporting among listed firms in East Africa. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a sample of 79 listed firms drawn from East African securities exchanges and data from 2011 to 2020. Sustainability reporting is measured using Global Reporting Initiative, and the data is analyzed by using three-panel data estimation models - fixed effect, random effect and the generalized method of moments. Findings The results reveal that board gender diversity, board financial expertise and board independence are positively and significantly associated with sustainability reporting. Conversely, board size has a negative and significant effect on sustainability reporting. Practical implications The findings from the study provide valuable insights to firm owners and policymakers. The study highlights the importance of directors with financial knowledge, a high proportion of non-executive directors and women representation in board and smaller boards as a strategy that will help firms improve sustainability practices and reporting in East Africa. Social implications Results of this study underscore the effect of corporate governance (CG) dimensions on social responsibility activities, such as philanthropy, emission reduction and waste management initiatives as reported through sustainability responsibility. Originality/value This study adds to the growing literature on the relationship between CG attributes and sustainability reporting from a developing economy perspective. Specifically, the study examines how board gender diversity, size, independence and financial expertise affect sustainability reporting adoption.

TI  - Relations between young adults' knowledge and understanding, experiences, and information behavior in personal finance matters
T2  - EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AB  - Background: In Germany, general secondary education offers few opportunities for young adults to acquire knowledge and understanding of personal finance. Hence, apart from parents' influence as role models, important influences on young adults' financial knowledge and understanding likely include their personal experience with financial products and their behavior of informally seeking information about specific financial products.
   Methods: In this paper, we investigate the relationships between these latter variables based on a sample of 1108 young adults from Germany, aged 17-25, beginning their studies in higher education. Knowledge and understanding of personal finance was assessed using the German adaptation of the US Test of Financial Literacy. In this paper, we focus on the dimension 'Banking' (covering financial investing, saving, using credit). In addition, we surveyed young adults'experience in basic personal finance matters (e.g., having a bank account, using a credit card, paying for rent) and their information behavior towards specific financial products (e.g., stocks, investment, retirement plans, and insurance).
   Results: The data set was prepared through multiple imputation and analyzed using regression models. The results show clear correlations between knowledge and understanding in the dimension 'Banking'and both experience and information behavior in personal finance matters.
   Conclusions: Our findings illustrate how important it is that young adults obtain experience with and actively inform themselves about financial products, particularly in countries such as Germany where personal finance is not taught extensively and systematically in school.

TI  - Teaching financial education in schools and students' financial literacy: A cross-country analysis withPISAdata
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS
AB  - In the last decade, developed and emerging economies have become increasingly aware of the importance of ensuring that their citizens are financially literate. Eighteen countries and economies, including 13 OECD countries, participated for the first time in 2012 on the financial literacy assessment of 15-year-old students. Financial literacy scores varied according to the participating countries, and they were determined by factors related to the teaching-learning process, especially those related to the delivery of financial education in schools. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the provision of financial education in the school curriculum across all the countries that participated in PISA 2012-data from 2015 did not allow such analysis. We measured the direct effect of different ways of financial education delivery on students' financial literacy scores, after controlling for math and reading performance, and individual characteristics of students and their schools. The majority of the countries have introduced financial education topics in the curriculum somehow. But only in the Flemish Community of Belgium, the United States, and Latvia-and to a lesser extent in Australia, Estonia, France, Israel, Poland, Spain, the Czech Republic, the Russian Federation, and the Slovak Republic-the way how financial education (FE) is delivered is positively correlated with students' financial literacy scores: FE taught as part of business or economics courses in Belgium, FE taught as part of a cross-curricular subject in the U.S., and FE taught as part of mathematics in Latvia. Our main findings pose fundamental challenges for educational policy regarding school-based FE. The first is to decide at what age (grade) interventions should be introduced into the education system so that students are not only financially literate but also financially competent. The second is to devise instructional approaches that more effectively lead young people to put pertinent financial knowledge into practice and to do so correctly when they make financial decisions.

TI  - Investors in the Bangladeshi stock market: issues, behavioural biases and circumvention strategies
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to explore the underlying issues of behavioural biases in relation to stock market participation and the challenges of individual investors in Bangladesh. The study identifies behavioural biases affecting individuals' stock market participation, their circumvention strategies and the importance of financial knowledge in encouraging the participation of individuals in the stock market.Design/methodology/approachSemi-structured interviews were used in this study to gather information from industry researchers, individual investors, brokers and institutional advisors. Twenty-two experts were contacted, and 13 agreed to participate in the interviews. The study then uses the thematic analysis method to report its findings.FindingsThis research shows that investors' behavioural biases (such as loss aversion, herding, trust, gambler's fallacy and risk tolerance) are among Bangladesh's primary drivers of stock market participation. Circumvention strategies (such as poor corporate governance and agency costs) also play a part in individuals' participation. These influences are in addition to the obvious factors of investment risks, poor infrastructure, poor regulation enforcement and the need for more sufficient investment products.Research limitations/implicationsThis study conducted 13 interviews with expert subjects, which is a small sample size. However, the findings achieved saturation and cannot be ignored. Future research should use quantitative or experimental methods with a large sample size to validate the current findings.Originality/valueThis study is pioneering in the Bangladesh stock market, exploring the behavioural biases of investors' participation in the market. This paper provides valuable insights into investor participation by discovering the underlying behavioural biases that have been continually ignored; these insights may also be relevant in frontier markets in Asian countries.

TI  - The sustainable development of university student loans based on the evolutionary game
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Purpose
   National student loans help solve the problem of tuition fees for students from poor families to a great extent. This paper aims to study the behavior of three main players involved in university student loans, namely, universities, banks and students and explores necessary conditions for promoting the steady development of student loans, as well as the sustainability of cooperation and coordination among players, thus promoting the further development of student loans.
   Design/methodology/approach
   First, from the perspectives of the three related players of banks, students and universities and their behavior, this paper establishes a three-player behavioral evolutionary game model, conducts a sustainable game analysis among the different players, and by replicating the dynamic equations with the Jacobian matrix solve the evolutionarily stable strategy. Finally, applying MATLAB tools, a sensitivity analysis of relevant impacting factors is carried out to explore the influencing mechanism of the sustainable development of student loans.
   Findings
   To achieve the mechanism of mutual coordination and cooperation between participants, banks need to be guided to actively issue student loans and conduct strict loan review. College students should be encouraged to establish good credit and strengthen penalties should be implemented for violations of regulations. Universities should be encouraged to help banks reduce information asymmetry, promote financial knowledge and student integrity education and promote the sustainable development of national student loans.
   Originality/value
   This research will help scholars better understand the interaction mechanism among universities, banks and students, and promote the sustainable development of national student loans.

TI  - Between Income, Savings and Investment, How Do College Students Perceive Money Management?
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
AB  - The aim of the study is to evaluate the factorial solution that explains financial knowledge in the topics of income, savings, investment and how students perceive money management. For this purpose, the EFA and the SEM methodology are used. To obtain the information, a non-probabilistic sampling by self-determination was carried out, applying the instrument in electronic format and for the analysis; the EFA and SEM methodology was used. At the end of the estimated time for data collection, 596 participating students were achieved. The items of the variables income, savings, investment and money management from the scale used in Contreras (2016), were used. The main finding is the structure obtained from the confirmatory analysis, which presents acceptable indices of absolute goodness of fit, structural adjustment, and parsimony that allows us to understand how the student perceives income, savings, investment, and money management. The values obtained are acceptable based on the suggested theoretical criteria (RMSEA = 0,054; CMIN/DF = 2,749; GFI (,951), AGFI = ,926; PGFI = ,634; TLI = ,906; CFI = ,929; and parsimony: PRATIO = ,762; PNFI = ,681; PCFI = ,707). The result has practical implications for educational institutions, considering that in the academic training of students it is essential to encourage habits related to money. Considering that, economic income is a resource that they will have in their future when they work, then it is related to the habit of saving and investing, to this, we add the good and proper management of their personal finances, and finally, the cycle of promotion to savings.

TI  - Digital financial literacy and usage of cashless payments in Jordan: the moderating role of gender
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to examine the relationships between various components of digital financial literacy, namely, awareness, subjective knowledge, experience, the digital legal framework and skills, and their influence on the adoption of cashless payment systems among university affiliates in Jordan. It also explores the mediating role of gender in this relationship. The study integrates the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and social role theory (SRT).Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a cross-sectional survey across 34 Jordanian universities. Data from 418 participants were analyzed, focusing on factor analysis to assess the constructs' reliability and validity and to explore the moderating effects.FindingsThe findings illuminate that digital financial awareness, experience and skills are significant catalysts for using cashless payments among the targeted demographic. In contrast, the digital legal framework and subjective financial knowledge did not significantly influence cashless payment use. Additionally, gender differences emerged, highlighting a stronger association between digital financial experience and cashless payment usage for women.Originality/valueThe study's uniqueness stems from its detailed analysis of digital financial literacy's effect on cashless payment adoption in Jordan's academia, incorporating aspects like legal frameworks, awareness, and skills. It innovatively considers gender's moderating role, adding fresh insights into digital finance practices. Using the TPB and SRT, the research connects theory with Jordan's empirical data, suggesting strategies for education and policy. This work advances understanding of digital financial literacy in fostering a more inclusive digital financial system, contributing significantly to digital finance and behavioral economics literature.

TI  - Research on the Effect of the Rural Wealth-Leader on Poverty Reduction of Farmers-Based on the Questionnaire Survey in China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The rural wealth-leader is one of the 10 projects of targeted poverty alleviation in the period of poverty alleviation. As the "leading wild goose" in rural areas, the personal characteristics of the rural wealth-leader directly affect the effect of stabilizing poverty and increasing income of poor farmers. Based on the survey of the rural wealth-leader in 10 cities and 21 counties, this paper systematically analyzes the path of poverty reduction by the rural wealth-leader, combs out the key individual characteristics that affect farmers' poverty reduction, and puts forward a research hypothesis. Through empirical analysis, the research hypothesis is tested and the influencing mechanism is analyzed. The model results show that: The rural wealth-leader has a significant effect on increasing farmers' income and eliminating poverty. The rural wealth-leader with high education level and engaged in e-commerce has a significant effect on increasing farmers' income. Party members and the skilled rural wealth-leaders have a significant impact on rural households' poverty alleviation. The income increasing effect of culture and education is negatively affected by corporate loans, and the income increasing effect of e-commerce is negatively affected by corporate profits. Therefore, we should improve the profit distribution mode of e-commerce related enterprises to avoid farmers being marginalized in the process of e-commerce development. The skills, management and financial knowledge training of the rural wealth-leaders should be strengthened to improve their knowledge and skills. Meanwhile, supporting fiscal, financial and tax policies should be improved.

TI  - Is It Necessary to Launch a School-Based Financial Literacy Curriculum? Evidence From China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - As starting university is a critical independence milestone for many young people, it would also be the best time to provide them with some financial education (FE). Although there have been many initiatives aimed at enhancing individual financial literacy (FL) and/or financial decision-making, meta-analyses have shown that the effectiveness of FE has been mixed. This study examined the driving forces behind the decision by college students to enroll in a targeted financial literacy curriculum (FLC) and the impact of this attendance on their FL. An endogenous switching model (ESM) was employed to account for the heterogeneity in the decision to attend or not attend the FLC and to counteract any unobservable characteristics. It was found that students with higher self-perceived FL did not prefer to attend the FLC; however, for others, FLC attendance was found to significantly boost their FL in areas such as financial knowledge (FK), financial attitude (FA), and financial behavior (FB), especially for the non-attendees under the counterfactual framework. These "non-attendees" were observed to have some characteristics (e.g., prior knowledge) that made them more financially literate regardless of attendance; however, if they had attended the FLC, they would have gained a greater FL than the attendees. As the FL of the attendees would have been much lower if they had not attended, the FLC appeared to be particularly important for the attendees, which strengthened the case for making the FLC a compulsory part of a general college education.

TI  - Does Digital Inclusive Finance Mitigate the Negative Effect of Climate Variation on Rural Residents' Income Growth in China?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have exacerbated climate variation. Climate variation impacts the agricultural production and rural residents' income negatively, further widening the urban-rural income gap and harming the co-benefits. Narrowing the income gap has always been a global concern and an important part of China's rural revitalization strategy. However, little is known about whether digital inclusive finance can mitigate the negative impact of climate variation on rural residents' income growth in China. Using panel data from 31 provinces in China from 2011 to 2019 and a digital inclusive finance index developed by Peking University, together with historical temperature data, this study examined the impact of digital inclusive finance on Chinese rural residents' income growth in response to climate variation. It was found that digital inclusive finance could promote rural resident operating, wage, and transfer income growth. A heterogeneity analysis revealed that rural residents in central and western regions experienced larger digital inclusive finance facilitating effects on income growth than the eastern regions. Further analyses using the Spatial Dubin Model found that digital inclusive finance had a spatial spillover effect as it could significantly promote income growth in neighboring provinces. Although climate variation reduced rural residents' income and increased their risks, digital inclusive finance significantly mitigated this negative effect. Digital information infrastructure construction, financial risk prevention, digital financial knowledge, and e-commerce popularization were practical paths to optimizing inclusive finance development in rural areas and promoting poverty alleviation and rural revitalization to resist climate risks.

TI  - Spenders and Savers, Tightwads and Spendthrifts: Individual Correlates of Personal Ratings of Being a Spender or a Saver
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE PSYCHOLOGY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - There is limited literature on the causes, correlates, and consequences of being a saver (tightwad) or a spender (spendthrift). This paper reports on five studies which look at demographic, bright- and dark-side personality, money belief, and self-evaluation correlates of to what extent a person considers themselves a spender or saver. In each study, adult participants indicated their spender-saver habits on a single scale and completed a number of tests. The first study looked at trait correlates and showed savers were close-minded, conscientious, stable, extraverts. It also showed as predicted that savers were more likely to associate money with security, and not love or freedom, and claim to have better financial knowledge. The results from the second study on dark-side personality correlates indicated that spenders were more likely to have psychopathic tendencies, but less likely to be Machiavellian. The third study on personality disorder correlates of spender-saver tendencies suggested that spenders were likely to have elevated Cluster B personality disorders. The fourth study examined self-beliefs and showed savers rated themselves as more attractive, healthy, and intelligent than spenders. The fifth study, also using various self-ratings, showed spenders had more liberal political views, report higher emotional intelligence and are less likely to own their own home, while savers rated their physical health higher, and saw themselves as more entrepreneurial. Overall, the results suggest the simple saver-spender question is logically correlated with a number of individual difference variables with savers having a more positive profile. Implications and limitations are considered.

TI  - An interactive qualitative analysis of academics' views of a competency-based undergraduate qualification in risk management
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this research was first to determine the competencies mandatory of risk managers, and second, to consider the implications of such competencies in determining modules appropriate for inclusion in any prospective undergraduate qualification with specialisation in risk management. Design/methodology/approachA qualitative research approach was followed, involving academics teaching risk management in a focus group and making use of interactive qualitative analysis (IQA). FindingsThe competencies identified were business management skills, financial knowledge, an understanding of the risk management process, governance and compliance, people management and technical skills. These will be explained in greater detail in the paper. Research limitations/implicationsThe implications for teaching are that an undergraduate curriculum in risk management will have to combine majors such as business management, financial management, risk management, industrial psychology and communication. These majors need to be complemented by modules in governance and compliance management, as well as information and communication technology. Practical implicationsThe implication for practice is that risk management professionals and members of the Institute of Risk Management of South Africa need to avail themselves to serve on an advisory board of academic departments offering risk management qualifications. Risk management is a developing science and requires inputs about research and the curriculation of qualifications. Social implicationsThe implication for public policy is that the South African Qualifications Authority and the Council for Higher Education should reconsider their requirements for designators (specialised qualifications). The implications for research are that IQA provides clarity on the knowledge and skills required to develop a competency-based qualification in risk management. Further research should benchmark qualifications and propose a curriculum for a bachelor's degree in risk management. Originality/valueThe use of IQA is a novel way of ensuring rigour and objectivity in arriving at a description of the required knowledge, skills, values and attributes of risk managers. This paper will assist in the compilation of a new curriculum for an undergraduate qualification in risk management; thus, ensuring such qualification will provide a competency-based qualification that will meet the needs of the profession.

TI  - The nexus between investor sophistication and annuity insurance ownership: evidence from FINRA's National Financial Capability Study
T2  - MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB  - Purpose Although annuitization provides insurance against longevity risk that can benefit households, researchers have uncovered an annuitization puzzle, which suggests households are reluctant to annuitize their wealth. This study contributes to the discussions on the annuitization puzzle by examining investor sophistication and owning annuities in non-retirement accounts. Design/methodology/approach The study utilizes data from the 2018 U S National Financial Capability Study (NFCS). The empirical analyses are based on logistic regression estimates of annuity ownership on investor sophistication. Interpretations are based on odds ratios. Findings The findings indicate that investor sophistication contributes to the annuity puzzle. Investors with low objective and high subjective investment knowledge (overconfident investors) are more likely to own annuities compared to those with low objective and low subjective investment knowledge. However, investors with high objective and low subjective investment knowledge (under-confident investors) are less likely to choose annuity ownership compared to those with low objective and low subjective investment knowledge. The findings and ensuing discussion highlight the importance of annuitization when planning for retirement, with implications for financial service professionals. Research limitations/implications The measure of investor sophistication does not assess the difficulty level of each financial knowledge question. The questions used to construct the investor sophistication variable are based on general investment knowledge. In addition, the annuity ownership variable used in this study pertains to investments outside retirement accounts. Despite these limitations, the findings highlight the importance of annuitization when planning for retirement. Originality/value Unlike prior studies, the authors consider four mutually exclusive measures of investor sophistication constructed from measures of objective and subjective investment knowledge to understand the effect of investor sophistication on annuity ownership in the United States.

TI  - The Behavioral Role of Digital Economy Adaptation in Sustainable Financial Literacy and Financial Inclusion
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The basic aim of this research was to investigate the impact of the behavioral biases on financial inclusion in Pakistan while considering the moderating effect of financial literacy in this relation, in the context of behavioral perspective. This study focused on the significant behavioral phenomenon, including self-control, optimism, herding, and loss aversion with a perspective of the digital economy. To test the proposed hypothesis, the primary data collection method was used. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect data from 102 individual households through the convenience sampling technique. SmartPLS was used to analyze collected data. This study found the negative impact of self-control, optimism, and herding on financial inclusion. In contrast, loss aversion contributes to the uplift of financial inclusion in Pakistan. Similarly, financial literacy proved to have a decreasing effect on financial inclusion because of religious concerns. The moderation effect of financial literacy was also significantly positive except for loss aversion. The behavioral phenomenon proved to have a significant impact on financial inclusion. This research shows that individual households who do not use developed technological services and products from formal financial inclusion can overcome the behavioral biases that hinder them from making informed financial decisions. This research work will significantly help households use financial services to improve their standard of living and overall long-term financial well-being. This research is essential because many households are not using bank services and have low financial knowledge in Pakistan. The key contribution of this research study is that it found the relation between behavioral factors and financial inclusion. Financial literacy also has a moderating effect on their relations.

TI  - Financial Literacy in Plastic Surgery Training: Importance and Current Status
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
AB  - Background:Medical training is known to impose financial burden on trainees, which has been shown to contribute to burnout, even possibly compromising patient care. Financial literacy allows for management of financial situations affecting professional and personal life. The authors aimed to evaluate the financial status and knowledge among plastic surgery residents.Methods:A survey regarding finances and financial literacy of plastic surgery residents was sent to all the current accredited U.S. residency programs. The same survey was distributed internally. A descriptive analysis was performed, and multiple Fisher exact tests and a t test evaluated comparisons.Results:Eighty-six residents were included. Most trainees had a student loan (59.3%), with 22.1% having loans more than $300,000. A majority had at least one personal loan debt other than educational (51.1%). Residents with more debt were significantly less likely to pay off their balances monthly. A total of 17.4% of trainees had no plan for how to invest their retirement savings, whereas 55.8% reported not knowing how much they need to save to retire. One in five trainees did not feel prepared to manage personal finances/retirement planning after graduation, a majority had no formal personal finance education in their curriculum, and 89.5% agreed that financial literacy education would be beneficial. Our institutional data largely mirrored national data.Conclusions:Many residents are lacking in financial knowledge, despite most having significant debt. Additional financial literacy education is needed in plastic surgery training. Curricula development at an institutional or national society level are possible paths toward a coordinated response to this need.

TI  - Cognitive abilities and financial resilience: evidence from an emerging market
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - PurposeThe current study is to examine the association between cognitive abilities and financial resilience among millennial single parents. This study examines the role of cognitive abilities on financial resilience after controlling for key demographic variables - gender, age, university degree, employment status and staying with parents.Design/methodology/approachUsing the ordered logit regression approach, the authors analyzed results for 395 single parents (237 single mothers and 159 single fathers) aged 31 to 40 in India. Financial resilience is measured using economic resources, financial resources, financial knowledge and behavior, and social capital. The authors further provide several robustness tests to validate their findings. The results are controlled for state-fixed effects.FindingsThe authors find a significant impact of single parents' cognitive abilities on their financial resilience. This study also found that gender, age, university degree, employment status and staying with parents influence single parents' financial resilience. Single mothers are found to have higher levels of both cognitive abilities and financial resilience scores than single fathers.Practical implicationsFinancial institutions, marketers and financial advisors can find innovative ways to increase the financial resilience of single parents by improving their cognitive ability. Also, policymakers should focus on interventions to increase single parents' education level to increase their financial resilience and provide policy support to those without any parental support system.Originality/valueThis study extends the literature on financial resilience in two directions - by establishing a relationship between cognitive abilities and financial resilience and studying the financial resilience of a vulnerable societal section-millennial single parents. The study also extends the literature on single parents' financial vulnerability by establishing a relationship between key demographic variables and their financial resilience.

TI  - Impact of religiosity and branding on SMEs performance: does financial literacy play a role?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING
AB  - Purpose This study aims to examine the relationship between religiosity and branding on small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs') performance in Saudi Arabia. It also examines the mediating role of financial literacy on the relationship among Islamic religiosity, branding and SMEs' performance.
   Design/methodology/approach This study adopts the purposive sampling technique in three major commercial cities, namely, Riyadh, Jeddah and Al-Qassim to sample 100 SMEs each, resulting in a total sampling of 300 SMEs in Saudi Arabia. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze the hypotheses formulated in this study. The structural equation modeling is aided with the help of Smart-PLS software.
   Findings This study finds that Islamic branding (on customer, compliance and origin) significantly affect financial attitude, while Islamic religiosity affects financial awareness among the SMEs. Findings reveal that there is a mediating role of financial awareness on the relationship between Islamic branding and Islamic religiosity with the SMEs' performance. No mediation effect was recorded for financial attitude and financial knowledge. Further investigation reveals that financial attitude, financial awareness, Islamic branding (compliance and origin) and Islamic religiosity were the most significant determinants of SMEs' performance in the context of Saudi Arabia.
   Research limitations/implications This study is conducted on SMEs in Saudi Arabia only. Further studies are required to examine SMEs in other Islamic countries and regions to improve the explanatory power of financial literacy on Islamic religiosity and Islamic branding for improved SMEs performance.
   Originality/value This study establishes that Islamic religiosity and branding could further increase the predictive power of financial literacy on SMEs' performance. This study concludes that efforts to improve financial literacy should be religion-based as well as culture-based depending on where the SMEs are located so that specific strategies can be implemented, to enable the conducive growth of the SMEs and maximize the contribution of the SMEs to economic growth.

TI  - Exploring the first steps of retirement engagement: a conceptual model and field evidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF SERVICE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The authors develop and validate a conceptual model, the retirement engagement model (REM), to understand the relationships between behavioral engagement (retirement information search), cognitive factors and engagement (e.g. beliefs and financial knowledge), emotional engagement (e.g. anxiety), and socio-demographic factors. Approach: The authors derive the REM through a three-step procedure: (1) an extensive literature review, (2) interactive feedback sessions with experts to confirm the model's academic and managerial relevance, and (3) an empirical test of the REM with field data (N = 583). The authors use a partial least squares (PLS) structural equation model and examine heterogeneity through a finite mixture model. Design/methodology/approach Around the globe, people are insufficiently engaged with retirement planning. The customer engagement literature offers rich insights into antecedents, outcomes, and barriers to engagement. However, customer engagement literature lacks insights into cognitive, emotional and behavioral factors that drive engagement in retirement planning, a utilitarian service context, which is important for financial well-being. Findings Beliefs such as perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy, together with trust and retirement anxiety, explain people's search for pension information. These factors can be used to define three clear, actionable segments of consumers. Originality/value The findings advance the customer engagement and transformative service research literature by generating insights on engagement with retirement planning, a utilitarian rather than hedonic service context that is especially relevant for financial well-being. The findings inform managerial practice and emphasize the relevance of including cognitive and emotional engagement factors that trigger behavioral engagement. The REM can help to improve pension communication. For example, the results indicate that marketers should stress the benefits of, rather than the barriers to, acquiring information.

TI  - Clinically Competent and Fiscally at Risk: Impact of Debt and Financial Parameters on the Surgical Resident
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the costs of medical training continue to increase, surgeon income and personal financial decisions may be challenged to manage this expanding debt burden. We sought to characterize the financial liability, assets, income, and debt of surgical residents, and evaluate the necessity for additional financial training.
   STUDY DESIGN: All surgical trainees at a single academic center completed a detailed survey. Questions focused on issues related to debt, equity, cash flow, financial education, and fiscal parameters. Responses were used to calculate debt-to-asset and debt-to-income ratios. Predictors of moderate risk debt-to-asset ratio (0.5 to 0.9), high risk debt-to-asset ratio (>= 0.9), and high risk debt-to-income ratio (>0.4) were evaluated. All analyses were performed in SPSS v.21.
   RESULTS: One hundred five trainees completed the survey (80% response rate), with 38% of respondents reporting greater than $200,000 in educational debt. Overall, 82% of respondents had a moderate or high risk debt-to-asset ratio. Residency program, year, sex, and perception of financial knowledge did not correlate with high risk debt-to-asset ratio. Residents with high debt-to-asset ratios were more likely to have a high level of concern about debt (52% vs 0%, p < 0.001) when compared with residents who had low debt-to-asset ratios. The majority (79%) of respondents felt strongly that inclusion of additional financial training in residency education is a critical need.
   CONCLUSIONS: In a climate of increasingly delayed financial gratification, surgical trainees are on critically unstable financial footing. There is a major gap in current surgical education that requires reassessment for the long-term financial health of residents. (C) 2018 by the American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - HOW FEMALE DIFFER IN DECISION MAKING FOR PERSONAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - This study investigates Lithuanian females' personal investment peculiarities in line with Australia's case analysis and application as a good practice method. Based on many publicly available research females tend to have less knowledge about finances in general and particularly investment processes; hence, it leads to their lack of interest into investing and the possibility of poor money management. This issue might be solved by investigating why it appears first and adopting the practical example from countries with developed investment market. In the case of comparison of personal investment strategies among Lithuanian and Australian females the two sets of questionnaires have been used to collect the data for further analysis. The main findings revealed by the survey were, that women in Australia had a higher financial literacy level, invested more often, and chose broader variety of investment instruments compared to Lithuanian females. Moreover, the significant discovery of the article disclosed that Lithuanian females chose not to invest due to the lack of additional funds and the shortage of financial knowledge. The main limitation occurred during the research was the lack of the available data on personal investment topic in Lithuania's official statistic sources such as The Lithuanian Department of Statistics. The results of the research contribute towards improving Lithuanian female personal finance and investment areas and could be applied to further studies or used for the education program dedicated to financial literacy among women in Lithuania creation. Furthermore, this article creates an original value to personal finance, investment, and financial literacy areas in Lithuania by introducing an idea to not only conduct more studies in these fields, but also to use comparative analysis and good practice method from the countries that demonstrates high achievements in personal finance and gender equality areas.

TI  - Determinants of defaults on P2P lending platforms in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB  - Chinese P2P lending platforms have an astonishing default rate of 87.2% based on data available in 2019, which indicates the seriousness of the problem this industry faces. Insufficient regulation has resulted in generation of risky services, such as margin finance in 2015 for stock markets and zero down-payment mortgages in 2016 for real estate buyers. Such services are prone to resulting in dramatic losses to investors with the following potential causes: adverse selection caused by information asymmetry of the P2P platform operators, lack of financial knowledge or expertise of the investors, insufficient regulation on P2P platforms, and changes in policies related to stock and real estate markets.
   Does "Too Big to Fail" (TBTF) apply to Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms in China? Are platforms with large Transaction Volumes or large Total Loan Size safer? This paper aims at answering such questions and identifies other factors that have led to defaults of such P2P lending platforms. In order to generate a more robust model that covers a wider range of factors, we adopt two approaches: Failure Prediction Model and Decomposition Methods. The reason why we have adopted this approach was that the factors that caused failure of such P2P platforms were very complicated and varied in nature. Failure Prediction Model is mainly based on the disclosed transaction or financial data. However, Decomposition Method aims at identification of sources of problem from different groups of factors, such as internal operations and external business environment. Also, another contribution of our research is that the data sets that we have used are from three different sources, which provide us a more comprehensive picture about the risks faced by such P2P lending firms.
   This study provides evidence that the bond yield, which reflects the liquidity level of the market, is the major reason for P2P platforms' failure during the research period. Our results also indicate that apart from the size-related factors one also needs to answer the question "Were platforms with larger Transaction Volumes and Total Loan Sizes safer?" The style factors like the interest rate and ownership, the timing factors like loan maturity and bond yield, and the selectivity factors like popularity are found to be even more significant. Hopefully, our findings could contribute academically to the existing literature in the credit risk estimation of online P2P lending platforms and provide practical support for development of a more effective risk monitoring system for online P2P lending platforms.

TI  - Developing financial competence about mortgage loans by informal learning using banks' online calculators
T2  - EMPIRICAL RESEARCH IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AB  - Background and aim: Financial literacy (or financial competence) has become an internationally relevant and highly regarded topic. Since people often lack sufficient financial competence, in many countries efforts have been made to foster formal financial education. Less attention, however, has been paid to whether informal learning using information available on the Internet can also support the development of financial competence. However, this seems to be an important question because the Internet has expanded the opportunities for informal learning. In addition, people need to acquire financial competence on their own because not every financial topic relevant in one's lifetime is covered in formal education syllabi. Against this background, in this study we tested whether people are able to develop financial competence by learning informally using information available on the Internet. We focused on mortgage loans, as they are comparatively complex financial products. Mortgage loans have the potential to significantly influence an individual's financial situation. In addition, society might carry the burdens of risky and uninformed decisions about mortgage loans-as the financial and real estate crisis has shown.
   Method: 45 students of economics and business studies in their final undergraduate year participated. They were randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental group explored information about mortgage loans using the loan calculator of a German bank. The control group did not explore webpages. Before the intervention, students from both groups completed knowledge tests and self-assessed their financial knowledge and behaviour. After the intervention, students had to work on a case and to decide whether a small family should take out a mortgage loan for financing a house. The decision had to be justified. In addition, students were administered an immediate and delayed knowledge test.
   Results and conclusions: Students of both groups did not differ in knowledge acquisition, decision making about taking a mortgage loan and argumentation quality. However, prior knowledge can be referred to in order to explain the results. Therefore, informal learning using the Internet did not seem to be effective if people did not have sufficient prior knowledge. This result underlines, on the one hand, the necessity of financial education-be it prior to informal learning or in the course of informal learning. On the other hand, the results can be interpreted as a hint to consider how to improve informal learning activities, e.g. by supporting self-regulation or by improving information material.

TI  - Analyzing the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion by microfinance banks in developing countries: social network theoretical approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY
AB  - Purpose The main purpose of this study is to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach The study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected from the poor who resides in rural Uganda. Structural equation modelling (SEM) through analysis of moment structures (AMOS) was used to analyze the data. Bootstrap approach with 5,000 samples was run to establish the mediating effect of social network in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Findings The results showed that social network significantly and positively mediate the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. In addition, financial literacy also has a direct significant and positive effect on financial inclusion. Overall, the findings suggest that the presence of social network fully mediate the effect of financial literacy on financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Research limitations/implications This study adopted a cross-sectional research design and data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Future studies could adopt longitudinal research design to establish the dynamic characteristics of the samples under study over time. Besides, this study collected data from only poor households who were clients of microfinance banks located in rural Uganda. It ignored the other section of the population who were not the poor. Therefore, future studies could use the other section of the population who are clients of commercial banks. Practical implications The advocates of financial literacy and managers of microfinance banks in developing countries should ensure using existing local structures such as community and village associations to conduct financial literacy training. The village associations help in mobilizing members who are close-knit based on the existing societal ties that can be used as a channel for disseminating vital financial literacy information. Indeed, financial literacy workshops, seminars, and business clinics can be easily conducted to individuals who are members of the village associations. Originality/value This paper integrates social network theory in the relationship between financial literacy and financial inclusion of the poor by microfinance banks in developing countries. Social network acts as a conduit through which financial knowledge and skills flow to increase the scope of financial inclusion of the poor in developing countries.

TI  - FINANCIAL LITERACY AS THE BASIS OF THE CULTURE OF UKRAINE'S POPULATION
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - It has been noted that the modern development of the financial sphere of Ukraine is one of the priorities of the state administration agencies. Economic awareness of the population leads to a decrease in unemployment, stability of the national currency and the formation of a new economic culture of the population, which requires, above all, an adequate level of the financial literacy.
   It has been concluded that the functioning of all spheres of society is not possible without the use of the financial information, application of financial knowledge. Financial awareness helps to understand key financial concepts and use them to make decisions about income, expenses and savings, to choose the proper financial instruments, to plan the budget, to accumulate funds for future goals.
   Existing scientific approaches have been studied and the authors have offered own definition of the concept of "financial literacy", which means awareness, knowledge, skills, attitudes ( life guides) and behavior, which allow to make sound financial decisions for achieving personal financial well-being, as well as financial activity of every citizen of the state to ensure social stability in society.
   The authors have distinguished a number of factors that affect the financial literacy of the population and they include: ignorance in the financial sphere; ignorance of how financial institutions of the state operate and their advantages; distrust to financial institutions and financial organizations; inability to distribute income and expenses; fear of starting own business.
   It has been noted that increasing the level of the financial literacy of Ukrainian citizens will enhance their ability to exercise effective financial control over the use of their own financial resources and to make sound financial decisions, and in our opinion, would become an integral element of the financial culture of society.
   It has been substantiated that there is no agency in Ukraine responsible for the implementation of the state policy in the field of the financial literacy of the population, which would develop, implement the National Program for raising the level of financial literacy of the population, and would also monitor the situation on this issue in Ukraine. Perspective research areas are the study of the effectiveness of teaching the discipline "Financial Literacy" in general secondary schools.

TI  - Financial literacy and its determinants: the case of rural farm households in Ghana
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine the determinants of rural dwellers financial literacy in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional primary data set was used to estimate the factors influencing rural farm households' financial literacy using the IV-Tobit model. Findings The findings reveal that most rural residents are financially illiterate. The econometrics model results depicted that respondents' socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as gender, income, age and education significantly affect financial literacy. Again, respondents who are risk seekers and listen or watch education programs are more likely to be financially literate. Research limitations/implications The paper examined the determinants of rural dwellers financial literacy in four regions in Ghana. Future research should consider all or many regions for an informed generalization of findings. Practical implications This paper provides evidence that rural dwellers are financially illiterate and it would require the policymakers or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to establish a village or community group that comprises a wide range of bankers and government officials to help rural dwellers acquire some financial skills. Also, the positive relationship between media (whether respondent watches or listens to educational programs) and financial literacy implies that policymakers should focus on improving individuals' financial knowledge through training programs and utilize the media as a channel to propagate financial education to the public. Originality/value Although previous studies have examined the determinants of financial literacy, little is known in developing countries and, in particular, rural communities. The authors fill this gap by contributing to the scanty existing literature in developing countries in several ways. First, this is the first study to examine the financial literacy level of rural dwellers in Ghana. Second, to not undermine the credibility of the estimation results, this study addresses the potential endogeneity issue, which other researchers have not adequately recognized. Finally, the study expands the scant literature on the subject and provides critical policy implications that will help policymakers formulate financial market policies that will contribute to rural dwellers financial literacy enhancement.

TI  - Factors determining upland farmers' participation in non-timber forest product value chains for sustainable poverty reduction in Vietnam
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
AB  - The development of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) plays an active role in overall economic development and is considered a new direction for sustainable forestry development to help people escape poverty. From micro data collected by a survey of poor, rural households living in the mountainous region of Central Vietnam, a structural equation model (SEM) incorporating the six factors of household head characteristics, household characteristics, reputation statuses of households, forest characteristics, willingness to participate in NTFP value chains, and financial effects of NTFP value chains was established. An empirical study of the effects of farmers' behaviors on NTFP financial value chains was also conducted. The results showed that household head characteristics, household characteristics, reputation statuses of households, and forest characteristics were positively correlated with people's willingness to participate in NTFP value chains and increase the financial efficiency of the value chains. However, each factor has a different level of influence. Additional empirical factors affecting farmers' awareness of poverty reduction policies were investigated. It was found that the more farmers understand sustainable poverty reduction policies, the more willing they are to participate in the value chains. The willingness to participate in the value chains strongly affects the financial performances of the value chains. Farmers are expected to be willing to fulfill their obligations and their enthusiasm for participating in the value chains has increased the financial efficiency of the value chains. In the future, the government can cooperate with official financial institutions, policy finance institutions, and local rural intermediaries to increase public financial knowledge, poverty reduction policies and projects in poor areas, and the participation of poor farmers, as well as solve their credit problems. Meanwhile, in developing a financial model of new NTFP value chains, more attention should be paid to the needs of farmers and this model should be built with the aim of the sustainable development of NTFP value chains.

TI  - Personal finance blogs: Helpful tool for consumers with low financial literacy or preaching to the choir?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - Recent transitions from defined benefit to defined contribution plans assign greater individual responsibility to consumers to prepare for retirement and make consequential financial choices. However, many consumers are ill-equipped to do so, considering overall low levels of financial literacy. At the same time, there is increasing controversy about the effectiveness of traditional financial education, such as high school financial education, counselling and seminars or workshops. Alternative sources of (just-in-time) financial training or advice may be needed to financially empower consumers and help them make important financial decisions. In the light of these developments, this study investigates if consumers perceive personal finance blogs as a helpful alternative in acquiring financial knowledge, and which factors influence perceived helpfulness of and intention to use personal finance blogs. Using Structural Equation Modelling to analyse data from a sample of U.S. consumers, the results of this study uncover that financial literacy and susceptibility to informational influence have a significant positive association with perceived helpfulness. Perceived financial uncertainty, which refers to uncertainty in terms of consumers' perceived ability to accurately predict their future financial needs, has a significant negative association with perceived helpfulness of and intention to use personal finance blogs. Finally, perceived helpfulness of a personal finance blog is a significant positive predictor of consumers' intention to use it. Overall, the findings suggest that personal finance blogs are preaching to the choir, since the consumers who are most likely to use personal finance blogs seem to need them the least given their higher levels of financial literacy and lower levels of perceived financial uncertainty. Taken together, the findings shed light on the potential users of personal finance blogs and underline the challenges of a one-size-fits-all' financial education. This study aids in assessing personal finance blogs as an online resource which is scarcely researched, but which has the potential to provide just-in-time financial education to consumers across the world.

TI  - What restricts SMEs from adopting sophisticated capital budgeting practices?
T2  - SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB  - Plain English Summary Capital budgeting is a financial management instrument that evaluates potential investment alternatives and decides which investment project will benefit the firm most. It deals with large long-term funds and their allocations. Despite its prominence, studies report that small and medium enterprises do not practice capital budgeting. This study explores the barriers faced by small and medium enterprises towards the use of capital budgeting while making their long-term investment decisions. The study finds that the lack of financial knowledge and training of the decision-maker and the complexity, calculation difficulty, and time associated with the capital budgeting techniques are the biggest impediments to the practice of capital budgeting among small firms.
   The lack of robust financial management is an integral growth constraint faced by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). For the sustainability and growth of SMEs, it is vital to choose the correct long-term projects. Yet, literature shows that SMEs across the globe hardly practice the sophisticated capital budgeting (CB) method. The present study identifies, prioritizes, and proposes a structural model of the barriers to CB practices. The study adopts an integrated method combining the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (F-AHP) and the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL) approach to evaluate the barriers to CB practices among SMEs in India. The prioritization obtained through the F-AHP suggests that the knowledge barrier of the decision-makers and the inherent barrier associated with the CB techniques are the most weighted main barriers impeding the practice of CB among SMEs. Also, the most important sub-barriers are time consumption and high complexity of the methods, lack of financial education and training of decision-makers, and lack of computation technology. F-DEMATEL provides a reliable quantitative measure of the association of the barriers to implementing sophisticated CB practices among SMEs. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to identify, prioritize, and structure the barriers to CB practices. Also, it is the first to apply multi-criteria decision-making tools in this field of research. Our findings can help financial managers/practitioners of SMEs to formulate sophisticated CB techniques in their investment decision strategies and efficiently manage their long-term funds.

TI  - Revisiting the concept of Islamic financial literacy in a boundaryless context: cross-country comparison of Islamic financial literacy
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC ACCOUNTING AND BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeThere is a growing body of literature that recognizes the importance of Islamic financial literacy (IFL) while it is at the heart of our understanding of the overall financial system. To date, insufficient attention has been paid to Turkey, the Balkans and other potential Islamic finance hubs like Suriname. In fact, there have been no attempts to examine IFL in those regions or economies. The purpose of this paper is to test and validate the IFL scale developed by Dinc et al. (2021) in an international setting. By doing so, this study elaborates on possible antecedents and levels of IFL across countries and economic systems. Design/methodology/approachThe design of the questionnaire used is based on the principles of Islamic finance and covers all the segments. The total number of collected observations is 3,579. This study uses the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to ascertain the factor structure and test the revised scale fit with the original form. Besides, IBM AMOS 25 Graphics is used for calculating the fit indexes for the scale. FindingsThe results from the CFA revealed that the scale has a good fit for its original and kept the four-dimensional structure. In addition, it also indicates that the predeveloped IFL scale is valid for different cultures, countries and individuals either having conventional or Islamic financial institutions preferences. Furthermore, results of empirical tests demonstrate that Turkey is significantly higher in Islamic financial awareness, whereas other countries' group is higher on all other subdimensions of the scale. On the other hand, female respondents indicate significantly higher levels of Islamic financial awareness, and male respondents show significantly higher levels of Islamic financial knowledge. Finally, the most prominent finding to emerge from the analysis is that the principles of Islamic finance are well accepted, except for some liberal views on the concept of "interest" (riba). Research limitations/implicationsBecause of the diverse demography of the collected sample observations, this revised scale has a homogeneous set of implications. This IFL scale can accurately measure the level of IFL attained by an individual, group, society or nation, as well as suggest necessary actions based on its four-dimensional structure. Originality/valueThis study tests the IFL scale by considering two key elements: increased sample size and vast geographical coverage. To ensure that the developed scale is universal, this study took into account more than 3,000 observations from 28 different countries. These amendments ensure the uniqueness of this paper and its originality.

TI  - A Study on Financial Literacy among University Students
T2  - PACIFIC BUSINESS REVIEW INTERNATIONAL
AB  - The rapid development in the financial markets has led to the arrival of innovative financial products and services in the market. The consumer is often in a dilemma about which financial product to choose from. Financial ignorance leads to wrong financial decisions which hamper the path to achieving holistic well-being. Financial literacy is the key requirement to make an optimal financial decision. It helps to better understand the financial initiatives of the government. Possessing financial literacy is a must skill for individuals from various domains. The core of that domain is students. They are the cornerstone of the future. While pursuing their higher education, students face numerous obstacles. They frequently struggle with time management, health, stress while trying to achieve good academic grades, and money management, along with other things. Their primary source of revenue at this crucial stage is their part-time employment or pocket money. Equipping them with smart money management skills helps them to balance their finances and academics. Financial literacy helps to achieve financial well-being which helps to reduce financial stress. An attempt is made to study financial literacy and the various socio-demographic factors affecting financial literacy among students pursuing graduation and post-graduation in Commerce from Punjabi University, Patiala. This has been highlighted in various studies that the students from the financial domain have an edge in financial concepts over students from other disciplines. The (Rooij, Lusardi, &Alessie, 2007) questionnaire based on Basic and Sophisticated Financial Literacy was used to assess financial literacy. The research relied on first-hand data gathered from 300 university students. The data was evaluated using percentage analysis, the T-test, and one-way ANOVA. The study highlighted that the mean percentage of financial literacy among students is 65.83 which is an indicator of good financial literacy.56% of university students have a good level of financial knowledge. The investigation of financial literacy across demographics revealed that female students have lower financial literacy than male students. The studies conducted by various organisations like the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and National Centre for Financial Education in India also expressed their concern about lower financial literacy among women in their studies. The T-Test findings revealed that gender and education level make a substantial difference in financial literacy levels, however residential area has no impact on financial literacy levels. The One Way ANOVA findings showed that parental qualification had no effect on students' financial literacy. This study will add more aspects to previous studies on financial literacy. Despite, studying the same curriculum why female students are still lagging in financial literacy? It will help the policymakers to frame the policies that are conducive to enhancing the financial literacy among female students. Educational institutions must focus on the practicality of the curriculum with enhanced exposure to financial terms. Early the inculcation of financial skills, the better will the financial foundation of individuals.

TI  - Impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRATEGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThe study focused on the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs at the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia, from 2019 to 2023.Design/methodology/approachThe design of the paper is empirical-analytical, focusing on the tangible and unique aspects of reality that can be fragmented for measurement. This approach privileges the use of data from the study population's experience, which is treated analytically through statistics to establish frequencies and correlations between variables. The research involved a structured questionnaire based on bibliographic references and considering the operational framework of the variables, which underwent expert review, necessary adjustments, a pilot test and subsequent validation in 2019 and 2023. The reliability of the instrument was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, ensuring a reliable indicator when equal to or greater than 0.7 in each analysis period. This methodology aimed to identify practices and how the financial profile influences short term.FindingsThe findings from the survey conducted with the microentrepreneurs at Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center reveal several significant connections to the theoretical framework. The study revealed that many microentrepreneurs relied on their personal funds for business financing, indicating a limited understanding of financial principles. Additionally, a significant portion of microentrepreneurs mitigated investment risk by securing loans from financial institutions, yet none utilized government subsidies like entrepreneurship loans, pointing to a lack of advice. The findings underscore the importance of financial education and suitable financial services for business development.Research limitations/implicationsOne limitation of this study is the lack of detailed data on the financial structure of microentrepreneurs' businesses, as well as specific information on interest rates and the terms and conditions of the microcredit used. These limitations may affect the generalization of the results and the comprehensive understanding of the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs. Future research could include a larger sample size and more accurate data on the financial structure of businesses, as well as a detailed investigation of interest rates and terms and conditions of microcredit, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the financial impacts for microentrepreneurs.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study have practical implications for microentrepreneurs in the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center. The research emphasizes the need for improved financial knowledge, accounting practices and debt management among microentrepreneurs. It also highlights the importance of financial education and access to suitable financial services for business development. The study's insights can guide the development of training programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing financial literacy and financial management among microentrepreneurs, leading to more informed decision-making and improved financial outcomes.Social implicationsFrom a social perspective, this research contributes to promoting economic development and financial inclusion. By addressing the mismanagement of microcredit by microentrepreneurs and providing insights into their short-term finances, the study aims to foster economic empowerment and sustainable development within communities.
   The findings underscore the significance of microfinance in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. The research emphasizes the importance of equitable access to financial services, which can contribute to narrowing the gap between the financially excluded population and the conventional financial system.Originality/valueThis research adds originality and value to the academic community by addressing the incidence of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs in the specific context of the Galer & iacute;as Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia. By characterizing the financial profile of microentrepreneurs, establishing the relationship between microcredit characteristics and the financial profile and proposing an action plan, the study provides valuable insights for decision-making in both the academic and microfinance fields. The research contributes to the existing literature on microfinance and financial inclusion, offering a unique perspective and potential solutions for optimizing the use of microcredit-funded resources by microentrepreneurs.

TI  - A comparative analysis of channel incentive programs in Brazil and the USA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING MARKETS
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a channel incentive program conceptual framework. In order to do so, a consolidated theoretical effort was completed together with observations from two countries - Brazil and the USA - to build evidence toward the proposed framework.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper first proposes a theoretical framework for understating marketing channel incentive programs, conceptualizing it as being composed by four dimensions being control, benefits, exclusiveness and formalization, mediated by power distribution between dealers and manufactures. Second, the developed framework was used for a cross-country analysis. Three multinational firms, global leaders in the crop protection industry, were selected in Brazil and the same three were selected in the USA. For completing each case report for the six companies in total, 16 people were interviewed, besides documental research over companies' documents.
   Findings - The framework helped describing and understanding the different group of incentives used per firm and country. Indeed, there are much more similarities within Brazil or the USA, than the same company in these two countries. The institutional environment and the network structure were fundamental to understand why the power center was different in these two countries that resulted in different channel incentive programs. In the USA, programs are very clear and straightforward in regard to a powerful dealer. If the dealer develops five or six output tasks, margins would increase considerably. In Brazil, however, dealers have a wider array of activities accompanying output measures. If they perform well they receive support, but fundamentally manufacturers strongly influence dealers' daily management decisions.
   Research limitations/implications - The incentive programs analyzed are mostly based on the set of standard documents manufacturers produced for dealers and on interviews for clarifying the content of the documents. Therefore, manufacturers probably set some relationship aspects aside since "individual approaches" to dealers might exist that were not captured in this study. Another limitation is the application to one sole industry that may per se present particularities that could be inducted too far the conceptual model that was built.
   Practical implications - The framework as suggested might first help to organize the thinking of first identifying the power distribution between manufacturer and dealers and understanding institutional and network underlying causes. The framework might then help to select the right performance measures, benefits while keeping exclusivity and formalization levels in mind. Several types of control measures and benefits are presented as examples that can be adapted to a particular situation. Special concerns should be considered when managing marketing channels with incentives in an emerging market, but mainly, one must recognize the need to identify resources limitations (financial, knowledge, or infrastructure). Second, institutions work quite inefficiently, which means that beyond legal enforcements, firms may rely heavily on additional coordination mechanisms such as incentives schemes and communication strategy to build a more social and bilateral control mechanism. Third, a manufacturer should recognize that even if they currently hold a less-dependent position to dealers, the dynamics of an emerging market may quickly change the dependence structure.
   Originality/value - The paper brings together a literature review and consolidation over the topic of channel incentive programs, proposes a framework to be used by researchers or practioners and dive in three pairs of companies in different countries to analyze why management practice should be adjusted. Differences in developing and developed countries are highlighted and the impact on channel incentives.

TI  - Retirement saving behavior: evidence from UAE
T2  - JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC MARKETING
AB  - Purpose This study aims to examine the effect of future time perspective (FTP), financial risk tolerance (FRT) and knowledge of financial planning for retirement (KFPR) on retirement saving behavior (RSB). Design/methodology/approach Primary data were collected using a non-probability judgmental sampling technique. A questionnaire was distributed either manually (by hand) or through email where 370 United Arab Emirates (UAE) residents used in the higher education sector participated. The data analysis was obtained by using SPSS and Smart-PLS software. Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate the linear relationship between FTP, FRT, KFPR and RSB. Findings The findings from this study are consistent with previous research. FTP and KFPR had a significant positive effect, while FRT had an insignificant negative effect on RSB. Research limitations/implications This study examined the effect of a few psychological variables on RSB and was conducted on a sample of university employees in the UAE. Additional research should examine environmental influences, individual differences and other psychological process factors. Furthermore, future research could extend the current study into other industries and other the Middle East and North Africa countries. Practical implications A better understanding of the factors that influence RSB can help working individuals, financial advisors/financial planning professionals, financial institutions and government/policymakers strengthen their understanding and initiatives toward retirement planning. Originality/value To the best of the authors knowledge, none of the previous research papers studied RSB in the UAE. Additionally, it is important to note that the results of this study can be generalized to all Gulf Cooperation Council countries because of the similar economic, political, ethical, social and cultural factors.

TI  - Factors determining the investment behaviour of farmers - the moderating role of socioeconomic demographics
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study is to investigate the determinants that determine the investment behaviour of rural farmers. This study further examines the moderation effect of socio traits in the association between investment behaviour and its determined factors. Design/methodology/approachThis study used a cross-sectional research design to gather information. The information for this research survey was gathered using a structured questionnaire from 400 individual investors in the rural area of Punjab, who participated in the study. It has been decided to use the Cronbach's alpha test to determine the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. To evaluate the hypothesis, structural equation modelling has been used in the research process. FindingsThe results of this study reveal that attitude, financial risk inclination, financial planning and investment intention determine the investment behaviour of the rural people of Punjab. The results for the interaction effect of socio traits with investment intention, financial risk propensity and investment attitude were found statistically significant amongst rural people. The results of the moderation effect stated that interaction between the attitude and investment intention and financial risk propensity and investment intention is significantly influenced by age of respondents. The results further reveal that marital status of rural people affect the interaction between attitude and investment intention and financial risk propensity and investment intention. Nothing about education seems to be a moderating influence on any of the relationships studied. Originality/valueThe authors contribute to the literature in two aspects. Firstly, to the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the only study of its kind that focuses on the investment behaviour of farmers. Secondly, by looking at the farmer's investing behaviour, the moderation effect of demographic variables is also studied which set this study apart from another existing scholarly research. This study contributes to the growing literature on investment behaviour of farmers in developing and developed markets.

TI  - Examining the dynamics leading towards credit card usage attitude: an empirical investigation using importance performance map analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL SERVICES MARKETING
AB  - Many researchers have investigated the consumer's attitude towards using credit cards. However, how the different attributes contribute to credit card usage attitude is not evident. Thus, the main theoretical contribution of this study is to examine the importance and performance of a set of variables that explain the attitude towards using credit cards. It provides essential inputs to banking institutions towards the relationship between bank image, credit knowledge, transaction behaviour, transaction control behaviour, and credit card usage attitude using cognitive-motivational-relational (CMR) theory. We used an adapted questionnaire to survey 383 Indian consumers from the National Capital Region (NCR). We applied variance-based partial least square structural equational modelling (PLS-SEM) on SmartPLS software to identify the importance and performance of each variable using importance performance map analysis (IMPA). Some significant findings include that credit knowledge and transaction behaviour are essential constructs determining credit card usage attitude. Moreover, the study also found that if banks enhance the credit knowledge of their consumers, they could build positive attitudes among consumers, based upon which their service marketing strategies could be shaped accordingly.

TI  - Identifying and analyzing social marketing initiatives using a theory-based approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL MARKETING
AB  - Purpose This paper aims to provide an example of how to review information and social-marketing initiatives using financial well-being as a case point. Design/methodology/approach Literature review and content analysis is used. The audience, channel, message, and evaluation framework is applied. Existent financial well-being initiatives are identified and selected, and further described and analysed in terms of their audience, channel, message and evaluation. The message is further discussed according to the transtheoretical model of change. Findings Most financial well-being campaigns focus on a particular audience, use a multichannel approach to reach their audience, and report some evaluation, consistent with the audience, channel, message and evaluation framework. Message analysis shows that several initiatives address all processes posited by the transtheoretical model of change to trigger behavior change. Potential areas of improvement and boomerang effects are identified. Practical implications - Initiatives enhance their effectiveness by using theory, using proper segmentation and channel(s) selection, creating messages based on the audiences' readiness for change and incorporating evaluation. Originality/value Theoretical and practical insight regarding financial well-being initiatives has been achieved. Campaign designers can inspire from this example to conduct their own research and analysis of existent initiatives as one of the starting points in the process.

TI  - Intelligent Architecture for Comparative Analysis of Public Companies Using Semantics and XBRL Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING
AB  - "The new source of power is not money in the hands of a few, but information in the hands of many." The aforementioned quote from John Naisbitt seems to be even more relevant in the world of finance at this very moment. Many financial decisions come from watching the information stream, selecting relevant data, analyzing it and acting accordingly. With the increasing global competition, the need for swift data analysis, high accuracy and quality becomes a must. XBRL (Extensible Business Reporting Language)(a) standard was proposed to improve efficiency of data exchange in the financial domain. However; it is still struggling with interoperability problems, not to mention comparability of data or multisource data integration. This paper presents the FLORA intelligent platform: an approach for dealing with current financial information shortcomings and achieving more er effective way of processing financial data based on the Linked Data principles. The article also explains the process of data extraction and semantic modeling which are the cornerstones of efficient financial data analysis. As a result, the FLORA architecture facilitates effective,data-driven, financial analyses and Web-scale integration between financial applications and platforms.

TI  - I share, therefore I know? Sharing online content - even without reading it - inflates subjective knowledge
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Billions of people across the globe use social media to acquire and share information. A large and growing body of research examines how consuming online content affects what people know. The present research investigates a complementary, yet previously unstudied question: how might sharing online content affect what people think they know? Sharing signals expertise, and people frequently internalize their public behavior into their private self-concepts. We therefore posit that sharing information on social media may cause people to believe they are as knowledgeable as their posts make them appear. We examine this possibility in the context of "sharing without reading," a phenomenon that allows us to isolate the effect of sharing on subjective knowledge from any influence of reading or objective knowledge. Six studies provide correlational (study 1) and causal (studies 2, 2a) evidence that sharing-even without reading-increases subjective knowledge, and test the internalization mechanism by varying the degree to which sharing publicly commits the sharer to an expert identity (studies 3-5). A seventh study investigates potential consequences of sharing-inflated subjective knowledge on downstream behavior in the domain of financial decision-making.

TI  - Determinants of credit card misuse among Gen Y consumers in urban Malaysia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BANK MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - The concept of "buy now pay later" leads Malaysian Generation Y (Gen Y) to excessively use their credit cards for spending. To gauge the extent of this worrisome scenario, the purpose of this paper is to attempt to investigate the factors, including credit attitudes, knowledge on credit card, materialism, social norm and self-efficacy, that influence credit card misuse amongst Gen Y in Malaysia.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors have collected responses from a total of 501 respondents in two urban areas in Malaysia and estimated six multiple regression models to test five hypotheses.
   Findings - The results suggest that credit card knowledge and self-efficacy are negatively related to credit card misuse amongst Gen Y in Malaysia. In contrast, positive relationships were found to exist between credit card attitudes, materialism and social norm and the dependent variable.
   Research limitations/implications - In this study, the authors limit the data collection to the two biggest urban areas in Malaysia, namely, Klang Valley and Ipoh.
   Practical implications - For the regulator's perspective, the results can be used to understand the alarming indebtedness behaviour amongst working members of Gen Y and outline appropriate and effective policies to reduce their serious indebtedness. Financial service providers, however, can collaborate with regulators to curb credit card misuse amongst Gen Y, so that the latter can avoid high bad debt from line of credit facilities and bankruptcy.
   Originality/value - The study's findings will further enrich the existing literature on the factors affecting the credit card misuse, especially for the unique Gen Y cohort in Malaysia.

TI  - Ramex-Forum: a tool for displaying and analysing complex sequential patterns of financial products
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS
AB  - Financial data provides a valuable up-to-date knowledge of the world economy. However, it is presented in extremely large data volumes, in diverse formats, and is constantly being updated at a high speed. The Ramex-Forum algorithm is oriented to guide financial experts in finding new and relevant information. We present a sensitivity analysis and new visualizations using an improved version of the Ramex-Forum algorithm. The proposed algorithm is applied to two case studies - the petroleum production chain and the European financial institutions risk analysis. Different combinations of parameters and new ways to visualize data are used. Results highlight the importance of Ramex-Forum for analysing relevant relationships in price variations in financial markets.

TI  - Graphene oxide microstrip antenna-based sensor for oxygen gas sensing in medical applications
T2  - PHYSICA SCRIPTA
AB  - In this work, we report the development of a new graphene oxide (GO) sensor based on a microstrip antenna for detecting and measuring O-2 concentration. GO was prepared from natural graphite powder using a modified Hummers procedure and then deposited upon a phenolic substrate to act as the sensing element of the designed device. Detection tests employing the sensor to evaluate oxygen gas (O-2) in higher concentrations were performed, whereas it was observed that the two operating frequencies of the device was displaced to higher values as the concentration oxygen gas increased. The effect of relative humidity (RH) in the response sensor too was observed, whereas the 9.704 GHz mode demonstrating to be the most sensitive to O-2 variation after sensitivity values have been corrected, presenting limit of detection (LOD) equal to 0.38%O-2. Evaluating the results, it is possible to note that the device studied could be used as sensor in medical equipment operating at elevated oxygen concentrations, such as ventilators, O-2 concentrators, and other medical equipment. Moreover, evaluated sensor would be a promisor candidate for healthcare monitoring applications for the reason that this device could act as both an O-2 sensor and antenna, and thus transmitting their information to other devices.
