AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this research is to develop a multidimensional measurement of fashion domain entrepreneurial self-efficacy (FDESE) based on which fashion entrepreneurs will be able to better develop strategies to gain and sustain success in their business development. The research is crucial to advocate fashion entrepreneurship and will provide direction for fashion business incubation services. Design/methodology/approach: This research included three stages with mixed qualitative and quantitative approaches: conceptualizing construct definition and specifying domain(s) to generate initial items, scale purification and scale validation. This study started with reviewing the literature and individual interviews among 19 fashion entrepreneurs, which generated 72 initial items. An online survey was then conducted with individuals who are running or have the intention to run fashion businesses, yielding 249 useable samples for scale purification, which generated 21 items for the validation phase. Lastly, another online survey was administered to individuals who are currently running fashion businesses which resulted in 258 valid responses included for scale validation. Findings: A measure of FDESE that is both reliable and valid was developed, including 21 items across four distinct dimensions: passion for fashion business (five items), marketing and branding (seven items), financial management (five items) and creativity (four items). Originality/value: This study is the first attempt to develop practical scales measuring self-efficacy that focus on fashion domain entrepreneurship. The newly developed FDESE scale indicates that entrepreneurship not only involves marketing skills, financial knowledge, creativity, leadership, and proactivity but also requires passion and persistence. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the influence of the profile of cultural entrepreneurs (CE), in terms of their demographic characteristics and resources, on the performance of cultural and creative firms (CCFs). Design/methodology/approach: Departing from demographic theory and resource-based view, two hypotheses have been formulated and empirically tested, using a multiple regression model, with a sample of 80 Spanish CCFs. The CCF performance has been measured through two objective (employment growth and profitability) and one subjective/perceptual measurements (satisfaction of the CE with the attainment of objectives). Findings: With respect to the demographic variables, a negative relationship between the CE’s age and employment growth, and a partial positive influence of the CE’s prior experience on employment growth and the subjective measurement of performance have been found. Regarding to the CE’s resources, the empirical evidence shows that there is no direct relationship between the CE’s possession of any resources studied − financial, knowledge and social connections − and CCF performance. Originality/value: This work makes three important contributions as it analyses the CE and focuses on CCF management, a topic little discussed in the entrepreneurship literature. Second, there is an analysis of some of the variables pertaining to the entrepreneur’s demographic profile that have been applied to top management teams and in a more or less isolated way in the entrepreneurship area. And, finally, a multidimensional measurement is used to explain the CCF performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The technological revolution we have been witnessing over the last 30 years is bringing about important changes in business management, specifically in the conception, development, and management of its financial aspects. How to face these challenges is a particularly critical question for individual entrepreneurs who have to assume a much greater responsibility for decisions than in other corporate environments. In this sense, it is very important to understand the financial capabilities and skills and their limitations of this type of entrepreneurship, which is so important for the renewal and extension of the business community in any developed economy. Based on an extensive official survey of this type of entrepreneurship, this research proposes a logistic regression modeling, in order to find out the level of financial knowledge of this business group. One of the findings of this research is that individual entrepreneurs have a higher level of financial knowledge than salaried workers, with a higher qualification in this respect in the case of individual entrepreneurs with employees. This study analyses the link between individual entrepreneurs or self-employed workers – with or without employees – and financial literacy. In addition, we investigated the relationship between this group with their socio-demographic characteristics, financial product holdings, financial planning, and financial fragility. Different binary logistic regression models with maximum likelihood were estimated using a sample of individual entrepreneurs and self-employed workers from the Survey of Financial Competences database conducted in Spain to achieve this. The results of the study show that individuals who choose to be individual entrepreneurs or self-employed, and in particular those with hired workers, had a higher level of financial literacy than salaried workers. Moreover, it was confirmed that financial literacy complements the explanatory power of the other variables analyzed with respect to sole proprietors without employees, although not to a significant degree. The limitations of this work are due to the use of data from the Financial Skills Survey, so some dichotomous variables offer very generic information. In addition, the database is cross-sectional and we cannot analyze variations between different periods. No research before had applied the relationships between the behavior of individual entrepreneurs, with and without employees, and financial competencies using logistic functions and on the basis of a rigorous and comprehensive formal questionnaire. The conclusions provide a valuable perspective for developing training programs for this type of human capital aimed at raising the financial skills of individual entrepreneurs to improve personal and business management. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Advancements in financial system and technology, enlarged individual responsibility for financial decisions, and rapid information expansion, have fundamentally transformed women's need to be functionally literate and financially capable, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. The personality also has long term implications on financial well-being. The aim of the paper is to study the dominating role of financial attitude, financial awareness & skills, and financial behaviour on financial competence and the moderating role of personality on financial knowledge, financial behaviour, financial attitude, and financial capability. Multi stage stratified random sampling has been used to collect data from 530 urban working women in both the Public and Private sectors, self-employed professionals, and entrepreneurs. Smart-PLS is used by applying Structure Equation Modelling (SEM) to study the moderating role of personality on financial attitude, behaviour, knowledge, and capability. Further the Chi-square test and Tukey test and Kruskal Wallis Test are used to test the hypothesis. The study found that Financial Knowledge of working women with gold personalities influences their financial capability (Beta, 0.578) the most, While, Financial Behaviour is the primary influencer having green (Beta, 0.396) & blue (Beta, 0.638) personalities. Working women having Green Personality are found to be superior with respect to Financial Behaviour, Financial Capability and Financial Knowledge. It is also observed that working women having blue personality characteristics, have comparatively better financial attitude. © 2022 WITPress. All rights reserved.

AB  - Notwithstanding a recent upsurge in interest in knowledge intermediaries and their roles in innovation support systems, we know little about the interplay between the activities of academia-driven intermediaries and their publicly financed counterparts. Building on a combination of principles derived from the resource-based theory and entrepreneurial ecosystems literature, this paper investigates the potentials of cooperation between different knowledge intermediaries. Therefore, the authors analyze the alignment of financial, knowledge, market and network resources in politically funded regional alliances between university-internal and university-external intermediaries by means of a qualitative approach. They find that, while knowledge intermediaries can benefit from access to additional ecosystem-specific resources, the urge to improve their own position within the ecosystem hampers the will to cooperate and can lead to non-performing resource alignments. The paper contributes to current scholarly discussions by suggesting and testing a theoretical foundation for analyzing the cooperative behavior of knowledge intermediaries in innovation support systems. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Purpose: Inadequate finance is considered a major factor limiting the growth of small-scale women-owned farm enterprises in Sub-Saharan Africa. Women empowerment programs such as table banking (TB) and women enterprise fund were initiated in an attempt to curb the credit gap affecting women in agribusiness. This paper determines the factors influencing the extent of credit access among women farm-entrepreneurs who are either members or nonmembers of TB groups in Kenya. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted in Kericho County using a sample of 384 respondents. Factor analysis was used to generate three indicators of entrepreneurial orientation which were included as explanatory variables in the regressions. Double hurdle econometric model was employed to analyze the factors influencing the decisions on credit uptake and amount of borrowed loan. Separate models were estimated for members and nonmembers of TB groups since they differed in volume and source of loan accessed. Findings: Results reveal that age of the woman and innovativeness negatively influenced credit access, whereas education level, participation in off-farm activities, number of farm enterprises, perception on interest rate, extension contacts and financial knowledge positively influenced the decision to access credit. On the other hand, participation in off-farm activities, risk-taking behavior, total land size, extension access and financial knowledge were statistically significant with positive correlation on the amount of loan borrowed. Significant factors differ between members and nonmembers of TB groups implying divergence in underlying credit access challenges once one has joined such groups. Research limitations/implications: The study did not consider supply-side factors affecting the amount of loan accessed by women farm-entrepreneurs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is one of the pioneer studies using the double hurdle model to analyze factors influencing the extent of credit access specifically among women farm-entrepreneurs and carrying out the analysis by membership in TB groups. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to establish the moderating effect of financial literacy in the relationship between access to finance and growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in developing economies. Thus, this study seeks to establish whether financial literacy moderates the relationship between access to finance and growth of SMEs in a developing economy like Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: Cross-sectional research design was used in the study and data were collected from 169 SMEs located in Jinja and Iganga central markets. ModGraph (excel programme) was used to test for the moderating effect of financial literacy in the relationship between access to finance and growth of SMEs in developing economies. Findings: The findings reveal a positive and significant moderating effect of financial literacy in the relationship between access to finance and growth of SMEs in developing economies. In addition, financial literacy and access to finance also have significant and positive effects on growth of SMEs in developing economies. Research limitations/implications: The study collected data from only SMEs located in Uganda, and there is an opportunity to test this finding in other developing economies. Furthermore, the findings from the study are based on quantitative data collected through use of semi-structured questionnaires. Besides, the study was purely cross-sectional; hence, it ignores the characteristics of SMEs, which could be investigated using a longitudinal study design. Practical implications: The study highlights the importance of financial literacy in promoting access to finance, which is necessary for the growth of SMEs in developing economies. Owners of SMEs could attend financial literacy programmes provided by entrepreneurial skill development organizations to enable them to acquire financial knowledge and skills to make wise and better financial decisions and choices. Originality/value: The study contributes to existing international entrepreneurship literature by indicating the moderating effect of financial literacy in the relationship between access to finance and growth of SMEs in developing economies. The study shows that for SMEs to access finance to grow there is a need for financial literacy that promotes effective and efficient use of loans/credits. SMEs in developing economies need financial literacy, which helps them make wise financial decisions and choices before accessing financial services like loans. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to study the status of financial literacy among small scale entrepreneurs (SSEs) in a small district of Tamil Nadu state in India. The study is based on factors influencing small scale entrepreneurs to know about financial services; the problems faced by SSE while availing financial services; their satisfaction towards banking services; and appropriate measures to be taken for improving financial literacy among SSEs. The study implemented a mixed methodology research design using both qualitative and quantitative methods. A survey was conducted among 150 selected small scale entrepreneurs using convenient sampling technique. The results of Garrett Ranking Technique showed that majority of respondents are influenced by knowledge about financial products, followed by knowledge of financial numeracy, money management, budgeting, timely payment of bills, intensity to save, propensity to consume, risk aversion and trusted financial advice. Results of Chi-Square test revealed that the demographic profiles are not significantly related to the problems of the SSEs. © 2017, ASERS Publishing House. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the level of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) business owners–managers’ financial literacy and its impact on firm’s performance. The article applied a random sample and structural equation modelling (SEM) approaches in assessing the influence of SME business owners–managers’ level of financial literacy within the three states in the southwest Nigeria. The findings show the complete effect of business owner–manager’s financial knowledge, financial awareness and financial attitude in converting financial literacy to increase in firm performance. Also, they confirm that financial knowledge and awareness of SME business owners–managers are obviously not a prerequisite for the performance of SMEs, but entrepreneur characteristics in decision-making and relationship to financial attitude have a comparison with financial literacy. The research limitation evolves from cross section information observation that solely covers the southwestern part of the country. Additionally, inspired to meet the analysis gap is panel data analysis. Training courses through strategic orientation on the attitudinal perception of SME business owner–manager and basic business management skills, capacity-building aspect, leadership development as well as networking via relationship marketing and management on financial literacy may have significant effect on SMEs’ performance and growth for the managers in general in Nigeria. The article is one of the first to examine the level of financial literacy of SME business owners–managers in Nigeria. The article therefore sets an important benchmark for further research in this area. © 2017, © 2017 International Management Institute, New Delhi.

AB  - Using a representative survey of Dutch entrepreneurs and self-employed individuals, (i) we measure their subjective financial knowledge and the extent to which they ask for advice when managing their companies, and (ii) we examine whether subjective financial knowledge and the demand for advice are related to the firm economic performance. We find that the respondents feel more comfortable with accounting subjects than they do with strategic ones, of which they feel that they know the least. Entrepreneurs with a greater extent of financial knowledge are more likely to report a higher gross margin and higher revenue growth for their firm. These entrepreneurs are also less likely to seek advice and to delegate financial decisions. Seeking professional advice does not increase the likelihood of an entrepreneur having better performance. Our results suggest that entrepreneurs’ degree of financial knowledge is related to the success of their businesses, while seeking advice is not significantly correlated with better firm performance. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study intends to handle the latter gap: different results of the determinants of financial inclusion, i.e., financial literacy, age, income, and education. Furthermore, it applies the quantitative design, examining the statistical hypotheses. Additionally, the snowball sampling method chose the population of female entrepreneurs in Indonesia. Through the survey in 2022, this study effectively obtained one hundred and fifty-two samples and their responses. Furthermore, the logistic regression model and classification matrix analyze the obtained data. According to this study’s measurements of access, savings, and credit accounts (AA, SA, and CA), financial literacy effectively increases the financial inclusion of female entrepreneurs. At the same time, demographic features, i.e., age, income, and education, have a positive effect on these accounts. The classification accuracy of financial literacy towards AA, SA, and CA is 94.1%, 80.3%, and 95.4%, respectively. For age, the accuracy is 72.4% for AA, 81.6% for SA, and 67.1% for CA. For income, the accuracy is 89.5% for AA, 85.5% for SA, and 96.1% for CA. For education, the accuracy is 88.2% for AA, 78.3% for SA, and 94.7% for CA. Considering this evidence, businesswomen must have the financial knowledge to choose access, savings, and credit accounts to sustain and grow their business scope. For this purpose, central and local government support is still vital to assist them. © 2024 Conscientia Beam. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Under the backdrop of economic globalization and the digital economy, entrepreneurial behavior has emerged not only as a focal point of management research but also as an urgent topic within the domain of family finance. This paper scrutinizes the ramifications of financial literacy on household entrepreneurial behavior utilizing data from China’s sample of the China Household Finance Survey spanning the years 2015 and 2017. Employing the ordered Probit model, we pursue our research objectives. Our findings suggest that financial literacy exerts immediate, persistent, and evolving positive effects on households’ engagement in entrepreneurial activities and their proclivity toward entrepreneurship. Through the mitigation of endogeneity in the regression model, the outcomes of the two-stage regression corroborate the primary regression results. An examination of heterogeneity unveils noteworthy disparities between urban and rural areas, as well as gender discrepancies, in how financial literacy influences household entrepreneurial behavior. Furthermore, this study validates three potential pathways—namely income, social network, and risk attitude channels—demonstrating that financial literacy significantly augments household income, expands social networks, and enhances risk attitudes. Moreover, through supplementary analysis, we ascertain that financial education amplifies the impact of financial literacy on entrepreneurial behavior. Our study contributes to the enrichment of human capital theory and modern entrepreneurship theory. It advocates for robust efforts by governments and financial institutions to widely disseminate financial knowledge and foster family entrepreneurship, thereby fostering the robust and stable operation of both the global financial market and the job market. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Having subject knowledge is not the sufficient for an engineering student especially in the recent economic status of the country. Students are expected to require skills such as problem-solving, communication skills, dealing with information and abilities to ensure their employability in future. Nowadays most of the graduates are interested in starting a business of their own. Moreover, entrepreneurs are one among the important factors for the economic growth in a country. Knowing about entrepreneurship includes management, marketing skills, and finance. In addition, knowledge about financial management is also required for learners to know the commercial opportunities to face the business issues. Apart from this, creating a mindset for engineering students to involve in business should also be considered. The present article observes the role of engineering students in sustaining the Economic Development and their awareness about the financial systems of the country. The paper deals with the issue that how far teaching about the economic aspects is taking place in engineering classes. Since engineers play a prominent role in developing financial status of the country much emphasis is not given to teaching economic and financial knowledge for engineering students. Therefore the paper suggest that knowledge about economic aspects of the country has to be imparted in engineering classes to show that engineers are also responsible for development of the country. © IAEME Publication.

AB  - Developing financial literacy is a crucial part of entrepreneurship. It can aid aspiring entrepreneurs to learn how to analyze market trends, formulate business plans, conduct cost accounting activities, and navigate fiscal risks in their businesses. Therefore, we investigated the most recent dataset on rural residents in China to determine the effects of financial literacy on their entrepreneurial behaviors. Our observations reveal that individuals with high financial literacy, that is, those who have attained advanced financial knowledge, are more likely to start a business than those with low financial literacy. We employed instrumental variable analysis to mitigate the endogeneity of financial literacy. Results show a causal relationship between Chinese rural residents’ financial literacy and entrepreneurship. Finally, we demonstrate that the aggressive risk attitudes of rural families magnify the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurship. © 2024

AB  - This paper analyzes differences in attitudes and strategies for investing and entrepreneurship among families receiving remittances from their overseas emigrants at two rural communities in the Philippines. It examines how these households in the origin country determine how to invest remittances, and the extent to which these decisions are influenced by topographical, socio-economic, political, and cultural factors in their local spatial contexts. How do individual behaviors, along with risk appetite and financial capabilities, interact with such contexts as origin households assess the hazards and likely returns of investing locally? Primary data collected through household surveys in 2018–2019, and a rapid qualitative inquiry methodology, enable us in this mixed methods research to explore the interplay between individual financial behaviors and spatial factors affecting decision making. We can report that migrants’ origin households, and local financial institutions and entrepreneurs, employ relevant costing in reaching economic decisions, and assess favorable and adverse investment considerations explicitly. Remittance-supported economic development in origin communities relies on enhancements in household financial knowledge, and on interventions —through policy and regulation— to sustain and improve the local investment climate. If these conditions are met, households and local investors and entrepreneurs will make productive decisions through this relevant costing strategy and will contribute resources that promote microeconomic development. Relevant costing is thereby vindicated as a valuable concept, in attempts to unravel besetting complexities in the migration–development nexus. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using a novel large database of Italian micro-entrepreneurs, we investigate how different sources of external business advice affect access to alternative finance. We distinguish three categories of external business advice: professional financial, professional non-financial, and non-professional. We also test whether financial knowledge of micro-entrepreneurs enhances their advice seeking for financial decision-making. We find that the use of alternative financial instruments increases when external business advisors are used, but some are more useful than others. Only professional financial advice is shown to increase the probability of accessing alternative finance by micro-enterprises, while non-professional and professional non-financial advice does not have the same effect. We also find that being more financially literate increases the probability that micro-entrepreneurs seek advice from highly professional sources, i.e., objective financial knowledge helps shape the quality of financial advice requested. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Financial literacy is the ability of people to process economic information to make better financial decisions. Therefore, the financial literacy of entrepreneurs could affect the management of their companies and their results. The aim of this research is to determine if there is a significant relationship between companies’ performance and financial knowledge, financial behavior, and financial attitude of micro, small, and medium-sized entrepreneurs. The incidence of the variables age, size, and sector of the companies, as well as the entrepreneur’s age, gender, and educational level on companies’ performance, is also analyzed. Data from 206 entrepreneurs from Veracruz, Mexico, were analyzed using a logistic regression model. The results show that the financial behavior of the entrepreneurs has a positive and highly significant effect on companies’ performance, although the entrepreneur´s knowledge and attitude don´t have a significant relationship with companies´ performance. The results also show that companies in the industrial sector led by men are less likely to obtain high performance compared to those in the commerce sector. No incidence was found of the variables age, size of the company, and entrepreneur´s educational level on the performance of their companies. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The study examines the influence of the five pillars of inclusive financing on the empowerment of micro-, smalland medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and the influence of institutional conditions on the empowerment of MSMEs. This study uses primary and secondary data. The population of the study are MSMEs; the is a total of 930,620 MSMEs in Jakarta. Owners of micro-, smalland medium-sized enterprises is a good population to be measured because they are the main actors that know exactly the challenges and the obstacles in doing business addressing problems faced in inclusive financing, which is related to the purpose of the study. The research borrows from finance and entrepreneurial theories for model design. The results of the study show that all the variables are significant and positive in the efforts to finance MSMEs in Indonesia, which means that financial education plays an important role in the sustainability of financial inclusion. The financial theory, developed to explain financing at the company level, needs to be adapted to the entrepreneurial situation, so that it can explain the behavior of small businesses. This means that, with correct financial knowledge, financial inclusion plays an important role in the sustainability of MSMEs in Indonesia. © Copyright: The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

AB  - We investigate the limited use of bank and microfinance loans by Tanzanian female entrepreneurs. Using survey data, we observe that female entrepreneurs mainly use informal sources to finance their businesses. We analyze how “perceptions” of gendered cognitive and normative institutions determine whether a female entrepreneur applies for a formal loan. Following results stand out: first, we find that high collateral requirements, interest rates and personal guarantee requirements make formal loans unattractive. Second, female entrepreneurs only apply when they expect to be successful. Since they “perceive” access to finance to be more problematic for women, female entrepreneurs are discouraged from applying. Third, female entrepreneurs “perceive” they have insufficient access to financial knowledge which again will prevent them from applying. This study contributes to theory by exploring the effect of entrepreneurs’ perceptions of the institutional business environment on financing behavior. Furthermore, we show that the low use of formal loans by female entrepreneurs is primarily demand-driven, which calls into question the effectivity of policy recommendations aiming to increase supply of formal loans. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Motivated by the recent increases in entrepreneurship in developing countries, this empirical article aims at determining the risk preferences of male and female entrepreneurs using cross-sectional data from 161 MSMEs in Ghana, and the Arrow-Pratt risk model. A multiple linear regression was later employed to ascertain factors influencing entrepreneurs’ attitudes toward risk. A decomposition of the risk attitude shows Ghanaian entrepreneurs to be generally risk averse. Upon further investigation, we find males to be more extreme risk averse than females, while females are more risk neutral than males. The gender difference in risk aversion is significantly explained by predictor variables, such as socio-economic factors, having access to funds, type of business operated, sector of operation, financial knowledge, and the cultural values of the entrepreneurs. We find a positive relationship between financial knowledge and attitude toward risk, and recommend the need for investment in both formal and informal education that increases the financial knowledge of entrepreneurs, hence, reduce the risk associated with entrepreneurship in Ghana. Theoretically, the article integrates cultural, financial knowledge, and religious variables into the determinant of risk attitude of male and female entrepreneurs and practically demonstrates that increasing the financial knowledge decreases the risk aversion nature of entrepreneurs. © 2021 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil Canadien de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.

AB  - This study examines the effects of digital financial inclusion on non-farm employment of rural labor and the mediating mechanism of innovation and entrepreneurship activity using China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and the provincial index of digital financial inclusion. Through the empirical test of the Probit model and mediation effect model, we found that: firstly, digital financial inclusion can promote non-farm employment of rural labor, with the level of digitalization having the most significant impact; secondly, by encouraging innovation and entrepreneurial activity, digital financial inclusion can promote non-farm employment of rural labor; thirdly, the driving effect of digital financial inclusion on non-farm employment of rural labor is more pronounced among the unmarried, eastern region, and male labor. Therefore, we should improve the construction of rural digital infrastructure and accelerate the development of inclusive rural finance to promote more diversified non-farm employment options for “disadvantaged groups”; encourage and support innovation at the government level, and create a favorable atmosphere for innovation and entrepreneurship. Simultaneously, farmers’ digital literacy and financial knowledge should be improved so that more can adopt and take advantage of digital financial inclusion. © 2023 Shandong Normal University

AB  - This article presents the results of the financial literacy assessment of young Mexican students between the ages of 17 and 24 enrolled in public and private institutions in five Mexican cities. This study’s objective was to approach the financial knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes of young Mexicans through focus groups and questionnaires to identify their perceptions of complex thinking and its use for financial products and services. The most relevant findings suggest that (a) most of the young participants in the study use banking services through their parents, (b) there are significant gender differences in financial knowledge and behaviors, (c) critical thinking significantly and positively correlates with financial behaviors and attitudes, and (d) the level of critical thinking predicts financial behavior. There is a need to develop women’s critical thinking to discern between the financial behavior they socially imitate and their capabilities to become more involved in financial issues, thus decreasing the gender gap. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This paper attempts to study the impact of Financial Literacy on Youth Entrepreneurial Intent in Pakistan. A closed-ended self-administered structured questionnaire covering financial literacy, computer knowledge, financial attitude, and financial knowledge with Entrepreneurial Intent was collected from young entrepreneurs. The research tried to investigate the education level with computer skill to inspect the effect of financial literateness on young generation Entrepreneurial Intent in the context of Pakistan. The research model was tested using PLS-SEM and authenticating a measurement model through the advanced methodology and their association with Entrepreneurial Intent. Results revealed that financial literacy and its two parts (financial attitude and financial knowledge) have a positive impact on Entrepreneurial Intent. The size of the joint impact of financial literacy and its components on Entrepreneurial Intent was assessed to be adequate. Entrepreneurial Intent is essential for creating new firms to maintain economic development. Furthermore, it is determined in this research that if youth has better financial knowledge and financial attitude, the probability of Entrepreneurial Intent increases. This suggests that if the youth in Pakistan desire to attain a higher limit of Entrepreneurial Intent, they must implement financial literacy models for enhancing and promoting their current Entrepreneurial Intent. © 2021.

AB  - Financial well-being is a key component of quality of life and overall well-being and is likely to affect other aspects of quality of life, such as health and health care. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an immense crisis of financial well-being among low-income entrepreneurs and has left many small-scale entrepreneurs financially fragile. We argue that promoting the financial capability of low-income entrepreneurs is effective in protecting their financial well-being from a crisis. To examine the association between financial capability and the financial well-being of low-income entrepreneurs, we use the 2016 National Financial Well-Being Survey, which provides the latest and comprehensive measurement of financial capability, including financial knowledge, financial skills, and access to financial products and services. Our analyses show that, compared to their higher-income counterparts, low-income entrepreneurs have statistically lower levels of financial well-being, financial knowledge, financial skills, and access to mainstream financial products; they also have a statistically higher risk of using high-fee alternative financial products. In addition, low-income entrepreneurs have larger barriers to accessing mainstream financial products than low-income non-entrepreneurs. The results indicate that financial capability plays a significant role in promoting the financial well-being of low-income entrepreneurs. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Entrepreneurial mind-set, knowledge and skills to recognise opportunities and implement ideas are vital competences for achieving success in the midst of rapid global changes. The main purpose of the entrepreneurship education is to foster those competencies. The present paper focuses on the role of the university education in developing various entrepreneurship competences, and the share of entrepreneurs among the alumni. The aim is more specifically to examine the relationship between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurship competence development in university and the later entrepreneurial activities of the engineering alumni. The analysis is based on a questionnaire survey of alumni entrepreneurship conducted in 2016 as a part of a programme ‘Edu ja Tegu-Development of entrepreneurial education throughout all educational levels’. Chi-square tests, t-tests are used to compare the engineering alumni of Estonian University of Life Sciences with graduates from other fields. The overall share of entrepreneurs among the engineering alumni was 35.6%. The entrepreneurial activities were impacted by the time of graduation. It had also impact of whether the graduates had received entrepreneurship courses during their studies. In comparison with other alumni, the engineering graduates assessed that their university education helped them develop significantly better problem-solving skills, critical thinking, self-evaluation skills, ability to develop new ideas and solutions and leadership skills and obtained significantly less entrepreneurial and financial knowledge during their studies. However, in case of engineering alumni, entrepreneurship education did not have significant impact on their entrepreneurial activities and assessments of competences, thus indicating that other factors are in play. © 2019, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

AB  - There is limited literature on the causes, correlates, and consequences of being a saver (tightwad) or a spender (spendthrift). This paper reports on five studies which look at demographic, bright- and dark-side personality, money belief, and self-evaluation correlates of to what extent a person considers themselves a spender or saver. In each study, adult participants indicated their spender–saver habits on a single scale and completed a number of tests. The first study looked at trait correlates and showed savers were close-minded, conscientious, stable, extraverts. It also showed as predicted that savers were more likely to associate money with security, and not love or freedom, and claim to have better financial knowledge. The results from the second study on dark-side personality correlates indicated that spenders were more likely to have psychopathic tendencies, but less likely to be Machiavellian. The third study on personality disorder correlates of spender–saver tendencies suggested that spenders were likely to have elevated Cluster B personality disorders. The fourth study examined self-beliefs and showed savers rated themselves as more attractive, healthy, and intelligent than spenders. The fifth study, also using various self-ratings, showed spenders had more liberal political views, report higher emotional intelligence and are less likely to own their own home, while savers rated their physical health higher, and saw themselves as more entrepreneurial. Overall, the results suggest the simple saver–spender question is logically correlated with a number of individual difference variables with savers having a more positive profile.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the relationship between financial literacy and financial well-being among businesspersons in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, México. The applied methodology includes confirmatory factor analysis and multiple linear regression models. Our results indicate that financial literacy is related to financial well-being directly through its financial behavior component and inversely through financial attitude. Moreover, financial knowledge was not significantly associated with it. Hence, we propose the following recommendations for businesspeople and entrepreneurs: becoming more involved in healthy financial inclusion and financial literacy practices and inspiring their transition from models focused solely on profits to others considering their self-realization and satisfaction. Its main limitations and implications are the scarcity of data to perform an analysis by industry, its geographical outreach, and its public policy repercussions. Its originality lies in analyzing financial well-being among businesspeople, a topic rarely studied in Mexico. Our conclusions impact the implementation of the financial inclusion policy in Mexico and, therefore, contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas.

AB  - This study aims to examine the factors that affect entrepreneurial awareness and intention in Junior High School students This research used a quantitative approach with PLS-SEM by considering that the model employed unobserved variables and measured using different scale. This research applied convenience sampling and obtained 97 Junior High School students spread across Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi (the Greater Jakarta) as the research samples. Furthermore, this research proved that entrepreneurial awareness and self-efficacy significantly affected entrepreneurial intention. On the other hand, entrepreneurship education, financial knowledge, and entrepreneurship experience did not significantly affect entrepreneurial intention. Meanwhile, entrepreneurial awareness was influenced by financial knowledge. The results proved that financial knowledge mediated the effects of financial socialization on entrepreneurial intention and entrepreneurial awareness. Meanwhile, financial knowledge had some effects on entrepreneurial intention through entrepreneurial awareness. The empirical results emphasized the importance of the role of families and schools in building entrepreneurial awareness and intention.  © 2023 Umi Widyastuti et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Entrepreneurial intention still becomes an interesting topic to be observed, although it has been explored widely. This study examines the role of family and school on students' entrepreneurial intentions. The role of family was reflected in financial socialization, while entrepreneurship education represented the school's contribution to explaining entrepreneurial intention. Using 109 secondary students, this study analyzed the data using a quantitative approach using the Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM). This approach was applied to answer the direct and indirect effects of confirming entrepreneurial intention. The results proved that financial socialization has a significant impact on financial knowledge. At the same time, entrepreneurial intention was determined by financial knowledge, financial socialization, and entrepreneurship education. Financial knowledge has a mediating role in explaining the impact of financial socialization on entrepreneurial intention. © 2023, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

AB  - This research aims to investigate the role of financial self-efficacy in mediating the relationship between entrepreneurial education and venture capital intention, as well as the moderating influence of government support on the relationship between financial self-efficacy and venture capital intention. The target population consists of Lahore students from public and private universities who have already studied entrepreneurship. Based on the 250 responses to the online survey the findings show the mediating role of financial self-efficacy between entrepreneurial education and intention toward venture capital. Moreover, it also indicates the moderated effect of government support on the relationship between financial self-efficacy and intention toward venture capital. This study will not only help the curriculum committees in business schools to design entrepreneurial education outlines that enable the students to explore the different financing modes by including financial knowledge to cope with financial challenges but also to the government officials in devising financing plans accompanied by their expertise in the development of a business.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine entrepreneurship in the context of future Finnish teachers’ readiness to teach 21st century (broad-based) competencies. Teachers’ self-efficacy in teaching entrepreneurial skills and financial matters is vital for their pupils to actively participate and flourish in future society. The study utilized survey data of future teachers’ expectancy-values in teaching seven broad-based competencies of the current national curriculum and their financial literacy. Future teachers expressed high interest in all competencies but reported the least self-efficacy and highest cost in teaching ICT as well as working life and entrepreneurship competencies. Teaching self-efficacy (TSE) in entrepreneurial competencies was predicted by subjective evaluations of financial capability and TSE in consumer skills. Teaching STEM subjects as well as male gender were related to better objective financial knowledge. We discuss the implications of observed financial capability, lack in self-efficacy, and high experienced cost of teaching these competencies. Support for future teachers’ readiness to teach working life skills, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy through phenomenon-based school subject collaboration, formal teacher training, and digital applications are emphasized. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigates the essential characteristics of the personal financial landscape of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Saudi Arabia, with a specific focus on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 154 respondents, comprising owners, managers, and administrators of Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises (MSMEs) in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, were surveyed to gather data. The results of the study indicate that younger entrepreneurs and businesses experienced greater financial consequences, particularly among owners aged 18–30 and 31–45, compared to older age groups. However, both younger and older entrepreneurs demonstrated a higher level of financial knowledge and awareness regarding emergency finance options. Overall, the outbreak had a significant impact on both the national and global economies. This study offers a significant contribution to the extant body of literature pertaining to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). © 2023 asociación Cuadernos de economía.

AB  - Low business outlook due to poor financial decisions among students has continued to attract interest of financial educators and professionals. Previous studies have interrogated financial literacy with sparse attention given to business risk-taking among students' start-ups in Nigeria. This research gap forms the basis of this study. The aim of this paper is the interrogation of financial knowledge and financial behavior as a lever for business risk-taking among start-up students of the University of Lagos, Nigeria. The philosophical perspective drew insight from the positivist approach with a random sampling of 145 final-year students selected from the departments of Business Administration, Accounting and Employment, and Labour Relations of the Faculty of Management Sciences. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test and Bartlett's test were conducted to determine sample adequacy. Regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses. The results show that financial knowledge and behavior of start-ups revealed a high propensity to be engaged in business risk-taking (β = .407, t (511) = 7.556, p < 0.05; β = .412, t (1.511) = 7.525, p < 0.05) with males showing more financial literacy understanding for business risk than females (β = .591, t (2;510) = 4.381, p < 0.05; β = .280, t (2;510) = 2.217, p = 0.262) respectively. The findings show the need for the continuous development of students' start-up behavioral and attitudinal disposition, especially females in becoming more financial literate for appropriate financial decision-making in business risk-taking and venture creation. © 2022 LLC CPC Business Perspectives.

AB  - How does a founder's knowledge of debt financing influence his/her new firm's ability to obtain the amount of debt financing it desires? Building on the cognitive psychology literature, we propose that the depth of a founder's debt financing knowledge is positively associated with the new firm's ability to obtain debt financing as he/she will be better at selecting and acquiring relevant sources of debt financing. Integrating insights on entrepreneurial growth-oriented strategies, we further argue that this relationship will be more pronounced when the new firm internationalizes and innovates more. Using a Heckman full information maximum likelihood model, we analyse survey data on 1845 Flemish new firms. The first stage of the model estimates the new firm's probability of raising debt financing. The second stage tests the relationship between the founder's knowledge depth of debt financing and the new firm's debt financing ability, conditional on the decision to raise debt financing. We find that the founder's knowledge depth of debt financing is positively associated with the new firm's ability to obtain debt financing. This association becomes even more pronounced when the new firm internationalizes more. These findings extend the entrepreneurial finance, entrepreneurial strategy and cognitive psychology literature. © 2023 British Academy of Management.

AB  - An entrepreneur is often driven by a quest for innovation and creativity in a market, thus creating competition. The competition will create wealth, leading to improved living standards for individuals and the economy at large. Moreover, innovation and creation result in new and superior products that enable modern markets to be developed. However, the enthusiasm to become an entrepreneur is not the sole driving factor. One must know the importance of financial literacy. Besides, the negative stigma due to the COVID-19 pandemic ruined many lives and impacted businesses with less money due to the reduction of clientele; also, it had impacted budding entrepreneurs (at early start-up stages, and hardly have had experience between 1-3 years) with fewer opportunities to make money. That reduced the willingness of entrepreneurs to invest capital in the business due to raging losses. The current article presents the importance of financial literacy for budding entrepreneurs. To find and measure the financial literacy among budding entrepreneurs, the data were distributed to 223 entrepreneurs; however, 179 were finally used for analysis due to several reasons mentioned in the research methodology. The data was collected from five districts of the South region of India (Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu) and the snowball technique is used in the analysis. The study revealed that most budding entrepreneurs lack proper financial literacy. The study found that Financial Skills, Financial Knowledge, Financial Attitude, Social Interactions & Past Experiences, Financial Support & Guidance directly influenced Financial Literacy levels among entrepreneurs. The study also suggests that aspiring entrepreneurs should be given practical financial training sessions; it should be made mandatory. © Universal Journal of Accounting and Finance 2021.

AB  - Poor financial decisions are a primary cause of small firm failure. This research therefore reports on an examination of antecedents behind questionable financial borrowing practices among self-employed individuals. Poor financial decisions are proxied as the use of high-cost short-term payday loans, check-cashing services, and the like (collectively, alternative financial services, AFS). More than 20 percent of self-employed individuals in the United States reported having borrowed from AFS providers, a practice that is arguably symptomatic of the poor financial decisions that could lead to business failure. Self-employed individuals, particularly those with high levels of financial self-efficacy (an attribute important to entrepreneurship) are particularly likely to employ AFS borrowing. Overconfident individuals, including self-employed individuals, comprise a disproportionate fraction of AFS users. This work also found that financial knowledge among self-employed people is, on average, no higher than that among employees, and low financial knowledge is also associated with AFS usage. Women, even though generally less financially knowledgeable than men, are relatively less likely than men to use AFS borrowing. © 2019, © 2019 International Council for Small Business.

AB  - Purpose: Financial illiteracy could pose a significant challenge to micro-entrepreneurs. There is a pressing need to foster financial literacy;, therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine particularly how Islamic financial literacy may enhance their businesses toward achieving financial sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses quantitative methods. Three hundred (300) questionnaires were distributed to micro-entrepreneurs in three states in Malaysia, namely, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu. This study used the partial least squares (PLS) analysis using the SmartPLS 3.2. Findings: The study found that the most robust Islamic financial literacy factors are financial behavior, followed by financial knowledge and financial attitude.The outcome of Islamic financial literacy, which is financial sustainability, also demonstrates a positive and significant relationship. Social implications: All variables show a positive and significant relationship toward financial sustainability. Stated differently, micro-entrepreneurs are aware that understanding the basic concepts of Islamic finance may help them achieve long-term financial sustainability Originality/value: This study incorporates Islamic financial concepts into financial literacy while also assessing demographic aspects like years of business operation and education as moderators, which were not considered by previous studies. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Small retail businesses are essential for the growth of the South African economy. Though many of these business entities need more assets to seize business opportunities, previous research studies suggest that their overall access to finance through banks and other finance providers seems to be limited. In general, small retail businesses are usually managed by entrepreneurs who lack financial knowledge, but banks, when deciding on credit applications, rely heavily on financial information, which is provided by these entrepreneurs. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, this study aimed to explore barriers that limit access to finance for South African small retailers, from the perspectives of finance providers (banking institutions) and finance seekers (small retailers). Additionally, measures were highlighted to show how those hurdles could be overcome. Qualitative research was conducted, whereby data were collected via semi-structured interviews with management personnel at banks and other financial institutions, as well as independent experts and small retail business owners and managers. The findings show that many financing opportunities are available to small retail businesses, but access to these opportunities is limited mainly owing to, inter alia, strict bank regulations and factors that are inherent to small retail business owners. © Holger J.

AB  - Financial literacy is crucial to the growth and development of any enterprise. This study investigates the impact of microentrepreneurs’ demographic characteristics on financial literacy by breaking it down into three components: financial knowledge, financial behavior, and financial attitude. The study data were collected from 132 microentrepreneurs through a survey questionnaire using a snowball sampling technique. An ordinary least square regression was used to analyze how entrepreneurs’ demographic characteristics are related to financial knowledge, financial behavior, financial attitude, and financial literacy. The study revealed that being male, having higher education and more experience, and operating in urban areas have a significant impact on financial literacy and its three components. However, age was found to have no significant impact on financial literacy. This study will help in designing targeted strategies and specialized programs for entrepreneurs looking at the significant impact of their diverse characteristics on financial literacy. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the role of mental accounting, financial attitude, and financial self-efficacy on financial behavior. Furthermore, this study examines the effect of financial knowledge on mental accounting, financial attitude, and financial self-efficacy. This study uses 400 student respondents who have businesses. Data analysis using PLS. The results show that financial behavior is influenced by mental accounting, financial attitude, and financial self-efficacy. However, financial knowledge did not increase mental accounting and financial self-efficacy. This study proves that mental accounting is very important for student success in business. Mental accounting controls the mindset of young entrepreneurs in managing finances so that they have a positive financial attitude, good financial self-efficacy, and effective financial behavior. From this study, we believe that mental accounting plays an important role for young entrepreneurs in financial decision-making. However, financial knowledge does not necessarily influence the mental accounting mindset. © 2022 Radianto et al.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the need for knowledge acquisition tools and the level of knowledge acquisition in the context of financial knowledge, as well as the use of different knowledge acquisition tools by small restaurant entrepreneurs. This study involves two phases. In phase 1, a qualitative approach was employed using an in-depth interview method. In-depth interviews were conducted with 9 small restaurant entrepreneurs in order to obtain insight into their level of knowledge acquisition in the context of financial knowledge, their level of use for various knowledge acquisition tools (websites, Facebook, Line, YouTube, blogs, and mobile phone application), and their need for knowledge acquisition tools. Interview responses are explored using a thematic content analysis. In phase 2, a quantitative approach was employed using a survey questionnaire, collecting responses from 320 small restaurant entrepreneurs. Through data generated from questionnaire responses, a hierarchical multiple regression was used to determine the relationship between the need for knowledge acquisition tools, and the level of knowledge acquisition in the context of financial knowledge. Cluster analysis techniques were used to identify the level of use for various knowledge acquisition tools, distributing entrepreneurs into different levels. The Cochran Q-test and McNemar test were used to study the difference in use of each knowledge acquisition tool by these entrepreneurs. The result suggests that small restaurant entrepreneurs with a greater need for financial knowledge acquisition tools tentatively acquire more financial knowledge. There is a difference in the level of use of knowledge acquisition tools by entrepreneurs, while the tools most commonly used for gaining financial knowledge are websites and Facebook. © 2021, ABAC Journal.

AB  - This study examines the effects of the three proposed financial sophistication dimensions, that is, (1) knowledge; (2) behavior, and (3) decision-making style, on the triple bottom line (TBL) framework. Based on a sample of 384 micro-entrepreneurs across the National Capital Region (NCR) in the Philippines, results of PLS-SEM showed that the financial decision-making style had a positive effect on all areas of the TBL. Financial behavior showed to have positive effects on the economic and environmental aspects while financial knowledge only had a positive effect on the economic bottom line. Lastly, the relationship between female micro-entrepreneurs’ financial decision-making style and the economic bottom line was found to be significantly higher than that of male micro-entrepreneurs. Implications of these findings were also discussed. © 2019 by De La Salle University.

AB  - This study aims at investigating the financial knowledge, financial behaviour and the attitude towards finance amongst on small medium entrepreneurs (SMEs) in Kuching. More specifically on how these powerful factors affect the profitability on fast growing business enterprises in largest city in the Borneo Island over the last decade. The research takes a descriptive approach fitting its underlying pursue and draws interesting conclusions with over 75% response rate. Analysis of the data collected clearly reveals that the knowledge of finance in general relates significantly stronger to the bottom line of these business entities relative to the owners’ financial attitude and their ensuing behaviour towards financial decision making. Therefore, small medium entrepreneurs are highly recommended to participate in financial education on a regular basis to keep them well informed and equipped with the latest ways of managing the finances of their businesses to ensure better financial planning, execution and monitoring of enterprises that inevitably will lead to increased and sustainable earnings. © 2020, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

AB  - Exploring the financial behavior traits amidst the unexpected financial challenges and the unparalleled rise in fintech, this study provides insight into the interplay of entrepreneur digital financial literacy (EDFL), entrepreneur financial competency (EFC), and entrepreneur financial skill (EFS) impacting entrepreneur financial decision-making (EFDM). Toward this goal, data were gathered from 223 active women entrepreneurs from India who have accounts in the social media platform. The three-step hierarchical regression analysis disclosed that an entrepreneur with sound EDFL, EFS, and EFC can significantly enhance strategic decision-making (EFDM). The research outcome reveals that EFDM is a consistent predictor of the financial performance of women-owned enterprises. In addition, the entrepreneur’s financial decision-making does not mediate the relationship between financial experience, financial competency, financial skill budgeting, and financial skill_acumen with financial performance. In contrast, partial mediation is observed between digital financial awareness, digital financial knowledge, and financial skill_analytics. The novel insight accounted for a significantly low level of experience in entrepreneurs’ utilization of digital platforms for payment, financing loans, and asset management. The outcome carries academic, regulatory, and managerial significance, recognizing the unique interaction; the cumulative efforts strengthen the capacity to address socio-economic challenges and translate them into gender-specific policy interventions and practices. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The research aims to investigate the entrepreneurial skills and financial literacy’s impact on the improved performance in the biotechnology sector. Entrepreneurial skills enable the individual to manage the business through taking essential actions, and along with financial literacy the utilization of resources in an optimum way is assured as well. The decision maker would invest in development of organizational capabilities required to succeed in market. Being a high risky domain, the utilization of financial resources through financial knowledge is crucial in biotech sector. To conduct this research, the quantitative research design including survey approach has been adopted. Questionnaires were distributed followed by the statistical testing of data through SPSS. The results indicated a significant association among financial literacy and performance along with a significant association between entrepreneurial skills and performance of biotechnology firms in Swiss. The research holds greater theoretical and practical importance. This study suggests that financial learning and entrepreneurial skills pioneer the development of biotech firms by having a higher speed of innovation. Regarding its implications for public authorities, the substantial need to promote FL and ES is highlighted. Thus public policies extend entrepreneurial skills and financing knowledge by improving the decision-making process. © 2023 ThinkBiotech LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to understand the determinants of financial satisfaction in women entrepreneurs in their personal investment decisions. The study focusses on five behavioural biases - overconfidence, conservatism, mental accounting, loss aversion and self-control, which are considered as second order construct: investor bias. Other factors that influence financial satisfaction of women entrepreneurs are parental influence, expert advice, spouse effect and financial knowledge. The study further evaluates the relationship between investor bias, time for investment and financial satisfaction. A structured survey form was floated and inputs collected were analysed using Smart PLS 3. Study found that financial satisfaction in women entrepreneurs is impacted by investor bias, parental influence and expert advice. Time for investment does not moderate the relationship between individual investor bias and financial satisfaction. © Indian Institute of Finance.

AB  - Purpose: Intangible capital (IC) is an important factor for economic growth and firm performance. The role IC has played has become even more crucial in recent decades, possibly influencing debt capacity and default risk assessment. This paper studies how entrepreneurial and employee-based IC affects financial leverage. Design/methodology/approach: Employer–employee unbalanced panel data provided by Statistics Finland that refer to Finnish small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are used. Intangibles are measured with an expenditure-based method. Employee-based IC and entrepreneurial knowledge are used to explain debt financing in SMEs. Findings: The findings imply that IC-intensive firms have less debt capacity due to weak pledgeability and asymmetric information between borrower and lender. Entrepreneurs with managerial or financial knowledge increase the firm's debt capacity compared to other entrepreneurs, especially in knowledge-intensive services (KIS). One explanation is that the entrepreneurs are more competent in negotiating with lenders as the entrepreneurs possess better financial skills. Entrepreneurs with technical knowledge decrease the firm's debt capacity in all industries. Originality/value: While some earlier research focused on the IC–financial leverage relationship, hardly any study has looked at entrepreneurial IC. This paper provides new insights by including entrepreneurial IC alongside employee-based IC. © 2023, Antti Norkio.

AB  - Orientation: Among the numerous factors affecting small and medium enterprises’ (SMEs) ability to access funding, financial literacy or the lack thereof continues to rank high. The below-average levels of financial literacy among entrepreneurs inevitably restrict their access to finance, thereby adding to the already soaring rate of small business failure. Research purpose: The main research objective of this article is to determine the underlying financial literacy-financial access relationship among SMEs in the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality in South Africa. Motivation of the study: Understanding the relationship between financial literacy and financial access among small businesses is imperative as they are key players in economic development. Empirical literature outlining this relationship is sparse. Therefore, the study made an original empirical contribution to the financial literacy-financial access nexus in the metropolitan. Research design, approach and method: A quantitative descriptive research design was followed. The survey method was used to gather data, where structured questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. The study considered a targeted population of 5609 registered SMEs in Ekurhuleni with a sample size of 384 prospective participants. A total of 310 responses were obtained from the owners and managers of SMEs in the municipality. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used to compute all statitical analyses for the study. Descriptive statistics were used to establish the SMEs’ financial literacy and financial access relationship. Data were analysed using factor analysis, regression analysis and correlation analysis. Main findings: Entrepreneurs in Ekurhuleni were found to have a limited understanding of basic financial concepts implying low levels of financial knowledge. Additionally, the study established that financial access was significantly challenging for most SMEs. The findings further revealed a positive relationship between financial literacy and financial access. Practical managerial/ implications: The knowledge from this article may assist entrepreneurs and financial institutions in bridging the financial literacy gap, thereby increasing the likelihood of accessing funding by SMEs. It may also assist in influencing the development and implementation of micro and macroeconomics policies to raise financial literacy levels and leniency from financing sources towards SMEs. © 2023.

AB  - The present study explores the financing behaviour of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) owners. A nexus of owners’ personal attributes (PC) and behavioural aspects including financial knowledge (FK), financing motivation (M), and risk taking ability (R) has been created to determine the financing preferences (FP) and capital structure decision (CSD) of firm owners. The research framework adopts quantitative approach to the analysis. 274 responses were collected and analysed through partial least squares structural equation modelling on SmartPLSv2. The findings support the direct and mediating role of M and R in predicting FP and its relationship with PC. Moreover, the study confirms the role of FP in determining CSD in terms of pecking order behaviour among firm owners. The integration of owners’ personal characteristics and behavioural factors in determining firms’ financial decision adds value to the theory and practice of MSME financing.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurial activities, and the moderating effects of industrial regulation in the relationship between financial literacy and entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the role of financial literacy on entrepreneurial participation and performance is investigated through multi-sourced data from the Chinese Family Panel Studies with manually merged provincial and industrial data from 2014. Four hypotheses are tested based on Probit and Tobit models. Moreover, instrumental variable method and principal component analysis are applied to provide robustness checks. Findings: The empirical results demonstrate that financial literacy has significantly positive effects on entrepreneurial participation, as well as on entrepreneurial performance. In addition, industrial regulation positively moderates the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurial participation and performance, which indicates that financial literacy plays a more important role in promoting entrepreneurship in tightly regulated industries. Originality/value: This study proposes and tests the effects of financial literacy on entrepreneurial activities, which fills an important gap in the literature. The results in this paper provide evidence that financial literacy has positive impacts in both the entry and operation stages of entrepreneurship. This evidence provides theoretical foundations for policy making in popularizing financial knowledge and supporting entrepreneurial activities. Moreover, this research further reveals the effects of industrial regulation in the context of China, suggesting that the government should be more effective in promoting administrative decentralization and reducing unnecessary interventions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Business incubators (BIs) provide entrepreneurs with access to critical resources (for example, physical, financial, knowledge, social, legitimacy, and so on) that support venture development. Little is known about how support needs differ between entrepreneurs pursuing technology-based (TB) and creative-industry (CI) opportunities. Yet these differences may affect their ability to benefit from incubation. This is the first comparative study addressing this gap. Focusing on university BIs, our qualitative analysis reveals that TB entrepreneurs benefit from physical capital supporting proof of concept, financial grants, and technical and industry-specific knowledge capital. In contrast, CI entrepreneurs benefit from physical capital supporting product development, financing of smaller-scale projects, and knowledge capital focused on business basics. External legitimacy was more important to TB entrepreneurs, while internal social capital mattered more to CI entrepreneurs. We draw on value creation and capture to explain these differences. The findings have implications for research and practice concerned with incubation and university-based entrepreneurial support. © 2022 International Council for Small Business.

AB  - Purpose: This work aims to explore the relationship between entrepreneurial ecosystems' (EEs) inputs and outcomes within a digital-technology-driven EE. Specifically, it focuses on how being part of an EE enhances digital technology adoption (DTA) and consequently facilitates EE outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs a single-case study approach, focusing on Italian EE. The data analysis is based on the researchers' direct observations and semi-structured interviews with the EE founders' teams and the top management of the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating therein. Given the novelty of the topic and the lack of a clear research framework of analysis, a qualitative method is well suited for studying digital-technology-driven EE, thus gaining rich data about the phenomenon in a real-life context. Findings: The findings of the study reveal that when specific eco-inputs (financial, knowledge, social and institutional assets) are correctly exploited to enhance DTA, important outcomes, namely, SME competitiveness and new technology-based venture creation and development, are generated. Originality/value: The paper contributes to a relatively unexplored topic in the existing literature on EEs and digital technology. Specifically, through the proposition of a conceptual model, it sheds light on the relationship among EE inputs, DTA and EE outcomes. © 2023, Luca Marinelli, Sara Bartoloni, Alessandra Costa and Federica Pascucci.

AB  - Knowledge, general and specific, plays a role in entrepreneurship. Little is known about the role of general knowledge in entrepreneurial intentions. This study fills the gap by proposing financial knowledge as general knowledge and entrepreneurial education as specific knowledge, and investigates their effects on entrepreneurial intentions and the three motivational factors including attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Using survey data of 480 undergraduates and the structural equation modeling approach, we find a significant impact of financial knowledge on entrepreneurial intentions and all three motivational factors. Entrepreneurial education does not have a significant direct impact but has an indirect effect on entrepreneurial intentions through attitude and perceived behavioral control. These results are important to educators and policymakers to design appropriate policies to improve financial knowledge due to its significant role in entrepreneurial decisions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Purpose: The study focused on the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs at the Galerías Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia, from 2019 to 2023. Design/methodology/approach: The design of the paper is empirical-analytical, focusing on the tangible and unique aspects of reality that can be fragmented for measurement. This approach privileges the use of data from the study population’s experience, which is treated analytically through statistics to establish frequencies and correlations between variables. The research involved a structured questionnaire based on bibliographic references and considering the operational framework of the variables, which underwent expert review, necessary adjustments, a pilot test and subsequent validation in 2019 and 2023. The reliability of the instrument was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, ensuring a reliable indicator when equal to or greater than 0.7 in each analysis period. This methodology aimed to identify practices and how the financial profile influences short term. Findings: The findings from the survey conducted with the microentrepreneurs at Galerías Shopping Center reveal several significant connections to the theoretical framework. The study revealed that many microentrepreneurs relied on their personal funds for business financing, indicating a limited understanding of financial principles. Additionally, a significant portion of microentrepreneurs mitigated investment risk by securing loans from financial institutions, yet none utilized government subsidies like entrepreneurship loans, pointing to a lack of advice. The findings underscore the importance of financial education and suitable financial services for business development. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this study is the lack of detailed data on the financial structure of microentrepreneurs' businesses, as well as specific information on interest rates and the terms and conditions of the microcredit used. These limitations may affect the generalization of the results and the comprehensive understanding of the impact of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs. Future research could include a larger sample size and more accurate data on the financial structure of businesses, as well as a detailed investigation of interest rates and terms and conditions of microcredit, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the financial impacts for microentrepreneurs. Practical implications: The findings of this study have practical implications for microentrepreneurs in the Galerías Shopping Center. The research emphasizes the need for improved financial knowledge, accounting practices and debt management among microentrepreneurs. It also highlights the importance of financial education and access to suitable financial services for business development. The study’s insights can guide the development of training programs and initiatives aimed at enhancing financial literacy and financial management among microentrepreneurs, leading to more informed decision-making and improved financial outcomes. Social implications: From a social perspective, this research contributes to promoting economic development and financial inclusion. By addressing the mismanagement of microcredit by microentrepreneurs and providing insights into their short-term finances, the study aims to foster economic empowerment and sustainable development within communities. The findings underscore the significance of microfinance in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion. The research emphasizes the importance of equitable access to financial services, which can contribute to narrowing the gap between the financially excluded population and the conventional financial system. Originality/value: This research adds originality and value to the academic community by addressing the incidence of microcredit on the short-term finances of microentrepreneurs in the specific context of the Galerías Shopping Center in San Juan de Pasto, Colombia. By characterizing the financial profile of microentrepreneurs, establishing the relationship between microcredit characteristics and the financial profile and proposing an action plan, the study provides valuable insights for decision-making in both the academic and microfinance fields. The research contributes to the existing literature on microfinance and financial inclusion, offering a unique perspective and potential solutions for optimizing the use of microcredit-funded resources by microentrepreneurs. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Knowledge management tools and technology are the main factors bringing competitive advantage to organisations. This study extends the depth of study on small business entrepreneurs by examining the effect of knowledge acquisition, in particular financial knowledge that leads to the need for knowledge acquisition tools and technology. There is evidence to support that a lower level of existing financial knowledge in small business entrepreneurs encourages them to acquire more financial knowledge since they tend to be responsible for all tasks related to business survival. This finding is not consistent with several other previous studies. In addition, relevant knowledge on how to raise adequate capital to establish their business and the accurate calculation of cost are the two most important aspects of financial knowledge for encouraging small business entrepreneurs to seek effective knowledge acquisition tools and technology. The evidence provides insight for the government authorities supporting small businesses to provide financial knowledge to small business entrepreneurs during the pre-start-up phase and thereafter by providing the relevant knowledge on financing and cost calculation to strengthen and sustain these businesses. This will ultimately lead to an improvement in small business failure and increase the country’s economic growth. © 2020, The Author(s).
